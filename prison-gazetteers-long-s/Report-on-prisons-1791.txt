AT a Meeting of the General Committee of the Society for giving Effect to his Majesty's Proclamation, &c.

A Second Report of the Sub-Committee respecting Prisons and Houses of Correction, was read. Resolved that the Report be printed, and that the Sub-Committee be desired to make enquiry respecting the state of the Prisons in those counties, in England and Wales, concerning which, it is stated in the Report, that no information has been received by the Society.

REPORT, &c.

March 19, 1791.

THE Sub-Committee having examined the letters and other papers relating to Prisons and Houses of Correction, which have been received since the last publication of the Society, report as follows:

By a letter from Mr. Sharp, it appears that the Prison in Dover Castle is by no means fit for the purpose for which it is intended. This letter has, by the direction of the Committee, been communicated to the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, who has been so good as to say, that he will readily cooperate with the Society, in every thing which

[ 6 ]

may tend to remove the grievances complained of.

By a letter from the late Deputy Governor of the Isle of Man, it appears, that in that island there is but one Prison, which consists of only two rooms, one of which is a Dungeon for Felons, very dark, wet, and unwholesome, but, happily, very little used: the other room is sixteen feet by twelve, and nine or ten feet high. In this room are confined all other prisoners of all descriptions, debtors as well as criminals, women as well as men. This letter is earnestly recommended to the attention of the General Committee.

By a paper communicated by one of the Members of the Society, it appears, that in Oxfordshire the Magistrates continue to he successful, both in saving money for the county, and in the still more important object of reforming the morals of the prisoners.

The following improvements are mentioned in letters received by the Secretary.

In Durham, the County Gaol has been repaired and enlarged.

[ 7 ]

In Northamptonshire, the Magistrates are employed in improving and enlarging the County Gaol, and in building a House of Correction on an improved plan.

In Leicestershire, a new County Gaol is almost finished, in which a proper separation will be made of the different classes of prisoners.

In Buckinghamshire, Cells for solitary imprisonment have been built in the County Gaol at Aylesbury, and some other improvements have been made.

By a letter from one of the Members of the Society, the Sub-Committee are informed, that in Wiltshire several improvements have been lately made in the County Gaol, and others are intended to be made, as expeditiously as the finances of the county will permit.

In Hampshire, a new County Gaol and County Bridewell, on improved plans, have been built, and the keepers assert, that they have great reason to believe, the goed efffects produced

[ 8 ]

on the prisoners, will not be found inferior to the expectations of the Magistrates.

In Sussex (one of the first counties which set an example in the reform of prisons), the very best effects continue to arise from the attention of the Magistrates. The County Gaol at Horsham, and the Bridewell at Petworth, are exceedingly well regulated; the prisoners have separate cells; scarce any illness is known, and it is found by experience, that most of those persons who have been once confined in the House of Correction, take care not to render themselves liable to be sent there a second time. In that county only six prisoners were tried at the Summer assize. The Lent assize was a Maiden one.

In Kent, it has been recommended by the Grand Jury to the Magistrates at the Quarter Sessions, to make some alterations which are much wanted in the County Gaol. It does not, however, appear, that any such alterations have as yet been undertaken.

It was mentioned in the last Report, that the County Gaol in Surrey had been presented

[ 9 ]

by the Grand Jury at the Lent assize. In consequence of this presentment, a bill has been brought into Parliament for building a new Gaol in that county.

In Essex, a new County Gaol was built a few years ago; the Bridewell is old and inconvenient, but it is intended to build a new one on an improved plan. At Colchester some new rooms have been lately added to the Bridewell.

In Suffolk, a new County Gaol is just finished at Ipswich. In this building every prisoner, debtor as well as felon, will have a separate cell, and every circumstance has been attended to, which can contribute to render the prison healthy and secure; and to promote industry and regularity among the prisoners. The Old Gaol at Ipswich, compared with the New one, affords a striking contrast, and an example of what an English Prison was, before the attention of the Public was called to this subject by Mr. Howard, and what an English Prison may be, when built on a proper plan, and conducted by active and attentive Magistrates.

[ 10 ]

The Bridewells in Suffolk have been much improved. Cells for solitary imprisonment have been provided at Beccles and at Woodbridge, and the prisoners are properly employed during their confinement.

In the same letter it is mentioned as the result of pretty close inspection, that the Bridewell at Wymondham, in Norfolk, really deserves the character given of it by Mr. Howard. The only defect mentioned by him is now removed, the allowance of bread being two pounds a day, instead of two-pennyworth. The prisoners are kept entirely separate, and are constantly at work. Those who are employed in hickling hemp, are expected to earn 5s. a week; those who bunch it, 3s. Whatever they gain above these sums, is given them at their discharge. Such as are diligent, and behave well, are indulged with a lamp till eight oâ€™clock in the evening, when all lights are put out. This enables them in winter to work three or four hours longer than they otherwise could do. Some prisoners in the week previous to the writing this account, had earned 10s. The keeper mentioned the names of thirteen persons, who had been in

[ 11 ]

this Bridewell, and who, to his knowledge, earned an honest livelihood by the exercise of that trade which they had learnt during their confinement. The profits of the prisoners labour continue to exceed the expence of maintaining them. The Bridewells in Norfolk being all properly regulated, the attention of the Magistrates, is now employed on the County Gaol. A new one on an improved plan is begun, in which separate cells, and other proper conveniences, will be provided.

At Cambridge, a new Gaol and new Bridewell, with cells for solitary confinement, have been lately built by the city. It is said that the Magistrates of the county have it also in contemplation, to provide a remedy for the defects which have been long complained of in the County Gaol, and County Bridewell. At Wisbech the prison has lately been thoroughly repaired, and very much improved.

In Huntingdonshire, a new Gaol and new Bridewell have been built, and although they are not executed in the best manner, they are much superior to the old ones.

[ 12 ]

In Berkshire, a County Bridewell was lately built at Reading, on a very good plan. What has been formerly mentioned at Wymondham, and several other places, is here confirmed, viz., that solitary imprisonment, independent of other good effects, has been the means of bringing many prisoners to make confessions, by which several gangs of rogues have been discovered, and dispersed. The Country Gaol at Reading is old, and not a good one, but it is kept clean, and great pains have been taken by the Magistrates to establish good regulations for the government of it.

It is observed in the letter from which these observations are taken, that no appearance of the gaol fever was found in any of the prisons which were visited by the writer. In most of them the infirmaries were empty, and the gaolers all said, that they had never seen any contagious fevers of that kind since the new prisons were built; unless, as one or two of them added, they were brought by prisoners from Newgate.

From the preceding observations, and those formerly published, the Sub-Committee think themselves warranted to assert, that wherever

[ 13 ]

the attention of the Magistrates has been exerted in providing proper Gaols and Houses of Correction, and in establishing good regulations for the management of them, their endeavours have been productive of such good effects, as have fully answered the expectations of those who were most sanguine in their hopes of improvement.

The Sub-Committee are happy to add, that in addition to the eight counties of York, Lincaster, Norfolk, Suffolk, Oxford, Gloucester, Sussex, and Cornwall, which were mentioned by Mr. Howard as having been particularly active in this reform, it appears from this, and their former Report, that new prisons have been lately built, are now building, or intended immediately to be built, in the counties of Devon, Dorset, Southampton, Berks, Surrey, Middlesex, Essex, Hertford, Bedford, Huntingdon, Lincoln, Leicester, Northampton, Warwick, Stafford, Chester, Salop, Hereford, Monmouth, and Carmarthen. Improvements, more or less complete, have been undertaken in the counties of Wilts, Worcester, Durham, Buckingham, and Cambridge. With respect to the remaining eight counties of

[ 14 ]

Somerset, Kent, Rutland, Derby, Nottingham, Westmorland, Cumberland, and Northumberland, the Sub-Committee have received no authentic information, and therefore recommend it to the General Committee, to make some enquiry into the date of the Prisons in those counties, and whether the Pamphlets sent by the Society were distributed to the Justices at their Quarter Sessions.

No information has been obtained of the state of the Prisons in Wales, except (as mentioned in a former Report) that a new County Gaol, on a large and convenient plan, is now building at Carmarthen. An enquiry into the state of the Welsh Prisons, is therefore recommended to the General Committee.

Of the Prisons in the Metropolis, the Sub-Committee have received no accounts, except a letter from Mr. Alderman Watson, mentioning some improvements intended to be made in Newgate: the Sub-Committee have therefore, as they did last year, desired one of their Members to make some enquiry into the state of those prisons, the result of which enquiry will be laid before the General Committee at their next meeting.

POSTSCRIPT.

May 12, 1791.

SINCE the preceding Report was presented to the Society, letters have been received from the Clerks of the Peace of the counties of Northumberland, Derby, Nottingham, Kent, Flint, Pembroke, and Radnor.

From the first of these letters it appears, that a new House of Correction has been lately built at Hexham; and another is intended to be built in the parish of Tynemouth, in which cells for solitary imprisonment will be provided. Six cells for this purpose have also been added to the county Gaol, since the distribution of the Pamphlets sent by the Society.

( 18 )

In Derbyshire, a new and convenient Bridewell has been lately built at Tideswell; two others are begun at Ashbourne, and Winckworth; and the old House of Correction at Chesterfield, has been repaired and enlarged. These improvements have been made since the distribution of the Pamphlets.

In Nottinghamshire several alterations and improvements have been made in the county Gaol; and a new prison having been built for the town of Nottingham, the county prisoners are less crowded than they used to be. The House of Correction at Southwell has also been improved; and further alterations, both in it and in the county Gaol, are now under the consideration of the magistrates.

In a letter from the Deputy-Clerk of the Peace for the county of Kent, it is mentioned, that the county is now much burthened with the expence of having a few years ago added a new wing to the old Gaol, in order to separate the debtors from the felons. No further alteration has for this reason been made in the police of this county.

( 19 )

In Pembrokeshire a new county Gaol was built at Haverfordwest, a short time before Mr. Howard's last publication. A county Gaol was also built at Flint about the same time.

In Radnorshire, the county Gaol at Presteign has been well and sufficiently improved, and was reported, by the Judges at the last assizes, to be in very good repair. A New House of Correction has also been provided by this county.
