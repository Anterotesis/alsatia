APPENDIX.

THE House of Commons having taken under consideration the regulation of prisons, I thought myself bound, by the promise made in the conclusion of my late publication, to collect such farther hints as I might be able to procure in several foreign Territories there mentioned. I therefore visited them and some other countries, and shall subjoin those remarks which seemed most worthy of attention.

In the Draught of a Bill "to punish by Imprisonment and Hard Labour, certain Offenders; and to establish proper Places for their Reception,*" the plan was formed on the Rasp and Spin-houses in Holland. This made me more solicitous to gain the best information, by a fresh inspection, and by conversation with intelligent men. In pursuance of this design, I went to Holland in April 1778, and cheerfully entered on the intended business of my journey at

ROTTERDAM,

[Stadt-house.]

WHERE I revisited the Stadt-house prison, in which were no debtors in either of the three rooms. When there are any, they are alimented at one fixed sum, viz. sixteen stivers.* There are seven rooms for criminals or disorderly persons. One of them is called the condemned room, into which a criminal is put fourteen days before his final sentence; and immediately after the sentence, he is executed with a solemnity very striking to the common people. In three of the rooms, were three persons confined for a limited time for some small offences, and kept to bread and water. Their daily allowance was from four to five stivers, and their pitcher was filled with water three times a day; but the other criminals had their pitcher filled once a day with beer, and their allowance was from nine to ten stivers. There were cases with thick straw mats, and two or three coverlids to each.

[Rasp-house.]

In the Rasp-house (or Spin-house, as it should more properly be called) the thirty-eight men who were there, were spinning, except two who were cutting or rasping logwood, and a few who were carding wool, making fishing-nets, and sorting coffee-berries. The women were all employed in spinning, carding, or winding at a great wheel. They were clean, and appeared healthy and well. I observed the ceiling

* A guinea 252d. is = 11 guilders 11 stivers = 231 stivers (for 20 stivers is a guilder) therefore stivers are to pence as 231/252 = 11/12 i.e. 11 stivers is equal to a shilling.

[Rotterdam rasp-house.]

to be white: one of the directors informed me that it was white-washed regularly twice a year.

The men were more separated than the women, into rooms which measured about fourteen feet by seventeen, and each of which contained only four or five. For preventing combinations, two of them are removed every ten or fourteen days, to different companies. In those rooms were some Jews, whose dinner was not pork, as was that of the other prisoners, but mutton, which their society in the city sent them, with a slice of white bread, by permission of one of the five regents or inspectors.*

The whipping-post is in the middle of the yard, in full view of the men criminals. For the more refractory, there are dark rooms, but not dungeons: in one of these, on shutting the door on myself, I found no dampness. My conductor observed, that the floor was raised to preserve it dry. Here they are allowed no bedding, and are kept to bread and water, which is given them at an aperture in the door. Their confinement is for six, eight, ten, or fourteen days.

The keeper has a salary from the city, of four hundred florins or guilders per annum,† and also a house, victuals and drink, firing and candle, and one seventh part of the produce of all the labour of the prisoners; so that it is his interest to see that the work be well performed:

* As I was there at one o'clock, the time of the distribution, I observed that the bread was all cut in slices: this prevents those contests or frauds which sometimes happen where prisoners mess together, and the bread is given out in one loaf, as I saw on board the hulks in the Thames, where one loaf was given to six persons.

† About £36.

[Rotterdam Rasp-house.]

yet as the quantum is fixed by the regents, it is not in his power to be a cruel task-master. The manner of dieting the prisoners seemed to me worthy of being inserted at length in the note below.*

Being at Rotterdam on a Sunday, I was desirous of seeing, whether there was such dissipation in their prisons, as there is in ours, on that

* Regulation for the daily diet, at the Rasp-house at Rotterdam.

Sunday Dinner. Each man has a mess of boiled grout, with butter or kitchen-stuff; a piece of cheese or butter, with a quarter of a pound of rye breed.

day. The public service at the Rasp-house began at half after one o'clock. The audience consisted of about thirty or forty inhabitants of the town, Mr. Schumaker the presiding regent, the head-keeper and his family, and three under-keepers, besides the prisoners. The number of women prisoners was about forty, who were separated from the rest of the congregation by a wooden palisade, and seated on benches

[Note continued.]

Thursday Dinner. Boys, or men who only do half-task, one fourth of a pound of meat, or one twelfth of a pound of pork without bone; two slices of rye bread, weighing together three eighths of a pound, with each a bowl of barley broth. Ditto ditto. The women, no meat or pork; each a bowl of barley broth, with three eighths of a pound of rye bread with butter or cheese.

raised one above another. They were all clean and neat; had nothing distinguishing in their dress, but were without hats. While they stood up during prayer, they held up their aprons to cover their faces. The men were neat, dressed in brown coats, had been shaved, had clean shirts (which were most of them chequed), clean stockings, and wore handkerchiefs about their necks. They also were seated on raised benches, in a room out of the chapel, and separated from it by an iron grating, from the top of the room to the bottom, so wide that all the audience, except the female prisoners, had them full in view. The keeper's seat adjoins to this grating, and two of his servants, who are turnkeys, sat observing their behaviour.

The chaplain, after a short prayer, preached extempore; then, the men convicts joined in singing, most of them having books: When the chaplain had prayed again, he catechised for about three quarters of an hour. It being the women's turn that Sunday, six of them stood up, one after another, and made the responses, which the chaplain explained to them. After this he prayed, and the service concluded by singing the fifty-first Psalm. The decent behaviour and attention of the audience, evidently proved that the service, though of two hours and an half, was not tedious or disagreeable.

During the time of catechising, the head-keeper and one of his servants went out, to inspect the empty wards, and to search whether any tools or instruments were concealed. The keeper returned to his seat in an hour. At the end of the service, the women passed by the regent's seat,* and when they were gone, he went into the court

* The seat is large enough for all the five regents or inspectors: but only one is obliged to attend, and this they do by rotation.

HOLLAND. 9

[Rotterdam Rasp-House.]

to see the men go to their several wards, four or five together,* that number only being let out a time. After they were all locked up, he went to each window, and conversed with them. Many of them returned their thanks for the abridgment of their term of confinement, as this was just before the time for electing new magistrates. One or two, who had been at sea, intreated to go in any capacity to India, as is sometimes permitted. He afterwards went to the grates of the women's wards, and conversed with them; and gave the catechumens some token of his approbation.

I cannot forbear closing this account, with mentioning the ardent wishes it inspired in me, that our prisons also, instead of echoing with profaneness and blasphemy, might hereafter resound with the offices of religious worship; and prove, like these, the happy means of awakening many to a lense of their duty to God and man.

[Goude.]

At La Porte, the prison at Goude, there is a small room for debtors, which the keeper informed me had not been occupied since 1761. There are many (octagon) rooms, but all empty: some are assigned to those who are committed for small offences, and kept to bread and water, for which there is an allowance to each of them of three stivers a day. - In the Spin-house the prisoners were all employed in carding and spinning wool for stockings. On observing little towels hanging in one room, they told me, that each of them had one clean every week. Here were some prisoners from the Hague, and other towns which have no rasp-houses, who were admitted at a stipulated

annual sum, of about a hundred and ten florins for each, besides fifteen for cloathing. - Near this city is inclosed a triangular gallows, with an inscription over the gate,

Recte faciendo neminem timeas.

The best translation of which may be the words of Scripture,

"The righteous is bold as a lion."

[Harlem Spin-house.]

At Harlem, the Spin-house (which is the work-house or poor-house) being old, is not so airy and commodious as modern buildings. Here were about thirty male and fifteen female offenders. The latter were at work with the mother (as they call her) making and mending the linen of the house. The former were weaving coarse linen, in which, at the distance of every six inches, there was a blue stripe, to distinguish the linen of the house, and to prevent its being in any manner disposed of elsewhere. One person was working at a loom on flowered silk damask, because that had been his former trade. Taylors were also employed in the way of their profession. The room in which the women worked, and that in which they slept, were quite clean. Each bed had two persons allotted to it, and they were all allowed sheets. The poor here, as in other work-houses in Holland, were cleanly and decently clad.

[Harlem Hospital.]

In this city is a noble hospital, airy and spacious, called the Proeveniers, in which the persons admitted are decently provided with meat, drink and lodging during their lives, and a burying-place at their decease. Persons of all ages from twenty to the most advanced period are admitted, though it is not common for any under forty to

HOLLAND. 11

[Harlem Hospital.]

apply for admission. At entrance, each person pays a greater or smaller sum, according to his age, as by the table in the note.* A common table is provided for all who are not sick or infirm. If any, after residing some time, choose to have their victuals brought to their rooms, rather than eat in common, they must pay for that privilege according to their age, one fifth part of the sum that would be required for admission at that age. For example, if a person of seventy years of age chooses to eat in his apartments, he must pay one fifth of the admission money required at the age of seventy, namely, four hundred and twenty florins.

It often happens that there are not vacant places, when persons desire admission. But many secure places before a vacancy, by paying two hundred florins in advance of their entrance money in consequence of which, their names are inscribed in a list, and the money deducted from the sum required when they enter.

Those who choose to leave the house entirely, receive, during the remainder of their lives, a certain, though very small, interest of the sum which they paid at admission.*

[Amsterdam Stadt-House.]

At Amsterdam I more than once revisited the prisons. At the Stadt-house were eighteen debtors; and there were five criminals, but their offences not being capital, all the strong rooms under ground were empty. The debtors are on the ground-floor. I often conversed with them, and found that they were all alimented alike: the first fourteen days at eleven stivers (a shilling) a day; after that time at five stivers and a half. But this is paid to the gaoler, who has great profit out of it, as appeared from the daily allowance which I weighed several times. Each debtor has from the city one quart of beer daily, and turf for firing. The rooms were clean, though the prisoners are never out of them, unless twice in a year at the times of white-washing.

From a book containing the names and crimes of all who have been executed at Amsterdam, from January 1693 to the end of 1766, I find it necessary to retract the assertion "that for a hundred years past there have not been executed, communibus annis, more than one a year." From this publication, the following state of executions at different periods are drawn.

From 1693 to 1735 (43 years) - 288.

1736 - 1745 (10 years) - 20.

1746 - 1766 (21 years) - 28.

And I have been well informed. that in the three years preceding my last visit, there was only one criminal executed, who was beheaded.

* For this account I am indebted to Dr. Maclaine, the worthy minister of the English church at the Hague.

HOLLAND. 13

[Amsterdam.]

An observation before escaped me, concerning the attention of the magistrates to the children of the malefactors who are executed. They are sent to the orphan-house, and there brought up in industry, and not left destitute vagabonds, to become unhappy victims to the wickedness and folly of their parents.

Perhaps the computation which I have mentioned of two hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants in this city may be too great;* though, if I mistake not, Mr. Karsseboom, some time since, estimated them at two hundred and forty-three thousand; and of late, many Jews banished from other countries have made an addition to the number. But Dr. Price reckons that they hardly amount to two hundred thousand.†

The four regents‡ who manage the Rasp-house are appointed by the burgomasters, to whom they are accountable. The gaoler or father

[Amsterdam Rasp-house.]

is strictly obliged to obey all the orders of the high-officer, the burgomasters, and also of the regents. In no case may he, or any of his family, receive a gift from the prisoners or their friends, either before or after their enlargement. He must not entrust a servant with the keys, but must himself carefully search the convicts and their cots, or rooms, before he locks them up in the evening, at six o'clock in summer, and at four in winter. The father must never be absent for a night, without special permission. He is severely punished if any prisoner escapes. He must register in order all acts concerning commitments and discharges, and produce them to the regents when required. Also he must keep an exact register of the cloaths, and all other things which belong to those confined.

The regents assemble in the house at four o'clock every Wednesday afternoon, to collect and examine the transactions of the preceding week. They appoint a servant to give any necessary assistance to the father, and particularly to cut the slices of bread for the prisoners; and when the father is ill, in the evening to visit and examine the cots.

In the nine lower rooms of this house, in June 1778, were confined upwards of forty prisoners. Each of these rooms, in which they work in the day and are locked up at night, contains at least four persons. The same prisoners do not continue long together, but are removed and separated once a fortnight or oftener. Few or none of them were rasping logwood, but most of them chopping it, for the two mills belonging to the house: for it was found to be too laborious for most of the prisoners, to work with six or eight saws, which often weigh seventy or eighty pounds. The medical

HOLLAND. 15

[Amsterdam Rasp-House.]

gentlemen, who daily visit the prison, informed the magistrates that it had been the cause of frequent ruptures.*

No friends of the prisoners are permitted to visit them, without express orders from the regents, unless on Mondays: and then they must be searched, to prevent the introduction of spirituous liquors, or instruments for breaking out, or any thing else forbidden: and they must retire before the time for shutting up. Every visitant is obliged to put two stivers into a box entrusted with the father. Refreshments may be received and given to the convicts on Tuesdays; but not on other days. Every evening, at eight o'clock, the father must see that all things are in due order. The saws, and other heavy implements for their work, are taken from them in the evening, and returned in the morning. If a convict be guilty of breaking any thing considerable, or of neglect or disobedience, he is punished severely by whipping, or confined to bread and water in a dungeon under ground.

Prayers are read morning and evening, and before and after meals, by one of the best-behaved convicts: and divine service, with a sermon, is performed by a clergyman on Sunday mornings.

Once a year, a little before the change of the regency, the high-officer and magistrates, with a secretary, attended by the inferior officers of justice, come to this prison, in order to contract or lengthen

the terms of confinement of the convicts, according to their good or bad behaviour, as represented by the regents.

The house provides for the prisoners diet,* cloaths, shoes and stockings, with shirts of half-bleached Flemish linen.

Some persons are confined in private rooms, to which none have access, unless in the presence of a regent. Great care is enjoined the

[Spin-house.]

The Spin-house is for women. This, and the Work-house, are under the direction of six regents and four governesses: who appoint two fathers and two mothers to superintend and inspect the work, the diet,† and the lodging of the prisoners; and to chastise the disobedient.

* There are many of these rooms, or houses of confinement in Holland called Verbeterkuizen. The regulations of some of them I collected; but as they are liable to abuse, and contrary to the general notions of public justice, I cannot but wish that they were universally suppressed.

18 APPENDIX.

[Amsterdam Spin-house.]

The work-room, is a large room up stairs, separated by a wooden balustrade from the passage (six feet wide) into which spectators are admitted. This room is divided by balustrades into three, for distinguishing those who have suffered some public or corporal punishment, from the others who have not been whipped, and exposed on a scaffold.

The mother was seated at a desk (where she had a full view of her family at work) with a Bible before her. By calling there on Whitsun-Monday, I found that they keep the same holidays as at the Rasp-house.

The kitchen, the dining and lodging-rooms, were on the ground floor. In each of the three bed-rooms were ten wooden cases, with a straw mattress, two coverlids, sheets, and one large pillow, for two persons. All were clean, and shewed the attention of the regents.

[Tax.]

This house is supported by a small annual tax on those who sell tobacco, beer and other liquors, and one fourth part of what is received at public exhibitions and diversions.

[Work-house.]

The old Rasp-house or Work-house is worthy of observation, as a well-regulated house of industry.* In one large room were forty-six women carding, spinning and reeling; twelve, weaving coarse linen or sail-cloth; thirteen, making and mending linen; and one employed

in keeping the room clean: the mother had a slate, with the names of the prisoners before her.* Some men and boys were in another large room, in which were many looms. But most of the men were at work in the courts, boiling and picking oakum, for caulking the seams of ships. I counted also forty or fifty women among them, at the same employment.

The women's bed-room is spacious; and I found it clean and in order, though I was there before ten o'clock in the forenoon.

This house was provided with (what seems to be much wanted in the Dutch prisons in general) an infirmary. But it was too small and close for the purpose.†

The diet of the prisoners is the same as in the Spin-house. ‡ Their provisions are bought in considerable quantities. The rye for bread was on the floor in an airy room, and was sweet and good. The produce of the prisoners' work is applied to the maintenance of the

‡ Though in this house, and the Spin-house, as well as in most of the other houses of correction in Holland, the prisoners have meat only on Sundays, yet the pease, beans, barley, &c. are always made into a kind of thick soup or pottage, which is palatable, and is served up hot at noon.

[Amsterdam Work-house.]

house, and the deficiency is made up from the Spin-house tax. The expence for each prisoner is full five stivers a day. Their number is generally from a hundred and eighty, to two hundred.

[Utrecht]

In the Stadt-house at Utrecht were no debtors, and only one criminal, and his offence was not capital. The allowance to debtors, (by their creditors) the first week, is twenty-eight stivers a day; the second week, sixteen; and every day afterwards, eight stivers. The state allows criminals thirteen stivers a day, which are paid to the gaoler. There has not been an execution, for the city or province, in the last fourteen years.

[Spin-house.]

I went over the Spin-house with Mr. Van Goens, one of the magistrates, to whose kindness I am indebted for the following account of the instructions to the keeper. In this house were thirty-seven men, and thirty-four women. The criminals were employed in spinning wool. The men were three in a room. The women were separated, according to their crimes, as they are in the Spin-house at Amsterdam.

The overseer or keeper has a house for the residence of himself and his family, and an annual salary of a thousand guilders from the states, and a hundred and thirty from the city, clear of all deductions. According to the copy of instructions, he must not be absent a night out of the city, without leave from the chief officer and the regents. He must, with assistants, search every part of the cells twice a week, to see whether any thing be done, - attempted, - or introduced, that is not permitted: and he must carefully inspect all things that are conveyed to the prisoners, that no tools, or glass, no gin or other strong liquors may be concealed: and he must

HOLLAND. 21

[Utrecht Spin-house.]

himself, or one of his family, be present when any persons come to see the house; and no more than six visitants are to be admitted at one time. He must see that the provisions for the prisoners be good; and take care that the manufacturer pays the same for their work, as he would if he employed others. He must confine those condemned for a long term, in strong rooms separate from the rest. He may correct moderately; but if the prisoners are refractory, and deserve severer punishment, he must inform the regents. By a particular permission from the magistrates, he may take in as boarders, persons of bad behaviour, at the desire of their parents, guardians or relations.

The regents only can appoint, or discharge, a servant, or turnkey.

[Deventer.]

At Deventer, the prison is near the river Issel. It consists of four rooms, which were all clean and sanded, but had no prisoners. When there are any, sixteen stivers a day are paid for each; which the gaoler receives, as at most other towns. Prisoners for capital offences are removed to the Stadt-house, where the same allowance is continued.

[Middleburg.]

The rooms in the prison at Middleburg are spacious, lofty, and clean. The three dungeons are used to force a confession; as there is no direct torture, and the criminal is not executed till the crime is confessed. The allowance to a criminal is eight stivers a day.

[Spin-House.]

In the house of correction, the prisoners were employed in weaving cloth or sacking for the East India company. This is more profitable than their late employment on coarse carpeting. None were in irons. No more than four persons were in any of the men's rooms; in some

22 APPENDIX.

[Middleburg.]

there were but two. Each criminal pays three guilders at his entrance, and the same at his discharge.

[Breda.]

The prison at Breda is an old tower. The allowance to criminals is five stivers a day. I was informed, that the torture stool in the chamber of examination has not been used for three years past.

[Spin-house.]

In the new house of correction were eleven men and two women prisoners, all employed on coarse carpeting; which is like the Scotch carpeting, but much cheaper. The specimen which I purchased, cost only eleven stivers, or a shilling their ell, which is two feet four inches. I here give the plan of the house taken by the builder, who has been particularly attentive to certain apartments which delicacy forbids enlarging upon, though they are of the greatest importance to the preservation of the health of prisoners.

The old house of correction was burnt down about five years since, and seven women perished in the flames. In the construction of the new prison, the magistrates have taken proper precautions against such an accident.

I leave this country with regret, as it affords a large field for information on the important subject I have in view. I know not which to admire most, the neatness and cleanliness appearing in the prisons, the industry and regular conduct of the prisoners, or the humanity and attention of the magistrates and governors.*

* I should accuse myself of ingratitude, did not I take this occasion again to express my acknowledgments to Sir Joseph Yorke; who not only in this, as in my former visits to Holland, exerted himself with ardour to promote the success of my enquiries; but while I was confined at the Hague in consequence of an accident, favoured me with instances of kindness and friendship that I never can forget.

HOLLAND. 23

Nothing can be more unreasonable than the pretences used among us to justify inattention and negligence. I cannot help taking this occasion to add the following authorities on this subject. All unprejudiced persons must acknowledge the absolute necessity of fresh air and cleanliness to preserve and promote health. To this purpose Dr. Mead writes, in his Discourse concerning Pestilential Contagion.* "Nothing approaches so near to the first original of contagion, as air pent up, loaded with damps, and corrupted with the filthiness, that proceeds from animal bodies. Our common prisons afford us an instance of this, in which very few escape, what they call the gaol fever, which is always attended with a degree of malignity in proportion to the closeness and stench of the place. And it would certainly very well become the wisdom of the government, as well with regard to the health of the town, as in compassion to the prisoners, to take care, that all houses of confinement, should be kept as airy and clean, as is consistent with the use, to which they are designed." - And "as nastiness is a great source of infection, so cleanliness is the greatest tc preservative." - From the general practice of foreigners in building their prisons near the water, it seems, that they were convinced of the bad effects of offensive drains, and of the necessity of cleanliness; and they had no apprehensions of bad consequences arising from such a situation. Dr. Heberden has expressed his sentiments on this subject in the Medical Transactions.† "In England few make any doubt of the great danger attending wet rooms: - Is this opinion founded upon experience, or is it a prejudice, which has been suffered to grow up and get strength merely for want of being examined ? If

"we enquire into the arguments in favor of this notion, we shall hardly find any other, than the random conjectures of the sick about the cause of their illness; or than their artfully substituting this origin of it instead of some other, which they are unwilling to own. - The air from rivers and from the sea is probably more replenished with vapors, than inland countries cleared of their woods; yet the most celebrated of antient physicians recommended the bank of a running river for the situation of a house, on account of its peculiar healthiness; and many invalids are sent by the modern physicians to the sea side, only for the benefit of the sea air."

GERMANY.

[Osnabrug.]

I went into Germany in June 1778, by Osnabrug and Hanover. The prison at Osnabrug I should entirely omit, did I not entertain a hope, that the account of it may possibly engage the notice of an amiable Prince who is the present bishop, and so be the means of alleviating the sufferings of the miserable prisoners. The prison and the house of correction is one large building, situated in an airy part of the suburbs, near a brook. A Latin inscription over the gate implies, that it was erected "at the public expense, in 1756, for the purposes of public justice and utility, by confining and punishing the wicked." - There are seventeen chambers for criminals, which have

GERMANY. 25

[Osnabrug.]

no light but by a small aperture over each door. I was happy to find here no more than one prisoner. He had been confined three years, and had survived the cruelty of the torture. In another part of the house I found many miserable and sickly objects, men, women and children, almost all without shoes and stockings. They were spinning in, different rooms, which were dirty beyond description. These rooms open into a passage, which a gentleman in office in the city, to whom I was recommended, durst not enter. I enquired of the keeper, concerning several particulars in the diet, &c. but the misery expressed in the countenances of the prisoners, made me totally disregard the information given me by words.

[Brunswick.]

At Brunswick I visited the habitation of the slaves, who lay on barrack bedsteads without beds. They had heavy irons, and their countenances were unhealthy.

The prison for capital offences is over one of the gates. It consists of three rooms, but none of them had been occupied for a considerable time. It was about eleven years since the last execution.

[Magdeburg.]

At Magdeburg the Prussian slaves were at work on the fortifications, serving the masons, digging sand, &c. Their daily allowance is two pounds of bread, and on the days they work, they have also in money, half a grosche, about three farthings. Their number was only fifty-one, for many had been taken to recruit the army.

In the other two prisons, nothing seemed worthy of observation: but in the house of correction (which was formerly a convent) was a mill to grind or beat the logwood that the men rasped; and two or thren large chambers of silk-worms, on which the women attended.

26 APPENDIX.

[Berlin.]

At Berlin, in the city prison, called Calandshof, were eighteen men and thirteen women in fifteen rooms, in each of which was a stove. The men and women have the use of the court-yard at different hours. The allowance to each is one grosche and twelve pfennigs, about two pence three farthings, a day. There is a chapel. There is no torture room in any of the prisons in the Prussian dominions, for the present king has set the example in Germany of abolishing the cruel practice. In one of the rooms of this prison are alphabetically digested, the names and descriptions, with the sentences, of all who have been confined in that prison, in order that if they are found there a second time, they may suffer a much severer punishment.

In another prison, called the Haus-vogtey, are sixteen rooms, eight for criminals, and over these the other eight for debtors and smugglers: these rooms look into a court, to which the prisoners have access two hours in a day. All the rooms have stoves. The allowance here to criminals is one grosche (seven farthings) a day; but debtors have two grosche, and in winter, one besides for firing.

[Maison De Travail.]

The Maison de Travail, is a spacious building in the suburbs: it was erected about twenty years since: the front is two hundred and twenty feet, the sides a hundred and sixty. It has a court in the centre. The number of inhabitants were about four hundred and fifty, including fourteen children. Beggars and idle persons of both sexes are sent to this house. Those who can work are employed, fed, and cloathed; and proper care and attention paid to the aged and infirm. Each time I was there, I was pleasingly struck with the cleanly appearance of all the inhabitants. Old and young, men and women, were spinning and carding wool, in rooms

GERMANY. 27

[Berlin Maison De Travail.]

about seventy-five feet by twenty-four.* All have clean linen once a week; and I observed a towel hanging up in each room. The apartments are all white-washed once a year: this gives freshness and neatness, and also light to the work-rooms. Here is a chapel with two galleries, one for each sex; and an apartment for the chaplain. The hall for meals is spacious: the hours, seven, twelve, and seven. I was present at dinner-time: after ringing a bell, in ten minutes all were seated at about twenty tables, eighteen to each table. Four separate tables were at a little distance for criminals. A servant having called out, silence, the school-master prayed at the desk, in the middle of the room. And after all had helped themselves with barley soup,† while they were eating, he read part of a chapter in the Bible; then sung an hymn, in which the children, who were all at one table, joined: after which, all went out and fetched their cans, each containing about a quart, and they were filled with small beer. After spending about half an hour at dinner, they had half an hour for recreation. The whole was conducted with the greatest regularity.

In this hall are morning prayers, at which all must attend clean, and then they take their bread for breakfast.

* My minuteness with respect to measurements and other circumstances relative to the construction and government of these buildings, will require no apology with those, who consider, that in the formation of new establishments it is of use to be acquainted with many things which, though apparently trivial, are frequently of material consequence to the purposes intended to be answered.

† I tasted the barley soup, the bread, and the beer, which were wholesome and good, and they had enough. They have butter or cheese, with their bread, for supper.

28 APPENDIX.

[Berlin Maison De Travail.]

This house resembles the old rasp or work-house at Amsterdam. It is exceedingly neat, and such great attention is paid to all confined in it, as prevents every ground of complaint. The strict and good police preserves the city of Berlin entirely free from beggars.*

[Spandau.]

At Spandau, about ten miles from Berlin, are two prisons. In that in the town, there were about a hundred and fifty persons, spinning, knitting, and carding wool. Forty-seven of these were men, committed for small offences. They have meat only on Sundays in this and some other houses of correction. Here were some rooms with silk-worms, on which the female prisoners attended. Neither this, nor any foreign houses of correction which I have seen, are without a chapel.

The other prison, in the fortress or castle, is surrounded with water. Thirty-six state prisoners were confined in it, and a hundred and five criminals. Some few of the latter were rasping logwood; the task for each thirty-six pounds a day: but most of them were spinning. The criminals are badly lodged, and there seems to be little attention paid to them. Here are none but men, for no women are ever permitted to continue a night in the castle. They had a light chain to each foot, and such as were taken after an escape had a collar of iron.

* That it is indeed strict and extensive I had some evidence by weighing the bread from various parts of the city; all which exactly agreed with the assize or standard. In June 1778, the fine white bread was something above three halfpence a pound; and there was just double the weight of rye bread for the same money.

GERMANY. 29

[Spandau.]

If I may judge, by what I saw of the state prisoners here, and at Magdeburg, and of the few prisoners in the spacious areas, all their apartments are not so dreadful as some imagine; nor are the persons confined in them unhealthy and miserable objects.*

[Lukau.]

The house of correction for Lusatia at Lukau is a spacious prison. The men were treading in a large wheel to grind corn, five and five by turns. Some of them had iron collars, as at Bern, but no irons on their feet. The prison for the women was a distinct building; their employment was spinning.

[Dresden.]

At Dresden, the apartments for the slaves being under the fortifications, must be unhealthy. I saw four sick, and yet they had their irons on. Among those that were at work, one had an iron collar, by way of punishment, for making an escape, besides the broad iron about his leg. Another was sitting, and endeavouring somewhat to alter the place of his iron. He told me, that the weight was marked on it twenty-one pounds, and that he could not have it changed to the other leg without paying a smith.

Here are two other prisons. The house of correction has ten or twelve rooms, each about ten feet square, with one window, and an aperture over the door, and barrack bedsteads. There were ten prisoners, five of each sex. Three of the men were rasping logwood in a room down twenty steps and the other two were employed as labourers

* They are not all confined to a small quantity of bread and water, in cells of four feet square and six feet high, and loaded with seventy-eight pounds of iron, as the ingenious and intrepid Trench was six years at Magdeburg.

[Dresden.]

in building a chapel. This prison and the orphan-house, is, very improperly, one building.

The other prison for the bailliage, contains nineteen chambers, in which were twenty-six prisoners; most of whom had a chain (some on one foot only, some on both) fastened to a staple in the wall. The prison was dirty; and the gaoler's pan of charcoal and frankincense (which his negligence rendered necessary) could not prevent its being very offensive. Here was one debtor, who had from his creditor six grosche (ten pence halfpenny) a day. The criminals allowance is one grosche (about seven farthings) each.*

[Prague.]

There was nothing very remarkable in the two prisons at Prague. The men at the Maison de Force, work out, with a guard, sawing wood, &c. for twelve creutzers† a day, which is less than the common wages of labourers. The prisoners themselves receive only four for a day's work, the rest is paid to the house. Many were thus employed, with chains to one or both legs, according to the different terms of their confinement.

* On paying my acknowledgments to the grand bailiff for permitting me to see the gaol, I took the liberty to observe, that I had seen prisons cleaner. I mentioned also the severity of chaining women, which is very uncommon in other countries. To this he answered, that "the gaoler chained them for security, being often obliged to be absent in fetching prisoners from the country." In return, I gave my opinion that the attention to a prison ought to be the sole work of a gaoler, without which, little regard will be paid to cleanliness or humanity.

† A creutzer is near a halfpenny.

GERMANY. 31

[Vienna.]

At Vienna I visited all the prisons, and most of the hospitals. The prisons are old buildings, and afford no instruction.

The front of the great prison. La Maison de Bourreau, is remarkable for a very striking representation of the crucifixion of our Saviour and the two thieves on mount Calvary. In this prison are many horrid dungeons.*

In the Maison de Force, or house of correction, were a hundred and sixty-nine men, and a hundred and forty women. The women were employed in carding, spinning, and knitting. I was present on a Monday morning, when they brought their week's work, for which,

* Here, as usual, I enquired whether they had any putrid fever, and was answered in the negative. But in one of the dark dungeons down twenty-four steps, I thought I had found a person with the gaol fever. He was loaded with heavy irons, and chained to the wall: anguish and misery appeared with clotted tears on his face. He was not capable of speaking to me; but on examining his breast and feet for petechiae or spots, and finding he had a strong intermitting pulse, I was convinced that he was not ill of that disorder. A prisoner in an opposite cell told me, that the poor creature had desired him to call out for assistance, and he had done it, but was not heard. This is one of the bad effects of dungeons.

I have been frequently asked what precautions I use, to preserve myself from infection in the prisons and hospitals which I visit. I here answer once for all, that next to the free goodness and mercy of the Author of my being, temperance and cleanliness are my preservatives. Trusting in Divine Providence, and believing myself in the way of my duty, I visit the most noxious cells, and while thus employed, "I fear no evil." - I never enter an hospital or prison before breakfast, and in an offensive room I seldom draw my breath deeply.

32 APPENDIX.

[Vienna House of Correction.]

after it had been weighed, they received their pay. They have all that they earn for themselves. A few received twenty-six creutzers each, others less. The master was employed in putting the name on the work of each prisoner, and setting down the money that was paid, and the cotton delivered. The prisoners saw the cotton weighed, and took as much as they could spin in that week.* At dinnertime, several large pans of soup and beer were brought in, and the prisoners bought what they thought proper.

The prison was too much crowded,† the house not being built for the purpose to which it is applied. In several rooms the men were carding and spinning. In one room, some of them, who were taylors, were making cloaths for the soldiers: in another, some were weaving coarse linen at eight looms: and in another room, they were making thick blankets for the convents. Two more rooms were warehouses for cloth, stockings, coverlids, &c. manufactured in the house for sale. They were then white-washing the house.‡

* In the holiday, when the prisoners are not permitted to work, each has an allowance of four or five creutzers.

† One or two of the women were crying, and charging others with rising in the night and stealing some of their cotton. The mistress believed the complaint, but said she was not able to prevent such frauds, because there was not the convenience of separate apartments.

‡ It is the general rule in Dutch and German houses of correction, to white-wash them once or twice a year. I seldom neglected to enquire about this practice, as we have a clause relative to it in a late act for preserving the health of prisoners in gaol.

GERMANY. 33

[Vienna.]

In the chapel is a proper separation of men and women. Here, and at Prague, and in some other parts of Germany, they have iron grate doors, which do not prevent the circulation of air, so salutary and necessary in houses of confinement. Too little attention is paid to the lodgings of the prisoners, for they have no coverlids.

Though I could not mention with commendation the prisons of this city, yet I must acknowledge, I was greatly pleased with the public buildings for the indigent, the aged, and infirm; which do honour to the citizens in general, and especially to the Empress Queen.

[Alms-house.]

The great alms-house* in the suburbs consists of three courts. The front of this spacious building is six hundred and thirty-seven feet; the aide, eleven hundred and fifty-three. The inhabitants are near three thousand, including the military invalids. It was agreeable to observe their order, neatness, and cleanliness. Here poverty and old age appeared with a smiling aspect. Many of them were seventy or eighty years of age. They were cheerfully spinning, because whatever they could gain was to be their own.

Les Freres de Charite have not only wards for the sick in their convent, but these friars have also another airy and commodious house with gardens, to which they remove their patients when they begin to recover. In this were two wards up stairs, and each ward has fourteen beds.

The noble Hospital for bringing up children, was the plan of one person, whom I left engaged in the improvement of his liberal design. In sixteen rooms for boys, were five hundred and thirty-nine beds, and two hundred and forty-one in eight rooms for girls. The extent of the front is six hundred and sixty-two feet.

34 APPENDIX.

[Vienna.]

In the great alms-house, and in several prisons and other public buildings, the rooms are all arched, to prevent danger and confusion in case of fire. Before I leave this city, I would just mention that every month, an account of the price, weight and measure of bread and flour, is put up on the gates.*

[Gratz.]

At Gratz (the capital of Stiria) I observed in the house of correction, that the prisoners had an appearance far more healthy than those I had seen in a similar house at Vienna. They have beds and coverlids, and the guards see that the men take off their cloaths at night.

[Laubach.]

I omit particulars concerning the prison at Laubach in Carniola, as I cannot say a word in favour of it.

[Trieste.]

At Trieste, the prison consists of eight or ten very close offensive rooms, each having only one small window. The pale countenances

* The bills I observed were dated July 1, 1778. Seven sorts of bread were mentioned in them. The finest was (by my weights) exactly one pound for three halfpence of our money. The second sort was one pound and six ounces for a penny. Inferior sorts made of rye were cheaper. I commonly examined the price, and the strictness of this part of the police, in most large cities that I visited, to compare them with our own at London.

The bakers at Vienna are punished for frauds by the severity and disgrace of the ducking-stool. This machine of terror, fixed on the side of the Danube, is a kind of long pole or board extending over the water, at one end of which the delinquent, being fastened in his basket, is immersed. The bakers would gladly purchase a removal of this machine, but the punishment is continued and inflicted by order of the magistrates.

GERMANY. 35

[Trieste.]

of the nineteen prisoners bespoke their own misery, and the negligence of the magistrates and keepers.

But in the Castle were eighty-five slaves (Condannati) who seemed healthy and well. They were confined for three, five, seven, or fourteen years and upwards; and were employed on the roads, in the harbour, &c. Some of them were at work in a large lighter,* clearing the harbour, just under my chamber window. To prevent their escaping, they were guarded by six soldiers. They did not work harder, than other labourers would in the same employment. Their hours for work were from five in the morning till between five and six in the afternoon; but they had two (from eleven to one) allowed them for rest, and half an hour more sometime before they left work. They appeared healthy, clean, and strong; and laboured cheerfully, because when they were employed, each of them received, as extraordinary pay, three farthings a day. Their common allowance was two pounds and a half of bread and four farthings a day. I heard them called over, and saw them receive their pay, before they entered their chambers in the castle. Their bread was sweet and good, such as I should have been happy to have found in many parts of my tour. They were treated with humanity, though

* Two wheels were fixed in the lighter, one of them to draw back the scoop or bucket, and the other (by the weight of ten men treading in it) to raise the mud, which was then emptied into another lighter managed by the overseer of the work. Three or four times a day, a soldier (with a bayonet fixed on his musket) accompanied a convict, who went to fetch a tub of fresh water, and on his return he supplied each with a tumbler of it while they were at work in the wheel. By the mast of the other lighter, a sail was spread to shade them, the weather being warm, Farenheit's thermometer 85°.

36 APPENDIX.

[Trieste.]

under strict discipline; were well supplied with food and cloaths; had two shirts, two pair of stockings, &c. and they lay in good beds* with coverlids, in large airy rooms having opposite windows, and not, like many convicts, in close dirty dungeons under the fortifications. But they were distinguished from other labourers by a light chain on their legs, and a chain supported by a girdle of leather at their waists.

ITALY.

I entered Italy with raised expectations of considerable information, from a careful attention to the prisons and hospitals, in a country abounding with charitable institutions and public edifices.

* May not one great cause of the unhealthiness of our prisoners be, the want of proper bedding, which obliges them to lie in their cloaths? How different did these prisoners appear at the castle from many that I have seen in Prussia and at Vienna! I was struck with the same good appearance of the women prisoners at several of the spin-houses in Holland. This reminds me of what I heard an old general say, "That he always found his men subject to illness and diseases when they lay in camps, not from dampness, but from lying in their cloaths and the want of proper bedding; for at the same time all his officers had been quite healthy and well." Whatever be the cause of this difference, whether a more free perspiration in bed, taking off bandages, or ventilation of the cloaths, I am fully convinced of the fact.

ITALY. 37

[Venice.]

At Venice, the great prison is near the Doge's palace,* and it is one of the strongest I ever saw. There were between three and four hundred prisoners, many of them confined in loathsome and dark cells for life; executions here being very rare. There was no fever, or prevailing disorder in this close prison. None of the prisoners had irons. On weighing the bread allowance, I found it fourteen ounces. I asked some who had been confined many years in dark cells, whether they should prefer the galleys? They all answered in the affirmative: so great a blessing is light and air! The chapel is only for the condemned, who continue there a night and a day before execution.

Regulations were hung up in the prison. - Here is a charitable society established for the relief of prisoners both civil and criminal, and rules are published for the direction of the officers who have the management of it, of whom four are appointed visitors of the prison. There are likewise rules for the good government of the two infirmaries. These I procured from the ducal printer, with the regulations for the galleys and prisons, for many years past.

One of the galleys was moored two boat's length from the shore, in which were only twenty-seven slaves, who were kept here in order to be sent on board the other galleys. This was clean. Here, and in the other galleys, which were dirty and crowded, the slaves were in chains of about twenty-seven pounds weight.†

* The rooms for the state prisoners are over part of the palace on the leads, which renders confinement in the heat of summer almost intolerable.

† I saw a slave dead on the shore, who I suppose destroyed himself in despair, for he could not hope to escape by swimming, because of his heavy irons.

38 APPENDIX.

[Padua.]

I visited the prisons of Padua and Ferrara: In the former of these cities, none of the confined debtors would sit on the elevated stone stool* in the great hall; and I was informed that not one had submitted to the ignominy these ten years.

[Bologna.]

At Bologna are three prisons; one of which is for debtors, who are alimented after four months and three days confinement, at one paule (about six pence) a day each.

[Hospital.]

The hospital, S. Maria de Vita, afforded me great pleasure. All was clean; and the wards were lofty, and not in the least offensive. The wards of the men and women were of the same size, each containing thirty-eight beds, nineteen on each side. The bedsteads were of iron, and the coverlids were white and clean. Each ward had fourteen windows, seven on a side, and all had curtains. They had folding wooden casements; and on the outside, wire lattices.†

* This is sometimes called the stone of disgrace; for if they who are insolvent would avoid imprisonment, at a time fixed they must sit upon it in a disgraceful manner three times.

† The wards of this hospital were thirty-two feet and a half wide, and the beds were three feet two inches wide, and three feet eight inches asunder. In the middle of each space of the wall between the beds was a cupboard, with a shelf, concealed by a small curtain; and over each curtain was a slip of black marble with the number of the bed. On the sides of all the wards, for the convenience of opening and shutting the windows, was a gallery eighteen feet above the floor, and two feet broad, with a light rail two feet nine inches high. The doors to the wards were iron grates, five feet five inches wide.

ITALY. 39

[Florence.]

In Florence are two prisons.* In the great prison, Palazzo Florence. degl' Otto, were only twenty prisoners. Six of them were in the secrete chambers, which are twenty-one strong rooms. None of the prisoners were in irons. They had mattresses to lie on. Their bread was good. In the torture chamber, there was a machine for decollation, which prevents that repetition of the stroke which too often happens when the axe is used.

In the other prison, Delle Stinche, there are five doors to pass before you come to the court. The opening of the first is three feet wide, and four feet nine inches high, with an inscription over it, Oportet misereri, (We ought to be compassionate.) In this prison are many spacious rooms, in which are small benches, or cribs to lie on. The men's rooms are below, and look into the court, which is about forty-three feet square. The women, entirely separated, are up stairs, and have an hospital joining to their room. A new infirmary for the men (forty-four feet by twenty-nine) is contiguous to the chapel. In this prison were forty-two men and fourteen women. Debtors are not separated from criminals. In one room were eight, who paid for their beds. The bread was good: the day's allowance to each fifteen ounces. None were in irons. - The chaplain has apartments, and resides in the gaol.†

* Dr. Targioni, who had an order from his royal highness to inspect the hospitals, and report what beneficial improvements might be made in them, accompanied me in visiting these prisons.

† This prison has something similar to the plan I proposed. A wall surrounds three sides of it; but being very high, and only eleven feet and a half distant, it renders the prison too close.

40 APPENDIX.

[Florence Hospitals.]

The great hospital of S. Maria Nova was crowded and too close; though the men's fever ward was four hundred and fifty-four feet long, and thirty feet and a half wide. They have separate wards for wounds and fractures. The women are attended by the Nuns, who have a passage under ground from the opposite convent. Here are twenty students, who lodge and board in the house for seven years, attend the sick, serve the victuals,* &c. and are distinguished by a long cloak.

But the hospital which I most frequently visited, was S. Giovan di Dio.† The ascent into the sick ward is by a flight of thirty stone steps. This ward was lofty and clean; and was a hundred and twenty-three feet long, and thirty-three and a half wide. There were in it thirty-three beds, three feet four inches wide, placed on varnished boards, on iron bedsteads.‡

Neither the sides nor floors of this, and the other hospitals of Italy, were wood, that being more retentive of scents or infection than tarras or brick. At one end there are five rooms with single beds for sick priests. Three of them were occupied.

The hospital S. Paolo della Convalescenza, for the reception of recovering patients, has clean and airy apartments, and a spacious

* I saw a friar or capuchin come in form and bless the meat or soup for dinner. The numerous patients seemed entirely satisfied with this, without any devotion of their own.

† The great attention of this order of friars to the sick, in every country where they have hospitals, does them honour.

‡ This is very conducive to cleanliness, and secures patients from vermin.

[Florence.]

refectory, or dining hall. They continue here four days, and by the change of air and diet their health is confirmed before they go to their several occupations.

Here I would just mention an alms-house, S. Bonifazio, for infirm persons of advanced age. It has eighty beds for each sex, and they are fitting up twenty more. The wards are (thirty feet wide) all clean, and shew the care of the Nuns who attend on this charity.*

[Leghorn.]

In the prison at Leghorn were three debtors, and eight of those called prisoners at large, and in the secrete three criminals. I mention this prison because of the infirmary, which, as appears by an inscription over the door, was built at the expense of the present governor, Philip Borbonio, in 1761.

[Fortress.]

The slaves in the fortress† appeared healthy and well; better, as the old keeper remarked, since they have lain on shore.‡ Each prisoner had a ring round one leg but when they go out to work, a chain is rivetted to two prisoners. Here were seven pontons to clear the harbour but the weather, when I was there, being stormy, they could not be worked. There were forty-seven slaves employed at

* I cannot leave Florence without expressing my great obligations to the Grand Duke for his permission to inspect the prisons, and making my acknowledgments to Sir Horace Mann our ambassador, for his very kind attention and assistance.

† In this fortress, there were a hundred and thirty-two slaves: at Pisa, were eighty-five: and at the Grand Duke's salt-works at Port Ferrara, seventy.

‡ Galleys or hulks ought to be the punishment only for the most atrocious crimes.

[Leghorn Fortress.]

the new Lazaretto, which is a noble spacious building, with different apartments for officers and their men to perform quarantine, and large warehouses for the cargoes of their ships.

The old keeper generously ordered his son to copy for me all the rules, from which I shall here give some extracts.

Three keepers have their salary from the Grand Duke. They receive a copy of the process against every convict, carry it to the government, and register it in the proper book; and when required, they must give an exact account of all proceedings against the prisoners. They make a report of the refractory to government, that they may be punished in proportion to their offences, with severer confinement, irons, and bastinadoes. The principal keeper has power to choose two turnkeys out of the best-behaved prisoners, who are to exhort and instruct the others: but the keeper is to have a strict watch over them. He must order that all prisoners, when they are brought in, have their heads shaved, - be dressed in the uniform of the house, - and have irons on their feet.

The prisoners are condemned to labour, for thirty, twenty, ten, or seven years, or for a shorter term, according to the nature of their crimes; and are chiefly employed on the publick works. They are sent out every morning, under a guard of soldiers, and are chained two and two together, with a chain of about eighteen pounds weight. An hour's relaxation is allowed them at breakfast, and two hours in the afternoon: and at an hour before sun-set, they are reconducted to the prison, and must be well searched by the keepers, to prevent their having any thing concealed: and two hours after sun-set, they are ordered to go quietly to rest. When they are employed on the

works by his royal highness, they are paid two crazzies (about three halfpence) a day; but if employed by other persons, they are paid four or six crazzies, according to the nature of the work. At day-break, the turnkeys ring the bell to awake them: and a report is made by them to the keepers, if any have been guilty of irregularities during the night. Their daily allowance is a loaf of thirty ounces (which is made two thirds of flour, and one third of bran,*) and soup made from four ounces of pease boiled in water, with salt and oil. On each of the two Easter holidays they are allowed a pound of meat, and three ounces of rice. Every two years they have a coat of gray cloth, a waistcoat of red cloth, and a red cap; every year a pair of shoes; and every six months a shirt, and a pair of drawers or breeches. Their drawers are shifted once a month, their shirts every week. For lodging, they have a mattress filled with straw, and a coverlid: the straw is changed, and kept in good order. - If one attempts to desert, and be taken before sun-set, he must wear a ring, and a chain of eighteen pounds weight; and he must pay half his future earnings, till it amounts to a zechin,† to those that apprehended him. If they who are condemned for five years desert, when retaken, their term again commences: and for repeated desertions, they are more severely punished, and sometimes tortured.

The chaplain must instruct the prisoners.

In the hospital there must be all proper provisions for the sick and infirm, viz. veal, mutton, rice, fine bread, broth, good wine, &c.

* Their bread was very good. I preferred it to that which I met with at my lodgings.

† A zechin is about 9s. 3d.

[Leghorn Fortress.]

A physician attends, and the diet and medicines must be according to his prescription. On entering, the patients have clean linen, shirts, night-caps, and cloaths. And the keepers and turnkey must examine their victuals and soup, to see that they be good, and that the quantity be according to the physician's orders.

[Rome.]

At the great prison at Rome, called the New Prison,* at the back of which runs the Tiber, on a stone tablet over the door, is this inscription:

secrete chambers, and twenty more at large. - There are eighteen of these strong rooms for the men, which are close and offensive, each of them having but one window for admitting light and air. These rooms are never opened without an order from the governor of the city. There were sixty-eight prisoners. They are not permitted to go out of their rooms at any time, but for examination. - Some having been confined there many years, appeared with pale sickly countenances, but none were in irons.

Here is a chamber for distracted prisoners, in which were several miserable objects.

There are several chambers with beds for those who are called prisoners at large, for which each pays one paule and a half (about eight pence) a night. There is a chamber for priests, one for boys, one for Jews, and one for prisoners who have cutaneous disorders.

On the upper floor are two Infirmaries: one, appropriated to the prisoners in the secrete, in which were four patients. In the other, which is for the rest of the prisoners, were ten patients the first time I was there, and the last time only seven.* The whole prison is arched with brick, for security in case of fire. The passages are seven feet two inches wide, and light. The ascent to each story, is by two flights of seventeen stone steps. These staircases are seven feet three inches wide; the rises five inches: this I mention, as generally, in our prisons (even those that are lately built) the stairs are

narrow, the rises high, and the passages dark and inconvenient. I wish I could say I had seen no torture chamber.*

In the prison at the Capitol are two rooms for poor debtors, and for criminals whose offences are not so great as to cause them to be confined in the secrete. The prisoners in one of these rooms, had the privilege of asking alms of the passengers. There were five debtors in rooms which they paid for, and two criminals in the secrete. This prison is not offensive. There is a constant current of water through one of the large rooms.

The state prisoners are confined in the castle of San Angelo. The rooms appropriated to that purpose were all empty, except one, in which was a bishop, who had been confined upwards of twenty years, and was distracted. Here were also eighteen condannati who work in the fortress, and had each a light chain. They seemed healthy and well.

On the death of the Pope, the prisoners are brought hither from the great prison, for upon such occasions the prisons are thoroughly cleaned.

I can give but little information respecting the prison of the inquisition. It is situated near the great church of St. Peter's. On one

* There is a table of regulations by the authority of the magistrates hung up in this prison, ordering the exact times, of opening the prison and the court of saying mass daily, and of distributing the alms. The times vary twice in a month, according to the different length of the days. In the same table, the physician is ordered to visit the sick in the infirmary every morning, and in case of extraordinary illness, in the evening.

side of the court round which it is built, is the inquisitor general's palace. Over the gate is an inscription importing "that it was erected by Pope Pius V. in the year 1569." The windows of the prison have wooden blinds, and at a small distance is a high wall.*

In this City, and many others in Italy, is a Confraternita della misericordia, called S. Giovanni di Fiorentini.† It consists of about seventy, chiefly nobles, of the best families. After a prisoner is condemned, one or two of them come to him the midnight before his execution, inform him of the sentence, and continue with him till his death. They, with the confessor, exhort and comfort him, and give him his choice of the most delicious food. All the fraternity attend the execution, dressed in white. When the prisoner is dead, they leave him hanging till the evening; then one of the fraternity, generally a prince, cuts him down, and orders him to be conveyed to the burying-place which they have appropriated to malefactors. I was there the twenty-ninth of August, the only day in the year when this burying-place is opened to the public. - Adjoining an elegant church is a chapel, which makes one side of a court, and on each of the other three sides, is a portico supported by Doric pillars.

* The chambers of this silent and melancholy abode were quite inaccessible to me; and yet I spent near two hours about the court and the priests apartments, till my continuance there began to raise suspicion.

† Many of Florentine extraction were the founders. This institution is ancient, for the church of S. Gio. Battijla Decollate belonged to them in 1450.

[Rome.]

In the middle of the pavement* of the front portico the women, and in one of the side porticos the men are buried. The latter are interred in the same dress in which they were hanged; for in Italy, coffins are not in general use.

[S. Michele.]

The hospital of S. Michele is a large and noble edifice. The back front is near three hundred yards long. It consists of several courts with buildings round them. In the apartments on three sides of one of the most spacious of these courts, are rooms for various manufactures and arts, in which boys who are orphans or destitute are educated and instructed. When I was there, the number was about two hundred, all learning different trades according to their different abilities and genius. Some were educated for printers, some for bookbinders, designers, smiths, carpenters, taylors, shoemakers, and barbers; and some for weavers and dyers, a cloth manufacture being carried on here in all its branches. When the boys arrive at the age of twenty years, they are compleatly clothed, and a certain sum is given to set them up in the business they have learned. In the middle of the court is a noble fountain, and there are several inscriptions to the honour of the founders of this excellent institution.

Joining to another court are apartments for the aged and infirm, in which were two hundred and sixty men, and two hundred and twenty-six women. Here they find a comfortable retreat, having

clean rooms and a refectory. I conversed with some of them, and they appeared happy and thankful.

Another part of this Hospital is a prison for boys or young men. Over the door is this Inscription:

Here were fifty boys spinning, and in the middle of the room* an inscription hung up,

SILENTIUM.

In this hospital is a room also for women. On the outside is an inscription, expressing, that it was erected by Clement XII. in 1735, for refraining the licentionjness and punishing the crimes of women.

There are in Rome many hospitals for the sick, but they were in general crowded, yet none of them had more than one patient in a bed. In the great hospital of San Spirito in Saffia,† there were, the first time I visited it, a thousand and fifteen patients; the second time, eleven hundred and three.‡

The hospital of S. Gio Laterano was also crowded and offensive; and that of S. Giacomo degl' Incurabili was worse:§ but that called

* This room being different from any I had before seen, I had a plan taken, which may give a clearer idea of it than a verbal description would do.

† Formerly many nations founded hospitals in this city. This was founded by one of our Saxon kings. Some others continue to the present time entirely national, as the Milanese, Florentine, and Spanish hospitals.

‡ Here is a staircase remarkable for its ascent being very easy, for valetudinarians, and for carrying up the sick in a kind of chairs or enclosed beds. It is seven feet wide, and has a rail on each side. Every step is an inclined plane of three inches ascent, one foot eight inches wide, and the rise from one step to another is only three inches. These steps are of bricks, set edgeways, and fronted with stone.

§ Indeed I saw the hospitals under great disadvantages, it being a very sickly time, occasioned by the long continuance of drought, and the extraordinary heats of the summer 1778.

[Plates.]

ITALY. 51

[Rome Hospitals.]

Benfratelli, that for the Florentines, that of S. Maria della Consolazione,* were clean, and perfectly free from any offensive scents. In this last mentioned hospital, no patients are received except such as have wounds or fractures. The Gallicano, another hospital in this City, is solely for cutaneous disorders.

Before we take our leave of Rome, it may be proper just to mention the Hospital for pilgrims and convalescents. Recovering patients, when dismissed from the other hospitals, may enter into this, and reside here three days, lodge in airy wards, dine in the refectory, and be well attended.

[Civita-vecchia.]

The Pope's galleys are at Civita-vecchia. The slaves condemned to them are confined for different terms, according to the nature of their crimes: but the shortest time is three years for vagabonds, who are generally employed on board the pontons in clearing the harbour. For theft, the term is never under seven years. Persons convicted of forgery are always confined for life; and if found guilty of forging bank-notes, or any instruments by which large sums have been lost, they are punished with an iron glove. Prisoners for life are chained two and two together: those for limited terms have all a single chain, and, at their first arrival, of the same weight; but when they have no more than one or two years to serve, they have only a ring

* At night, two chains are put across the street over-against this hospital, by an order of Pope Alexander VII. in 1661, for the purpose elegantly expressed in the inscription,

[Civita-vecchia.]

round their leg, which is lessened as the end of their term approaches. For escapes, they are obliged to finish their first condemnation, and then receive a fresh one for the same time as the former; but if the first was for life, the same is renewed, and they receive from a hundred to two hundred lashes a day, for three days after their arrival. None are sent to the galleys under the age of twenty: criminals of a younger age are kept at the hospital of S. Michele in Rome till they are of age; and are there employed in spinning, and fed on bread and water.

The allowance to each slave is three pounds of bread a day; and fifty-five pounds of beans or calavances to each galley, with which they generally make a kind of soup once in two or three days, and they are allowed two pound and a half of oil to boil with their beans. At Easter, Christmas, and Carnival, they are allowed one pound of beef and half a pint of wine a man, and twenty-five pounds of rice to a galley.

For their cloathing, they have once in two years, a striped woollen capotto and waistcoat, two shirts, two pair of canvass breeches, and a woollen cap; and every year, two feet and a half of woollen cloth to wrap round their legs instead of stockings.*

The slaves here are constantly employed, and have what they earn for themselves, being paid according to their abilities and the nature

* The yearly expense of each slave for maintenance, cloathing, and chains, is computed at fifteen Roman crowns and eighty-seven baiocs, about £3: 13: 9.

At the time of my being at Civita-vecchia, three of the galleys were out on a cruize, and two only remained. Through the whole night there was great silence, though about four hundred were chained in each of the galleys.

of their work. For sawing in the arsenal, they are paid two pence a day each; for working as masons, two pence halfpenny; for carrying stones and mortar, only a penny. Such as work at the canvass and callico manufactories are paid from two pence to eight pence, according to the quality of the work, &c. At the public works they are allowed an hour for dinner, and in summer-time an hour for breakfast.*

Here is a spacious hospital on shore for the slaves. None were in irons. All was clean. In the centre of the great room in this hospital was an altar for public worship. A particular room was appropriated for such as had cutaneous disorders, and another for consumptive patients.†

[Naples.]

The principal prison in the great and populous city of Naples‡ is La Vicaria, under the courts of justice. It contained when I was there, according to the gaoler's account, nine hundred and eighty prisoners. In about eight large rooms communicating with one another, there were five hundred and forty sickly objects, who had access to a

* For the preceding account I am indebted to our countryman Mr. Denham, who has the superintendence of the Pope's galleys.

† In this country, the physicians are persuaded that the consumption is a contagious disorder. Patients afflicted with it in hospitals have a separate ward. The same precautions are used to prevent infection as in the plague. When this disorder has been in private houses, the furniture is removed, and the rooms are scraped and fumigated, before they are again inhabited.

‡ An account is taken every year of the inhabitants of this city; and at Easter 1777, their number was 350,061; of whom 164,545 were males, and 160,071 females, besides 3303 priests, 4231 monks, and 6311 nuns.

[Naples.]

court surrounded by buildings so high as to prevent the circulation of air. In this court was a recess, under arcades like those under the chapel at Newgate. Some of the prisoners were employed in knitting, and others in making shoes, but most of them were entirely without employment. In six chambers, which opened into a spacious hall, were many beds for such as could pay for them. Adjoining was a chapel, and an airy infirmary for the whole prison.* In seven close offensive rooms were thirty-one prisoners, almost without cloaths on account of the great heat: and in six dirty rooms communicating with one another were fifty women. Of all the prisoners, one man only was in irons, in a dungeon, near a small chapel which is allotted to the condemned before execution.

The bread was good: the daily allowance to each was twenty-two ounces.

There were three other prisons: one contained eighty prisoners, another near sixty, the other but eleven.

[Galleys.]

The galleys were moored about ten feet from the shore. In the first were two hundred and sixty slaves; in the second, two hundred and ninety-eight; in the third, two hundred and seventy; and in the fourth, four hundred, most of them stout and healthy. All were chained two and two together. Their bread was hard, but sweet.

* There were forty persons in this infirmary, in single beds, with sheets, coverlids, &c.

In visiting the prisons of Italy, I observed, that in general great attention was paid to the sick; but I could not avoid remarking, that too little care was taken to prevent sickness.

From the heat of the climate, one might imagine the gaol fever would be very likely to prevail; but I did not find it in any of the prisons.

ITALY. 55

[Naples.]

About twenty-six ounces a day was allowed them; and when employed in the arsenal and other public works, they have an extraordinary allowance of near a penny a day. After escapes, if they are retaken, their whole term is doubled. Each galley has a chaplain, and public worship on Sundays and Holidays.

In the Serraglio, or great alms-house,* there were about five hundred and fifty prisoners condannati in eight or nine rooms. Many of them work as labourers on this great building, with chains varying according to the terms of their confinement; and have the extra allowance just mentioned, with five ounces of flour for soup. In these rooms were shoemakers at work, as in some of the galleys; but most of the prisoners had no employment.†

This great building is to be a receptacle for the aged and infirm; and for beggars and idle persons. There is a great number of the former in some rooms that are finished, and which have windows into a court, where they were digging a foundation for a very large church, by which the numerous inhabitants will be deprived of the salutary effects of the circulation of air.

The galley slaves have an hospital on the shore‡ fronting the bay, entirely appropriated to them and their guards. It has four or five

spacious and airy wards, cleaner than most of the other hospitals in this city. One of these rooms is only for the guard of the marine. The patients are distinguished into three classes; sick - very ill - and recovering. Great attention is paid to them: and they are allowed good bread in sufficient quantity.

[Hospitals.]

The great and crowded hospitals of S. Apoatoli and L'Annunziazione, have wards appropriated to the cure of wounded persons.*

The hospital of the Benfratelli, or S. Gio. di Dio, is clean and elegant. It consists chiefly of one lofty ward,† at one end of which is an altar and a room for poor priests, and at the other end a table on which were placed the patients victuals. Near this table was inscribed a reference to the apposite words of Scripture, Matthew xxv. 35, 36. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: &c.

* The frequency of assaults and assassinations in Italy is generally known. Many of the common people seem to be insensible of the atrociousness of the crime of murder. I have heard criminals in prison express, with seeming satisfaction of mind, "that though they stabbed, they did not rob." If we consider that wards and even hospitals appropriated to the wounded are filled with patients, that the prisons are crowded, and that many are continually taking refuge on the steps of churches, and examine our accounts in Janssen's Lists and the Judges' Returns, we may reckon that there are more murders committed in a year in the city of Naples or Rome, than in Great Britain and Ireland. Does not this prove that the English are not naturally cruel? And might not arguments be derived from hence, for the revisal and repeal of some of our sanguinary laws? The Marquis Beccaria justly remarks, in his Essay on Crimes and Punishments, chap. 2S. "That the punishment of death is pernicious to society, from the example of barbarity it affords."

† In many of the Italian hospitals, and in all that I have seen belonging to this order of friars, there are no rooms over the sick wards, so that they are as lofty as our churches or chapels.

ITALY. 57

[Lucca.]

At Lucca, they formerly sold their condannati to the Genoese or Venetians, but now they keep them in prison without any employment.

[Genoa.]

At Genoa, besides a prison for debtors, and a prison hr female criminals, there is a great prison for male criminals, consisting of thirty-five rooms. I saw none of the prisoners in irons. Their daily allowance was thirteen ounces of good wheaten bread for each. To this prison belongs an hospital and a chapel, with a large room to which the condemned are brought four days before their execution. - The instructions formed for this prison by the supreme syndics, are hung up in it, and contain good regulations, as will appear from the following account of a few of them.

The keeper shall have under him six assistants: - and the said keeper is to be responsible, and liable to punishment, if any of the assistants shall be guilty of the least fraud or neglect in their employment. - The advocate fiscal is once a week, at any time he shall think proper (but when he is least expected) to visit the cells of the prison, and to enquire diligently how the prisoners are treated by the keeper and assistants, in order to give information to the most serene senate, &c. - When any prisoner is condemned to death, he is immediately to be put into chains. - The keeper is always to keep the chapel shut, except at the time of celebrating mass, confession, or administering consolation to the unhappy. - He is also to take care that the prisoners do not play at any games, particularly cards. The last order is, that this table of regulations be fixed up in the criminal court of justice, in the chancery, and in the apartments of the criminals.

[Galleys.]

In one of the galleys just returned from conveying some noblemen to their country seats, I found about three hundred stout fellows,

58 APPENDIX.

[Genoa Galleys.]

clean and healthy: for the old and infirm had been left in the galleys at home, of which there were only two, the other two being out on a cruize.

That five superintendents shall be appointed by the magistrates, who every month shall draw lots, to determine which of the galleys they are to inspect. - That exact lists of the crews, and of the sick in the infirmary, with an account of the time of their admission, shall be taken and kept, with the assistance of the physician, chaplain, and surgeon. - That the secretary shall keep a register of all things necessary to be provided; bread, wine, meat, pease, beans, rice, &c. &c. - That four caldrons of broth shall be allowed weekly to a galley, besides kettles of broth statedly given them in the three winter months. - That when the superintendents discontinue the allowance of meat, cheese, oil, and stockfish, the chaplain shall see that each of the slaves be served daily with half a pint of wine. - That the physicians shall keep exact accounts of their orders of meat, wine, pastry, &c. - That the captains and midshipmen shall take care that all the regulations be exactly observed.

[Hospital.]

In the great hospital there were about three hundred men and six hundred women. All sick persons of any nation are admitted into it; and it is one of the best and least offensive of the public hospitals of Italy. Here was a room and ward for foundlings, crowded and close; and the poor infants were cruelly bound hands and feet with bandages.

ITALY. 59

[Genoa Hospitals.]

There were also in this hospital apartments for the insane. These apartments were close and dirty; and the calm and quiet, I found inhumanly confined in the same room with the noisy and turbulent.

The Albergo hospital, situated on an eminence within sight of the harbour, is an asylum for boys and girls. There were in it a hundred and seventeen of the former, and four hundred and eighty-two of the latter. It is something similar to the noble and well-regulated hospital of San Michele at Rome. Over the door of the great room, where numbers were spinning and weaving, is this inscription:

Silentium et Obedientia.

[Milan.]

In Milan, besides the great prison in which are twenty secrete chambers;* - the prison for debtors,† &c. - there are two prisons called L'Argastro, and La Casa di Correzione, which do honour to the country. Both are for criminals, condemned either for a term of years, or for life. The most atrocious, work in chains in the streets; the others only in the house.

* The general size of these rooms is eleven feet by twelve to fifteen. In some were only one or two persons, but in others six or eight: the windows are towards a high wall eleven feet distant. These are some of the strongest and most retired rooms in the Italian prisons, which the most atrocious offenders, and those who are imprisoned for life, are confined. They are inaccessible but by a special order. The entrance is guarded by two doors, between which is a narrow space, just sufficient to admit two persons. Into this you are locked before the turnkey opens the inner door, for fear these desperate criminals should attempt to rush out and murder the keeper for the keys.

† In this great trading city, there were only four persons confined for debt.

60 APPENDIX.

[Milan House of Correction.]

In L'Argastro there were three hundred and fifty-nine prisoners, healthy and strong. A considerable number of them were at work in public:* but in the house there were at work shoe-makers, taylors, smiths, wheelwrights, cabinet-makers, turners, nailers, rope-makers, leather-dressers, painters on gauze, spinners and weavers. In one room eleven looms were employed.†

Their dormitory is a spacious room, with three stages in it on which they lie. In the centre of the cieling are four large apertures and sixteen small ones.‡

There is a large court and a pump, and running water for washing§ the linen of the prisoners, which they shift once a week. The daily allowance to each is thirty-five ounces of good bread,‖ and a mess of good vegetable soup. They have two hours for dinner and repose.

* They water the streets and public walks (at the expense of the city) there being nineteen small four-wheeled waggons for that purpose; six men draw, and one attends behind chained. Others repair the pavements, &c.

† Many learn several trades; so that there is a probability, that when their term is finished, they will become useful members of society; which should be the grand object in all such houses. They receive for themselves one third of what they earn, and two thirds go to the house.

‡ A prisoner, whose employment was drawing designs and patterns, gave me a plan of the rooms and courts in this prison.

§ I observed to one of the prisoners that they were cleaner than most working men: he replied, "or else the confinement would be intolerable."

‖ One loaf was equal to the daily allowance of two prisoners, and it was divided into two equal parts with an engine, and each received his own portion every day.

In this house there is an hospital, a chapel, and an apartment for the chaplain.

[House of Correction.]

The Caja di Correzione is now building, on a noble and spacious plan.* The dormitory and the work-rooms for the men are finished and occupied.† In one of these work-rooms there were forty looms employed weaving linen, cotton, and diaper: in which also, and in two others opening into it, were warping and twisting-mills, and winding-wheels. Under these was a calendar: and some were employed in beating (not carding) cotton. In a detached temporary building I saw a prisoner employed in weaving gauze; who (as I conjectured from the great resort to him) was reckoned curious in this art. With the assistance of some whom he employed, he kept four looms at work. Other prisoners were bleaching the cloth manufactured in the house. And some were employed as labourers and masons in this great building.

Over the work-rooms is the great hall or dormitory, the room for boys, and the infirmary. The dormitory is lightsome, airy and clean, and appears evidently to be an improvement on that of San Michele at

* The Count de Firmian, governor of Lombardy, whose amiable character is well known to our English travellers, not only honoured me with the plan, but favoured me with every advantage for examining the prisons.

† The two work-rooms for the women, (just finished) are large and lofty, and in each there are five large windows, placed high above the floor. At one corner of these rooms are stone basons, with water laid in to them.

Rome.* It consists of a great room, (one hundred and twenty-four feet by thirty-one)† near the end of which there is an altar with a cupola over it: on one side of the altar is the dormitory for boys, and on the other the infirmary; and all together make the figure of a cross, which is the form of many hospitals in Italy and other Roman Catholic countries.

There were near three hundred prisoners in this house; twenty of whom were chained to two benches in the dormitory, but at the same time employed in spinning, making and mending clothes. There are two or three rooms, adjoining those in which they work, occupied as warehouses. All the prisoners work in irons.

[Hospital.]

In visiting the great hospital, my expectations, which had been too much raised by the accounts of travellers, were disappointed. Most of the wards are on the ground floor and not lofty, as there are rooms over them. They are also dirty and offensive, though provided with spacious drains. They have a middle row of beds, and in many of the beds were two persons: but care was taken to separate the patients in fevers from those who were attended by surgeons.‡

* I therefore insert the plan of this also.

† On each side of the hall are three stone galleries, two feet eight inches wide, with iron rails. The chambers are all numbered, amounting to one hundred and twenty: these are all similar, nine feet two inches by eight feet two; they have one window outward, three feet by two: and one towards the great room, two feet five inches by one foot five: they are furnished with a bed and bedding, a stool, and a vault. In the infirmary, and the dormitory for boys, as well as in the great hall, there were stone sinks and water laid in.

‡ Most of the chirurgical patients had been wounded in sudden quarrels or assaults.

ITALY. 63

[Milan Hospitals.]

The hospital of S. Gio di Dio exhibits that cleanliness and attention, which this fraternity always discovers.

In the hospital for orphans called La Stella, the work and bed rooms were spacious, neat and agreeable. There were three hundred girls in it; whose employment was making lace on round pillows.*

[Turin Citadel.]

In the prison at the Citadel of Turin there, were one hundred and seventy in irons some had the half-chain, others were chained two and two together. These prisoners continue always unemployed, till they are sent to the galleys at Villa-Franca. Their unhealthy countenances plainly shewed the little attention paid to them. - In this prison there was a chamber for convalescents, who not being fit for labour, are continued here forty days before they are sent to the galleys.

[Hospitals.]

In the great hospital of San. Giovanni there were a multitude of old men and women, whose apartments had a very improper communication with the wards of the sick and dying.

In the hospital of La Carita, there were about two thousand inhabitants, mostly boys and girls.

Here also is an hospital for lunaticks, where with pain, I saw wards crowded with beds, and in some of them miserable creatures chained and raving.

[Chamberry.]

At Chamberry I found that the salutary practice of washing the prison was adopted. Besides the stated -allowance of good bread, the

* I wished them a more healthy employment, and that they had used the square pillows of Flanders; for constantly stooping must be prejudicial. Such as are thus employed are generally of a pale and sickly complexion.

[Turin.]

prisoners are often supplied with bread and soup, and in winter with clothes and coverlids, by a charitable society of ladies. In one of the rooms I saw chains; but was told they had not been used since the walls had been built high. A dismal torture chamber, into which day-light never enters, makes a part of this prison.

[Geneva.]

At Geneva I revisited the prison which was formerly the bishop's palace. There were in it two debtors, and five other prisoners; to whom great attention was paid, as they were then laying new floors, lest the rooms should be damp and injurious to their health.*

In the house of correction there were no prisoners.

SWITZERLAND.

In entering Switzerland from Geneva, a traveller will be suprised to meet frequently with a gibbet on the road, if he be not informed that almost every seigneurie or bailiwick has a prison, and possesses the power of trying criminals and capitally convicting them. I visited one of these prisons. It belonged to Mr. Baron de Prangins,

* I hoped to have found here no torture chambers, but I had only the pleasure to hear that none had suffered in them these twenty five years. They are thus restrained by the thirty second article in the Reglement de l'illustre Mediation pour la pacification des troubles de la Republique de Geneve, published in 1738, "Les accuses et criminels ne pourront être appliqués a la Question ou Torture, que préalablement ils n'ayent été par jugement definitif, condamnés a mort."

and consisted of four rooms at the top of his castle.* It was empty: and this is commonly the case with the prisons in this country, in consequence of the virtuous education and industry of the inhabitants.

[Freyburg.]

At Freyburg there were no prisoners except a few in the house of correction. The men convicts are employed abroad in cleaning the streets, &c.

There were none confined in all the prisons at Bern, except in the two houses of correction. In that for the city, the men and women were spinning. In the other, called the Scallenhaus, there were a hundred men and forty-one women, who were in separate apartments, and three different rooms assigned to each sex according to their different crimes and the terms for which they were condemned.† They were all employed either in the house or abroad, except fifteen, who seemed miserable for want of employment.‡

* I observed the same thing at the castle in the isle of Gorgona in Italy, where were two rooms at the top of the building for prisons. This is different from the ancient cruel mode of confining prisoners in pits and dungeons of castles.

† An old keeper having left the door of one of the men's wards unlocked, twelve prisoners forced the outer door and walked off. The people, who happened to see them, suffering them to pass, because they supposed they were going to work in the streets. When four or five of them some time after were retaken and carried to their old lodgings, the magistrates ordered that they should not be punished, considering that every one must be desirous of gaining liberty. As they had not been guilty of assault or violence in making their escape, the punishment fell on the keeper for his negligence.

‡ Where the crimes are of such a nature as to allow or require indulgence, it should be given them by shortening their term of confinement, or in some other way, instead of allowing them to be idle. I have seen this false indulgence to prisoners in several places.

66 APPENDIX.

[Bern House of Correction.]

Some of the women were employed in spinning. I saw them bring in their week's work, and after it was examined, receive twenty-seven pounds of flax for the following week. At that time some of the town's people came and purchased the flax that had been spun, and paid for it to an inspector who lives near the prison.

As the employment of the male convicts out of doors is here somewhat similar to that at Milan, I give a representation of it from a draught taken by a painter in this city; I have also given a view of the employment of the women, though I detest the custom of daily exposing that sex to such ignominy and severity, unless when they are totally abandoned, and have lost all the foster feelings of their sex.*

[Zurich.]

At Zurich there is a prison, situated in the middle of the river, for capital crimes,† and a house of correction. In the latter, which is convenient and spacious, there were about sixty prisoners. Nineteen

* Will it need an apology if the mode of publishing the assize of bread in this City be just mentioned? It is better than that at Vienna and several other cities. In the middle of the window of every baker's shop is hung up in full view, the bill on pasteboard, specifying the weight and price of three different sorts of bread, and, at the bottom, that of the fine rolls. The bills are signed by the magistrates' secretary. If the price continues the same the following month, the secretary notes it on all the bills. I copied one of these bills, and purchased the different sorts of bread, which I found to be full, or rather over weight.

† Here was only one prisoner. The first room was for examination; in it were five different weights for torture, and if we may depend on tradition, the heaviest, which is one hundred and twenty pounds, was used in torturing a burgomaster of this city.

of the men worked abroad for the citizens, who paid them for their work, but not so much as other labourers. The rest were spinning within doors or working at some trade. I observed one woman colouring botanical prints. They have a chapel in which they attend divine service, and are catechised every friday. Three times a day, such of them as do not work abroad walk under arcades in a large square court, during which time, by the advice of one of the physicians in this city, their rooms are thoroughly aired, the doors and windows being thrown open. They have good bedding; and they are well supplied with bread and soup every day, but no meat.

The prisoners on entrance have the house clothes, and their own are hung up, with their names, and the time of their commitment, noted upon them.

[Schaffhausen.]

There were no prisoners at Schaffhausen, except three in the house of correction.

From Switzerland I returned into Germany, to visit some prisons which I had not seen, particularly those in the free or imperial Cities.

GERMANY.

[Augsburg.]

AT Augsburg, the prison is on the side of a hill, at the back of the town-house. It consists of many cachots or small rooms on three different floors. There is one for examination, and there are two for the

68 APPENDIX.

[Augsburg.]

engines of torture.* The condemned are brought three days before their execution into two light rooms, which open into a Roman catholic chapel: where, however, if a prisoner be a protestant, a Lutheran minister is permitted to attend him.

The House of Correction consists of buildings on two sides of a spacious court; one side for those of the Roman catholic religion, and the other for Protestants, with a chapel for each. The rooms were all clean, and are white-washed every year. Opposite to the front windows in most of the rooms, were high windows, of a semi-circular form, which were designed for promoting a circulation of air.

[Munich.]

At Munich or Munchen there are two prisons for criminals. One in the town-house had in it six men and two women prisoners.† In a dark damp dungeon down seventeen steps were the instruments of torture.

The other, called La Prison de la Cour, consisted of about fifteen cells, twelve feet by seven, and a black torture-room.‡

* There are a!so two dark dungeons for such as have been convicted of witchcraft: but they are in a very ruinous condition, and seem to have been a long time without inhabitants.

† Once a year, viz. on All-saints day, any persons are permitted to enter and see the prison. There is a custom similar to this in Holland, at the Fair and other fixed times.

‡ In this room there is a table covered with black cloth and fringe. Six chairs for the magistrates and secretaries covered also with black cloth, are elevated two steps

GERMANY. 69

[Munich.]

In the house of correction were about forty men and thirty women some weaving wide cloth, but most of them spinning. The keeper ordered his servant to attend me with charcoal and frankincense; a certain sign of negligence and inattention, which the countenances of the prisoners confirmed.

[Hospitals.]

I was agreeably relieved from the pain excited by these scenes, with the view of the two hospitals of Les Freres and Les Soeurs de Charité. In the former were about forty beds; in the latter, twenty: the wards were about twenty-six feet wide. All was neat and clean, still and quiet; and the great attention paid to the patients was every where apparent. I saw the operation of bleeding performed by the nuns with great dexterity and tenderness. Over the foot of each bed a text of scripture was inscribed, as in some Italian hospitals.

[Ratisbon.]

The prison at Ratisbon or Regensburg is in the town-house. Many of the chambers are airy, and most of them have stoves. There are

above the floor and painted black. Various engines of torture, some of which are stained with blood, hang round the room. When the criminals suffer, the candles are lighted; for the windows are shut close, to prevent their cries being heard abroad. Two crucifixes are presented to the view of the unhappy objects. But it is too shocking to relate their different modes of cruelty. Even women are not spared. - This room seems very much like the torture-room in Spain, described in Limbarch's History of the Inquisition translated by Chandler, vol. II. p. 221, 4to. edit. "It was a large underground room, arched, and the walls covered with black hangings. The candlesticks were fastened to the wall, and the whole room enlightned with candles placed in them. - The inquisitor and notary sat at a table, so that the place seemed as the very mansion of death, every thing appearing so terrible and awful."

70 APPENDIX.

[Ratisbon.]

no dungeons, but three dark cellars for torture, at which two senators, their secretary, and the hangman with his valets assist. At Munich and some other places, a surgeon also attends; but I heard of no such custom here.

At the back of the orphan-house is the house of correction, in which were only two women.

[Nurenburg.]

At Nurenburg the prison is under the tower-house. There are fifteen steps down to the goaler's kitchen. The apertures for admitting light into the passages of the dungeons are level with the ground. This is one of the worst prisons I ever saw. The dark unhealthy dungeons, and the dismal torture-chamber,* do no honour to the magistracy of this city. - The goaler makes use of a low trick to prevent the escape of his prisoners, by terrifying them with the apprehensions of falling under the power of witches.†

In one of the city-towers in which lunatics are confined, there are three or four rooms for criminals of higher rank.

* In this chamber on the wall is inscribed a gingling verse, which I here insert, as perhaps no traveller but myself has ever seen it:

Ad mala patrata, sunt atra theatra par ata. 1753.

† In several of the German gaols there are dungeons for those that are guilty of witchcraft, but they seem to have been long disused: and I hope increasing light and good sense will soon intirely banish the fears of witches, and consequently the witches themselves.

GERMANY. 71

[Nurenburg.]

The prisoners in the house of correction* were employed in grinding spectacle-glasses. The surplus of what they earn above forty creutzers or eighteen pence a week each, they are allowed for themselves.† Some of the women were working gold and silver lace on cushions.

[Schwabach.]

At Schwabach, in the margraviate of Anspach, is a large house of correction, in which were ninety-three prisoners. Some men here also were grinding glasses in two large rooms, and others, in different apartments, were employed in polishing steel buttons for clothes, wiredrawing, and making spinning wheels: and I was informed that twelve were at work on the road. The women were spinning.

This house was clean and well regulated. The goaler readily supplied me with a book containing an account of the regulations, &c.; in which are some liberal and sensible remarks that appear worth transcribing.

* Over the gate of the house is this inscription:

Hie criminum frequentia

Mortalium dementia

Compeseitur dementia

Salva fori sententia.

† The men grind seven glasses in each hand. Some grind four hundred in a week, by which they earn fifty-two creutzers at thirteen for a hundred, and consequently each earns for himself twelve creutzers a week.

That this is a very unhealthy business is evident from the countenances of those whom I saw thus employed, and from the disagreeable sensations I always received from the dust in the rooms where they were grinding. The medical gentlemen prescribe bleeding and physick to these persons, two or three times a year.

72 APPENDIX.

[Schwabach House of Correction.]

It is observed, "that there is great error in expecting that a house of this kind should be able to maintain itself; since with the strictest oeconomy, a considerable annual sum will be found necessary for its proper support."

The greatest attention to cleanliness is inculcated; bathing rooms are provided for the prisoners; and the expense of washing for them is reckoned an object not to be regarded.

The necessity for sick wards for both sexes is pointed out.

It is remarked, "to be a very false notion, that a man who lives upon bread and water can work hard and be kept in health;" accordingly, as will be seen in the table subjoined, a daily allowance of hot provisions is ordered for the criminals.

It is mentioned as an essential point in order to preserve order and prevent abuses, "that one of the city magistrates should every week in rotation visit the house, and closely inspect every thing relative to its management."

Such prisoners as have been publickly whipped are called infames, and are distinguished from the rest, by having a particular place appropriated to them in the chapel, and by being made the last in receiving the sacrament. The chaplain resides in the house. The account of the daily allowance* to the prisoners was hung up in the dining room.

* Regulations of the daily hot provisions for those prisoners who are set to hard labour in the house of correction who are set to hard labour.

And in the evening, a pint of soup with eight ounces of bread.

In the winter months, half a pound of meat with a pint of sour krout.

And in the evening, a pint of soup with eight ounces of bread.

[Bayreuth.]

In a large house of correction near Bayreuth, in Franconia, the men were all working on marble,* which is found in the neighbouring mountains.† Many were employed at the polishing bench, two on each slab. Others were variously engaged, in finishing, filing, or

carving; or in cutting proofs or samples at the wheels; or in working on tobacco-boxes, snuff-boxes, &c. A large warehouse contained the goods they had finished. In summer, many of them are employed in sawing without doors; but in winter, they work in rooms: for were they to attempt this work abroad, a sudden frost might endanger the materials, but would certainly render it impossible to use the saw. The pale countenances of the prisoners were a sign that their work was laborious, and that the keeper had the whole profit.

The women were spinning worsted, and appeared objects of compassion. Their dirty rooms, sickly looks, and cutaneous complaints, evidently bespoke inattention and neglect.*

[Wurtsburg.]

In the house of correction at Wurtsburg were fifty-four men and thirty-six women, employed in a well-regulated woollen manufactory. In one part of the house they were spinning; in another, picking and carding wool; and in another, weaving wide cloth for the soldiers,† and also docking and waistcoat-pieces. - The women were all spinning or carding in one large room. As their spinning was of various kinds.

* I have their book of regulations: but of what advantage are the best rules when not enforced

† The wheels were larger than our spinning-wheels, the diameter being four feet.

Here, and at most houses of this sort, are large looms (six feet seven inches wide) and two persons work at each loom. In a warehouse, the manufacturer (for all such houses have a manufacturer) shewed me several pieces of cloth for the under officers, the artillery, the soldiers, and the hospital or poor-house.

GERMANY. 75

[Wurtsburg.]

there was a room with cupboards, where each person's work was laid up separately. The task for each man or woman was eight creutzers, or three pence half-peny, a day. Here is a Roman catholic chapel, and the priest lives in the house.*

[Francfort.]

At Francfort (on the Maine) there are five prisons. One is for debtors, where I found only three, who were alimented at ten creutzers, about four pence, a day, payable by their creditors.

The prison called La Tour de Ste. Catharine was empty. Here is a light room, to which criminals are generally brought from the great guard prison, just before their execution. The men are hanged, and the women beheaded; but executions are very rare in this city.

In the house of correction (near the work-house) were three prisoners, two women and a man. The man was at work with two or three others in the court, beating to powder a porous stone, which is worked up with water, and makes, when dry, a hard cement or coat of plaster. The two women were employed in the work-house.

[Cologn.]

In the tower at Cologn there were no prisoners either for debt or for capital offences. In this and many other cities, the magistrates will not permit a debtor who has no effects to be confined. This city has not the power of executing criminals, but when they are condemned they are delivered up to an high officer of the elector's, and confined in a

dungeon in his house. 1 saw one thus confined when I was here three years ago.

In the house of correction, the men were beating stone to powder with small wooden mallets, as is practised at Francfort. - The women were spinning, or knitting stockings.

[Aix-la-Chapelle.]

The great prison at Aix-la-Chapelle was unoccupied.

In the guard prison near the Maison de Ville there were two prisoners; one of whom was a very old man with irons on his hand, who was confined on suspicion, and had twice suffered the torture to force a discovery of his confederates.

Executions are not frequent in this city.* Citizens are always executed by decollation, which is performed by the broad sword, as at Hamburgh, Bern, &c. and not by a machine, as in some parts of Italy; nor by the axe, as in England, Denmark, &c.

[Liege.]

The two prisons (distinguished by the names of the old and the new) near La Porte de St. Leonard in Liege, are on the ramparts. - In two rooms of the old prison I saw six cages made very strong with iron,f four of which were empty. These were dismal places of confinement i but I soon found worse. In descending deep below ground from the gaoler's apartments, I heard the moans of the miserable

* In this and many other cities, the convict knows not of his execution, till three days before the time. Then he is constantly attended by his confessor, and indulged in the choice of food.

[Liege.]

wretches in the dark dungeons. The sides and roof were all stone. In wet weather, water from the fosse gets into them, and has greatly damaged the floors. Each of them had two small apertures, one for admitting air, and the other, with a shutter over it strongly bolted, for putting in food for the prisoners. One dungeon larger than the rest was appropriated to the sick. In looking into this, with a candle, I discovered a chimney, and felt some surprize at this little escape of humanity from the men who constructed these cells.

The dungeons in the new prison are abodes of misery still more shocking; and confinement in them so overpowers human nature, as sometimes irrecoverably to take away the senses. I heard the cries of the distracted as I went down to them. One woman, however, I saw, who (as I was told) had sustained this horrid confinement forty-seven years without becoming distracted.

The cries of the sufferers in the torture-chamber may be heard by passengers without, and guards are placed to prevent them from stopping and listening. A physician and surgeon always attend when the torture is applied; and on a signal given by a bell, the gaoler brings in wine, vinegar and water, to prevent the sufferers from expiring. - "The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel." Thus in the Spanish inquisition, the physician and surgeon attend to determine the utmost extremity of suffering without expiring under the torture.*

I will only add, that in this prison there are rooms appropriated to prisoners en pension; that is, to such as are confined by the magistrates,

* See Chandler's Translation of Limborch's Hist. of the Inquisition, vol. II. p. 222.

[Liege.]

at the desire of their parents, guardians or relations. A shocking practice! which prevails also in some of the neighbouring countries.

In the Maison de Force there were ninety prisoners, ranged in four rooms, and employed in a woollen manufactory of linings for soldiers clothes. Persons live in the house who well understand the business, and instruct the prisoners in sorting, carding, spinning, twisting and weaving. None of them were in irons. All had separate beds, and were supplied with good rye bread, - meat three times a week, - two quarts of beer, for each, every day, - and soup every other day.*

FLANDERS.

[Brussels.]

At Brussels I revisited the prison La Porte de Halle, which consists of twenty-four chambers, distinguished by the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, and each prisoner had a separate room.

The house of correction is an old building, and the prisoners are soon to be removed to that at Vilforde. They are all employed; for at

* The chaplain, who lives in the house, favoured me with his company through the work-rooms, lodging-rooms, and the refectory. He entered into the true spirit of this institution, and lamented the inconvenience of the house, as not being built for the purpose to which it is applied. He took notice of the propriety of solitary confinement for those that were riotous and refractory at their first coming; for generally, he said, "in four or five days they would become very tractable and submissive."

FLANDERS. 79

[Brussels.]

present they have a careful and attentive keeper. Some tailors and shoe-makers were at work; but most of the men were occupied in the manufacture of paper-hangings; carving the moulds, grinding the colours, and staining the paper. The women prisoners were entirely separated from the men, and were employed in making lace. All the prisoners have clean linen every week.

[Ghent.]

At Ghent I went over the house of correction, or La Maison de Force, with one of the magistrates, and found that they were still carrying on a well-regulated manufactory. There were two hundred and eighty men prisoners, and one hundred and seventeen women. These latter had on the house clothes, and were at work. Most of them were spinning or knitting, ranged in proper order, attentive and quiet. I was informed that all the prisoners are allowed one fifth of their earnings for themselves. I brought home specimens of the cloth, as I did of the paper from Brussels; which I mention, because I know an idea has prevailed, that no manufacture can be carried on by convicts to any valuable purpose.

[Antwerp.]

In the prison at Antwerp there are two rooms for citizens; and up stairs there is a cage, about six feet and a half square, into which criminals are put before the torture. - A criminal, while he suffers the torture, is cloathed in a long shirt, has his eyes bound, and a physician and surgeon attend him: and when a confession is forced from him, and wine has been given him, he is required to sign his confession; and about forty-eight hours afterwards he is executed.

In a small dungeon is a stone seat like some I have seen in old prison towers, in which it is said that formerly prisoners were suffocated by brimstone, when their families wished to avoid the disgrace

80 APPENDIX.

[Antwerp.]

of a public execution. No person here remembers an instance of this kind; but about thirty years ago there was a private execution in the prison. - In this prison there were only two prisoners.

[House of Correction.]

The river runs under the House of correction. At the entrance, on one side are the keeper's apartments; on the other, the warehouse and the room for the magistrates.* On three sides of a paved court there are thirteen cells for the men, and over them are the rooms for the women. On one side of the court are the young women who are put in by their parents or relations; and on the other, the criminals. All the men were employed in spinning cotton, so were some of the women, and the rest in making lace. A pound of cotton at a time is delivered to each; for spinning which, thirteen sous† are paid. I found, by the books, that at first coming, some did not earn more than seven or eight sous in a week, but soon after they earned from twelve to fourteen. Rye bread (to the value of half a stiver each meal) and water, is their allowance; and whatever they have more than this, they are required to pay for out of their earnings. They are obliged to put on clean linen every week, towards walking which each pays a sous. The stoves are heated twice a day, and candles and lamps are provided, at the expense of the magistrates.

There are three rooms for the ungovernable. One of them has a floor made of triangular pieces of wood a few inches asunder. The prisoner is chained in such a manner in the middle of this floor, that he can move but a few steps; and being allowed no shoes, whether

he stands or lies down, he must be in a very uneasy posture. - This room therefore is dreaded by the prisoners. The other rooms are abodes so dark and solitary as to be almost equally dreadful.

The men are never suffered to go out, except on Sundays and other holidays, when they go to the chapel, in which they have seats below. The women sit in a gallery with a lattice of wood before them. Here, and also in the prison, a table of regulations is hung up, which is read in public by the chaplain the first Sunday after the entrance of every prisoner. - These regulations consist of thirty-six articles, from which I have taken the following extracts.

The prisoners must be submissive to the keeper and to his wife; and if they think themselves injured, must complain to the regents. - The times fixed for rising are, at half after six in the morning from December 1st to February 15th, and all the rest of the year at five, or half after five; but on Sundays and holidays at six. - The times of meals are fixed at seven, twelve, and seven. - The prisoners are allowed, at their own expense, at breakfast a pint of tea; and at dinner soup or broth, or a pint of tea or small beer, and at supper the same quantity of tea or beer; and on Sundays and other holidays a certain quantity of boiled meat: and every week, a pound of butter, and fruit to the value of half a stiver* - Every day the keeper is obliged to prepare two dorts of soup or broth, and at seven in the morning to give the prisoners their choice of either dort, or none. - After service on Sundays, the men are permitted to walk in the court, and the women in the gallery half an hour, under the inspection of the keeper and officers. - They forfeit half a stiver, every time they curse or swear, or make a disturbance in the chapel; and also every time they are not up in half an hour after they are awaked by the keeper, and for every hour they sleep longer. - If they persist in insulting the

keeper or his wife after admonition, they pay a stiver, and are also punished by having their doors or windows fast closed up. - If ihey make any noise or disturbance after nine at night to break the rest of their fellow-prisoners, they are ordered to forfeit a schilling, and to be punished at the discretion of the regents: who are likewise empowered to make such alterations as they think proper in the rules; and in case of sickness or old age to give indulgences to the prisoners, with respect to their diet, times of rising, &c.

[Lille.]

At Lille, La Prison Royale is under no proper regulation. And the unhealthy countenances of the prisoners at the citadel, intimate the pernicious effects of lying in damp rooms, under the fortifications.*

The two hospitals La Comtesse and St. Sauveur are lofty buildings, designed only for the admission of men; for in this city there are no hospitals for sick women.† The patients are distinguished into three sorts, viz. wounded - very sick - and recovering: they have different wards assigned them accordingly. Every patient has a bed to himself. Here cleanliness is the agreeable effect of the great attention given to the patients by the Nuns.‡

* I observed this, because there was reason to apprehend, that some of the English prisoners at Dinnan would be removed hither.

† L'Hopital General indeed admits both sexes, but that is on a different foundation, and is somewhat similar to the houses of industry in Suffolk, Norfolk, and the Isle of Wight.

‡ When a sick person arrives at either of these hospitals, his bed is immediately shewed him. Then one of the sisters brings warm water, washes his feet, and dries them, and kisses one foot. Another brings clean sheets and a clean towel. A man-servant makes and warms the bed, and the patient goes directly into it.

FRANCE. 83

[Amiens.]

At Amiens are two prisons; one for Les Bourgeois et La Libertinage; the other, La Conciergerie. - In the town-house I saw great numbers attending the trial of a woman for confining her son. He was then about thirty-two years of age, and had been confined sixteen years, with a severity which had almost deprived him of his intellects. The prosecution was carried on by his father's relations, who had been long solicitous for his release.

[Paris.]

At Paris is L'Abbaye, a prison for the military or guards, and for such debtors as are of rank. - In the debtors rooms, a partition of lath and plaster detached from the brick-wall, is an expedient to prevent escapes. For if the smallest perforation be made in the partition, it is immediately discovered, by the mortar falling between that and the wall into the keeper's court, through the aperture which was left for that purpose.

I revisited the other prisons here. - The exemplary charity established for giving clean linen to prisoners is of great utility, and well conducted. The supplies are regularly brought to the prisons every Saturday.

The infirmaries are supported by charitable contributions: a decent old prisoner is chosen to be keeper; and the turnkey of the women's wards having less to do than others, has the immediate care

[Paris.]

of them. The physician and surgeons are appointed and paid by government: but the fuel, broth, drugs, linen, and all necessaries, are amply supplied by the charity.

Prisoners are not properly separated. Though one turnkey walks in the court to prevent combinations, yet it is difficult to keep such as become king's evidence apart from the rest; and the gaoler of Le Petit Chatelet was obliged to fit up a separate room for that purpose.

In this country, when prisoners have received their liberty from the king, or their creditors, they cannot be detained a moment for fees, hire of rooms, debts contracted in prison, or on any pretence whatever.

A prisoner of rank, a very sensible man, to whom I was speaking concerning gaolers, said, "They pay nothing to the crown, and their revenue is not small; at the Conciergerie, it is about fifteen thousand livres; at the Grand Chatelet, twenty thousand; at Fort L'Eveque, twenty thousand; at the Petit Chatelet, twelve thousand; at L'Abbaye, ten thousand. And all things considered," he added, "prisoners have no just reason to complain of this class of men in France."

The nomination of a gaoler belongs to the magistrates. When he has been nominated, he is proposed to the Procureur general; and if, after a careful enquiry into his character, it appears that he has the reputation of a man of probity, he is fixed in the office, and takes an oath of fidelity. The office is freely given him without any expense whatever.

FRANCE. 85

[Paris.]

In the Sal Petriere, or great hospital, there were but few of the female convicts employed.

[Bicetre.]

I was two mornings at the Bicetre, where I saw in the two halls above two hundred prisoners. Such a number confined together in idleness, must produce a great corruption of manners. Many at their unhappy end have ascribed their ruin to the flagitious examples they have here seen, and the instructions here given them.

The French now seem to be sensible of the bad police of confining persons here in idleness; for within the two last years they have set some of their prisoners to work. In one room I saw thirty-six employed in polishing plate glasses: and they are erecting a mill for grinding corn, which is to be worked by sixteen men at a time.

There were sixty-three in the infirmary, most of them ill of the scorbut. They contract this distemper in a year or two from their confinement, which is extremely close, since they are never suffered to go out of their rooms. Many lose the use of their limbs by it. I saw several such miserable objects at St. Louis's hospital, where they are often admitted at the expiration of their term at the Bicetre.

[Galley-Slaves.]

At the gate of St. Bernard is the prison for those who are condemned to the galleys: there were only fifteen prisoners, who were chained two and two together. Their daily allowance is one pound and a half of good bread, and half a pound of meat, and soup. On meagre days they are allowed pease in their soup. On their journey they have daily two pounds of bread, half a pound of meat, a pint of wine, and about a quarter of a pound of cheese, or eggs. - They are sent from hence to Marseilles, Toulon, Brest, &c. on the 25th of May and the 10th of September, and are joined by many other convicts

86 APPENDIX.

[Paris.]

from the provinces. I was informed that in May 1778, one hundred and sixty-three went off from this prison.

[Hospitals.]

L'Hopital de St. Louis for the sick, and L'Hotel de Dieu, are indeed the two worst hospitals that I ever visited. They were so crowded, that I have frequently seen four or five in one bed, some of them dying. In one of my visits at L'Hotel de Dieu, I observed the number of patients written up to be three thousand six hundred and fifty-five.*

But though these two hospitals are abominable, and a disgrace to Paris, it has many other charitable foundations which do honour to it; and from which this country may derive useful information. - This is a subject foreign to my chief purpose, and I have perhaps already enlarged too much upon it. I cannot help, however, just mentioning a few of these foundations.

In the Hopital de la Pitié there were about one thousand four hundred and twenty boys, who are clothed, and taught to read, spin, &c. These boys are admitted at about four years of age, and put out apprentices at thirteen or fourteen.

L'Hopital des Incurables is designed for the aged, infirm, and distorted, who are here clothed in a neat uniform, the men in gray, and the women in black. The Nuns attend upon them.

Le Quinze Vinct Hopital is appropriated to blind persons.

* Over one of the gates of this hospital is the following inscription, which, from its application to such a place, has an air of ridicule and even of profaneness.

"C'est icy la Maison de Dieu, et la Porte du Ciel."

FRANCE. 87

[Paris.]

L'Hopital des petites Maisons et des Insensez is situated in a spacious garden or court, containing a number of small houses for the aged and infirm of both sexes, and a hospital for the insane. Here are also infirmaries for the sick, which the Nuns kindly superintend. The neatness and cleanliness I observed in them gave me such pleasure as engaged me to repeat my visit. Each person of the insane has a separate room; and they also are taken care of by the good sisters.

[Bastille.]

In my last tour I had the good fortune to procure an extremely scarce pamphlet, published in 1774, written by a person who had long been confined in the Bastille. It is reckoned to contain the best account ever made public of this celebrated structure; and the sale of it is forbidden in France, on the severest penalties. I have copied from it the most material circumstances of the description, and have added the plate given in the work.

"The Bastille is a state prison, consisting of eight very strong towers, surrounded with a fosse about one hundred and twenty feet wide, and a wall sixty feet high. The entrance is at the end of the street of St. Antoine, by a draw-bridge, and great gates into the court of L'Hotel du Gouvernement, and from thence over another draw-bridge to the corps de garde, which is separated by a strong barrier constructed with beams plated with iron, from the great court. This court is one hundred and twenty feet by eighty. In it is a fountain; and six of the towers surround it, which are united by walls of free-stone ten feet thick up to the top. At the bottom of this court is a large modern corps de logis, which separates it from the court du Puits. This court is fifty feet by twenty-five. Contiguous to it, are the other two towers. On the top of the towers is a platform

88 APPENDIX.

[Bastille.]

form continued in terraces, on which the prisoners are sometimes permitted to walk, attended by a guard. On this platform are thirteen cannons mounted, which are discharged on days of rejoicing. In the corp de logis is the council chamber, and the kitchen, offices, &c. above these are rooms for prisoners of distinction, and over the council chamber the king's lieutenant resides. In the court du Puits is a large well for the use of the kitchen.

"The dungeons of the tower de la Liberté extend under the kitchen, &c. Near that tower is a small chapel on the ground floor. In the wall of it are five nitches or closets, in which prisoners are put one by one to hear mass, where they can neither see nor be seen.

"The dungeons at the bottom of the towers exhale the most offensive scents, and are the receptacles of toads, rats, and other kinds of vermin. In the corner of each is a camp-bed, made of planks laid on iron bars that are fixed to the walls, and the prisoners are allowed some straw to lay on the beds. These dens are dark, having no windows, but openings into the ditch: they have double doors, the inner ones plated with iron, with large bolts and locks.

"Of the five classes of chambers, the most horrid next to the dungeons are those in which are cages of iron. There are three of them. They are formed of beams with strong plates of iron, and are each eight feet by six.

"The Calottes, chambers at the top of the towers, are somewhat more tolerable. They are formed of eight arcades of free-stone. Here one cannot walk but in the middle of the room. There is hardly sufficient space for a bed from one arcade to another. The windows, being in walls ten feet thick, and having iron grates within

[Plate: The Bastille.]

FRANCE. 89

[Bastille.]

and without, admit but little light. In these rooms the heat is excessive in summer, and the cold in winter. They have stoves.

"Almost all the other rooms (of the towers) are octagons, about twenty feet in diameter, and from fourteen to fifteen high. They are very cold and damp. Each is furnished with a bed of green serge, &c. All the chambers are numbered. The prisoners are called by the name of their tower joined to the number of their room.

"A surgeon and three chaplains reside in the castle. If prisoners of note are dangerously ill, they are generally removed, that they may not die in this prison. - The prisoners who die there are buried in the parish of St. Paul, under the name of domestics.

"A library was founded by a prisoner who was a foreigner, and died in the Bastille the beginning of the present century. Some prisoners obtain permission to have the use of it.

"One of the centinels on the inside of the castle rings a bell every hour, day and night, to give notice that they are awake: and on the rounds on the outside of the castle they ring every quarter of an hour."

In inserting so particular an account of this place, my principal intention is to excite in my readers a strong detestation of despotism, and a love for the laws which are the foundation of our liberty.

[St. Omer's.]

At La Prison Royale, or the new prison, at St. Omer's, the daily allowance is a pound and a half of bread, and soup. The prisoners

90 APPENDIX.

[St. Omer's.]

have clean linen every week, which is the only reason why I mention this prison.

[Dunkirk.]

In the prison at Dunkirk, the French prisoners were in two or three rooms by themselves.

[English Prisoners.]

Here I found many of my countrymen prisoners of war. In five rooms there were a hundred and thirty-three, - captains, mates, passengers and common sailors all crowded together, - who lay on draw with one coverlid for every three persons. In three other rooms there were thirteen accommodated in a better manner, because most of them were ransomers* and capable of paying six sous a night for their beds. The court was small, being only forty-two feet by twenty-six; nor was there sufficient plenty of water. The bread, beer, and soup were good, and the beef tolerable.† Each room was supplied with two small faggots a day for firing. The sick (of whom there were only three) were taken to the military hospital, and great attention was paid to them. The regulations were hung up in English‡ and French.

* A ransomer is a person confined as a security, till the sum is paid for which a ship has been ransomed.

† In the last war, the contrast here was twelve sous a man; at present it is fifteen.

‡ BY THE KING.

RULES to be observed by all Prisoners of War in the Kingdom of France.

ARTICLE I.

THE orders given by the commissary of the marines encharged with the care of the prisoners are to be strictly complied with unargued and undisputed. None of the

[Bergues.]

[English Prisoners.]

In the prison at Bergues I found forty-seven English prisoners. The table of victualling was hung up here as at Dunkirk, but the

prisoners shall insult, threaten or abuse, much less strike the turnkey, nor any of those appointed to do business in the prison, under the penalty of incurring such punishment as shall be ordered by the commissary of the marines, and of losing turn of being exchanged; nay further they shall be close confined and deprived of one half of their food or pittance.

ART. II.

All and every prisoner, when the commissary makes review, shall answer to their name or names, and if in the list delivered to the commissary there be found any error, they shall point it out, that it may be rectified, in order to prevent the confusion that might result from mistaking of names.

ART. III.

All prisoners that shall refuse to answer to their names at the review, shall be punished by being deprived of their food till such time as they submit to the call.

ART. IV.

If there happen any damage to the place where the prisoners are kept, whether it be with intent to make an escape, or otherwise purposely and wilfully committed, the expense for repairing such damage shall be paid out of the food of those that are found guilty of the infringement, and if there be no means of discovering the guilty persons, all the prisoners shall contribute an equal share out of their food to the charges of such repair.

ART. V.

Whoever after escape from his prison is retaken, shall be shut in a dungeon, and shall be stinted to half his pittance of food, till he has by this confinement satisfied for the expenses made for seizing and bringing him back to gaol, and shall lose his turn of exchange besides. A sea-officer thus contravening, shall from that moment be looked upon and treated as a common sailor.

ART. VI.

It is forbidden to fight, quarrel or make any riot in the prisons or places where the prisoners are allowed to take the air, under pain of incurring such punishment as the offence may require.

provisions were not so good. There were twelve on their parole in this town, nine at Bourbourg, and two at Ardres, who told me they had procured bondsmen for their security.

[Calais.]

The common prison at Calais, being smaller than that at Dunkirk, was much crowded; for it contained one hundred and twenty-seven

ART. VII.

The prisons shall be kept clean and neat by the sailors, every man in his turn as shall be regulated, and whatever sailor shall refuse this service in his turn, his food shall be withheld from him till he submit to it.

ART. VIII.

The prisoners are to inform the commissary of the clothes or other necessaries they may want, and can pay for, and the commissary shall not only allow them to be provided with such things, but shall also take care they be not imposed upon in the price.

ART. IX.

In every prison the prisoners may appoint three or five of themselves, and change them at their pleasure, in order to inspect their victuals and see if they be good, and if they have their share or portion whether in weight or measure according to the following victualling table; and if there arise any reason for complaint, either of dressing, serving them up, or otherwise, they are with decency to apprise the commissary of it, who finding such complaint well grounded shall give immediate redress and do them justice.

ART. X.

It shall be allowed to tradesmen or sellers of ware (except such as deal in things that are not fit to be sold to prisoners) to wait at the great gate of the prisons from ten o'clock in the morning till three in the afternoon, in order to sell their ware to such prisoners as have wherewithal to pay for them on the spot.

ART. XI.

Whatever prisoner shall dare by this means to take or bring in strong liquors or other things that are not fit for prisoners, or shall receive or deliver any letter, shall be punished for the abuse he has made of this facility.

English prisoners. Seventeen sailors lay in one room* on straw, without coverlids; a few had not even straw: on my complaining of this to the Commissary, he said, he would send to St. Omer's for coverlids. After informing him farther, that I had found captains, passengers and mates confined in France, but that I supposed persons of this description in England were on their parole of honour; he replied, and desired I would note it down, that "a parole could not be granted without security; a hundred guineas for captains,"

[English Prisoners.]

"seventy-five for mates, sixty for sailors, and twenty-five for hoys." Passengers, I afterwards learned, were on the same footing with captains. On the second day of my being there, the rules (the same with those at Dunkirk) were hung up, both within and without this prison.

Many of the prisoners in this and other prisons had no change of linen, and some were almost entirely destitute of clothes, being the crews of vessels shipwrecked in the great storm of Dec. 31, 1778.

I found twenty-six of our people in a spacious ward in the military hospital, to whom great attention was paid. Each had a bed and sheets: and their bread and meat were good. But most of them having a disorder which did not break their spirits, they would have been better pleased if their allowance had been equal to that in the prison.

FRENCH PRISONERS in ENGLAND.

[French Prisoners.]

"When I visited my countrymen confined as prisoners of war in France, some of the Commissaries and other gentlemen informed me, that they had received great complaints from the French prisoners in England. On my return in January 1779, I waited on the Commissioners of the sick and wounded seamen, and gave them an account of the English prisoners in France, and of my intention to visit the French prisoners. In order to assist me in this business, they very readily and kindly favoured me with letters to their agents at several prisons.

FRENCH PRISONERS. 95

[French Prisoners.]

Having determined to take another general view of English prisons, to see what improvements had been made, in consequence of two late acts of parliament,* and of the charges given by the Judges in their circuits to the grand juries, I chose to begin my tour in those parts where most of the French prisoners were confined; and of them, therefore, I shall first give some account.

[Plymouth.]

In the Mill-prison near Plymouth, Feb. 3, 1779, there were three hundred and ninety-two French prisoners. The wards and courts in which they were confined, are not so spacious as those appropriated to the American prisoners, nor were they so well accommodated with provisions. The hospital, which had fifty patients in it, was dirty and offensive, and I found there only three pair of sheets in use. - Here a new prison was building.

In the ship Cambridge there were three hundred and ninety-six prisoners; and the next day, two hundred and fifty more were coming in. The bread was heavy, and the meat bad; and too little attention was paid to the sick. An hospital ship, called the Tiger, was fitting up for an infirmary.†

[Bristol.]

At Bristol, in a prison which had been a pottery, there were a hundred and fifty-one French prisoners, Feb. 9, 1779. The wards were more spacious and less crowded than those of the prison near

* 14th Geo. III. Cap. XLIII. and 16th Geo. III. Cap. XLIII.

† I suppose this was to be an infirmary only till the hospital which they were building in Mill-prison was finished. The wards in this new hospital will be too low and close.

96 APPENDIX.

[Bristol.]

[French Prisoners.]

Plymouth. There were no day rooms, in which many shoemakers, tailors, &c. were at work: an advantage which the prisoners at Plymouth desired, but could not obtain. - The bread was good. - There being no infirmary, the sick were attended and victualled at a small house near the prison, where seven shillings a week was paid for each parent. There were five in that house, in a dirty and offensive room.

[Winchester.]

There were one thousand and sixty-two confined in the prison at Winchester, March 2, 1779. The wards are lofty and spacious. The meat and beer were good: but the bread (being made with leaven and mixed with rye) was not so good as that at Bristol - If two or three of the rooms were to be used as work-rooms, the health of the prisoners would be promoted, and they would not be indolently lyng in their hammocks in the day-time; as I observed they were, both here and at Mill-prison.

Several prisoners were confined here in the dark hole. - Forty days confinement on half allowance, in order to pay ten shillings to those that apprehend them after escapes, seems to be too severe a punishment. On such occasions, the observation of the worthy magistrates at Berne always occurs to my mind, "that every one must be desirous of regaining liberty."

The hospital wards here are lofty, and upwards of twenty feet wide. Each patient had a cradle, bedding and sheets; and the surgeon paid them great attention.*

* Mr. Smith the agent also was assiduous in his department. He mentioned to me, that he thought it would be an advantage if one of their priests (two of whom were at a little distance on their parole) were permitted to attend the prisoners. This, he said, would be the means of comforting some, of aweing others, and of giving information whenever there was any just reason for complaints.

FRENCH PRISONERS. 97

[Forton.]

[French Prisoners]

In a prison not very convenient at Forton near Gosport, there were a hundred and seventy-seven French prisoners, March 2, 1779. On that day the meat was very bad, and had been killed, as the butcher's servant said, that morning: but it was returned, and Mr. Newsham the agent procured them good meat instead of it. - Most of the six pound loaves wanted weight. I saw the bread weighed for a hundred and forty-two prisoners, and observed a deficiency of three pounds. - The straw, by long use, was turned to dust in the mattresses, and many of them here, and at other places, had been emptied to clear them of vermin. The floors of the bed-rooms and hospitals could not but be dirty and offensive, the boards having been laid rough. I took notice of this kind of bad policy in all the floors of the new prison which was then building here, and almost finished.

The regulations are in the French language, and are the same with those published last war. They are evidently the original from which those printed in page 90 are translated. For the sake of greater accuracy, they will be given at the end of the book. I was informed both here and at Winchester, that they had been hung up, but were torn down. - Would it not be better, to paint them on a board, which should be fastened in some conspicuous place in every prison?

On the prisoners complaining that the bread was too light and the meat bad, I referred them to the ninth article of the regulations, by which they are directed to apply to the agent, and (if not re-dressed) to the Commissioners. One of them pertinently replied, "How is that possible, when every letter is examined by the agent?"*

* I could have wished, that the gentlemen concerned for the American prisoners, had extended their regards also to the French, and by their attention and visits had obliged the contractors to be more careful in discharging their duty.

98 APPENDIX.

[Deal.]

[French Prisoners.]

There is a new temporary prison at Deal for French prisoners. It has an airy and spacious room below, and another above, and a large and convenient kitchen. - The regulations were hung up, and the provisions of all forts were good. I made my first visit (as I do always) without the agents or contractors, and I had the pleasure of hearing the prisoners express their satisfaction.

The prison adjoins to the naval hospital, in which the sick and wounded prisoners have the convenience of a ward, similar to that which the English prisoners have at Dunkirk and Calais. There were seventy-three in the prison, and fifteen in this ward, April 17, 1779.

[Carlisle.]

In the county gaol at Carlisle, in one large room in the debtors ward, there were twelve French prisoners, May 10, 1779. They were not supplied with hammocks, as at Plymouth, Winchester, &c. but lay on straw without coverlids. - Their allowance, six pence a day.

[Pembroke.]

On the 5th and 6th of June 1779, I visited the prisons at Pembroke. There were fifty-six French prisoners in an old house adjoining to that in which the Americans were confined. Most of them had no shoes or stockings, and some were also without shirts. - They had no victualling table, nor did they know what was their allowance. There were two or three who had their allowance in money, which should have been three shillings and six pence a week each for their aliment, but six pence was deducted. - The common men, besides their allowance, received a penny a day each, by order of the French court. - They lay, in general, on the boards without straw; for there were but four hammocks in two rooms, each of which contained eighteen prisoners. Here was a court-yard, but no water or sewer.

FRENCH PRISONERS. 99

[Pembroke.]

[French Prisoners.]

In the two rooms of the town gaol there were twenty French prisoners. They had some straw, but it had not been changed for many French weeks. Having no supply of water in the gaol, and not being permitted, as they are at the other prison, to fetch water for themselves, they are often neglected. On Sunday at noon, no water had been brought to them from Friday evening. - They walked in a field, with a guard, about an hour every day. - Their bread was tolerable, but their beer very small, and their allowance of beef so scanty, that they preferred an allowance of cheese and butter.

At a house appropriated for an hospital, there were nine French prisoners, besides five of the crew of the Culloden man of war, and three Americans. These lay in three or four rooms on straw with coverlets, but without sheets, mattresses or bedsteads.

Such observations as these have convinced me, that humanity and good policy require that an inspector of the prisoners of war should be appointed, who should be obliged to report quarterly their state as to health, provisions &c.

[Chester.]

At Chester Castle, Aug. 27, 1779, there were twenty-three French prisoners of war. They were healthy and well, and made no complaint.

[Liverpool.]

At Liverpool, on Nov. 30, 1779, were five hundred and nine prisoners of war, all French, except fifty-six Spaniards, who were kept separate on account of the animosities between the two nations. These were all confined in four or five rooms crowded with hammocks three tier high; but they had a spacious airing ground. There were thirty-six sick in some small dirty rooms of a house at a

100 APPENDIX.

[Liverpool.]

[French Prisoners.]

distance from the prison. These had no sheets; but much attention seemed to be paid them by the surgeon, and they made no complaints. At the prison the bedding wanted regulation. No table of rules or victualling was hung up, or ever had been. The prisoners rejoiced at the discharge of the late agent; and from the character of the present, have every reason to expect all due attention and humanity. Their meat was fine and good; the beer good; the bread heavy.

Here, as well as at all the other places throughout the kingdom where French prisoners are confined, I found that there was an allowance from the French court of one penny per day to all sailors and boys; two pence to boatswains, carpenters, &c.; and three pence to those of superior rank; which is regularly paid them every month. There is besides a supply from the same court of clothes, linen, and shoes to those who are destitute of these articles: a noble and exemplary provision, much to the honour of those who at present conduct public affairs in France!*

FRENCH PRISONERS in SCOTLAND.

[Edinburgh.]

I found in the Castle at Edinburgh, July 6, 1779, sixty-four French prisoners, in two rooms formerly used as barracks for the soldiers. In one of the rooms they lay on straw, two and two, in boxes against the wall, with two coverlids to each box: in the other

* I have since heard that a bounty is paid by the Court of England to their prisoners in France, at the following rates, viz. captains, mates, sailing masters, surgeons, and stewards, three pence per day each; common sailors, boys, and passengers of inferior rank, three halfpence per day each; which payment is made every twenty-eight days.

AMERICAN PRISONERS. 101

[French Prisoners.]

room they lay on mattresses in hammocks. - The regulations as to diet, &c. were hung up. Their bread was excellent, and all other provisions good; nor was there any thing of which they made complaint. - They received every month, the allowance from the French court. - There were fourteen in the hospital, which was a house at some distance in the city, where they had bedding and sheets, and great attention was paid them by the humane surgeon and agent.

FRENCH PRISONERS in IRELAND.

[Belfast.]

On the 13th of July 1779, there were seventy-seven French prisoners at Belfast, who had been brought there the beginning of May. - There was no table of regulations, and they Teemed to be very much neglected. Sixteen of them were in the hospital, including three attendants. Many others were sick, but in the hospital there was neither room nor accommodations for them.

[Dublin.]

At Dublin, July 12, 1779, there were twenty-two prisoners of war, in a good room fitted up for a temporary prison. Their bread and other provisions were very good; and they were treated with all the humanity and kindness that could be expected.

AMERICAN PRISONERS.

[Plymouth.]

[American Prisoners.]

In the Mill-prison near Plymouth, there were two hundred and ninety-eight American prisoners on the 3d of February 1779. Their wards and court were spacious and convenient, and their bread, beer, and meat good.

102 APPENDIX.

[Forton.]

[American Prisoners.]

The Americans were equally well accommodated at Forton near Gosport, where I found two hundred and fifty-one prisoners, March 2, 1779.

The table of regulations is almost the same with that for the French prisoners. The principal difference is, that in the victualling table, the bread allowance is but one pound a day.

[Pembroke.]

At Pembroke, June 5, 1779, there were confined in an old house thirty-seven American prisoners. Some of them were without shoes and stockings. - There was no victualling table, or table of regulations; nor did they know what the allowance ordered by government was, except only that it was the same with the allowance for the French prisoners. - They lay on straw on the floor, and their straw had not been changed for six or seven weeks. - By liberal subscriptions, ample provision has been made for the other American prisoners: I was sorry to find that these had been entirely overlooked.

In a house appropriated for an hospital, in which were some Englishmen and French prisoners, I found also three American prisoners very poorly accommodated.

Before I leave this subject, it will be but justice to mention the care and assiduity of the Commissioners of the sick and wounded seamen, &c. in London, who have themselves visited many of the prisons in England, and dismissed such agents as had abused their trust; and who are ready to receive any information which may be for the benefit of those committed to their inspection.

SCOTLAND. 103

[Scotland.]

It may not be improper, before I enter on a particular account of English prisons, to mention what further occurred to me worthy of observation, in a journey into Scotland and Ireland in the summer, 1779.

The prisons which I saw in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, Stirling, Jedburgh, Air, &c. were old buildings, dirty and offensive, without court-yards, and also generally without water. They are not visited by the magistrates: and the gaolers are allowed the free sale of the most pernicious liquors.

If a prisoner for debt declares upon oath that he has not wherewithal to maintain himself, the creditor must aliment him within ten days after notice is given for that purpose, with at least three pence a day,* but generally the magistrates order six pence. - By the process of Cessio bonorumm† a debtor after being a month in prison, may obtain his liberty, and be secured against execution for any previous debts, by making a surrender of all his effects to be divided among his creditors: though if he afterwards comes into better circumstances, his effects may be attached for the payment of those

debts. This compassionate law prevents a creditor putting his debtor in prison, unless he has good reason to believe he is acting fraudulently.

Perjury is not frequent in Scotland. The oath, and the form of administering it, are very solemn. The witness, holding up his right hand, repeats the following words after the judge: - "By God himself, and as you shall answer to God at the great day of judgment, you shall declare the truth, and nothing but the truth, in so far as you know, or shall be asked at you." - The depositions are read over by the clerk, and signed by the witnesses and the judge.* - It is enacted by the 20th of George II. that "the circuit-courts shall be regularly held twice in every year, within that part of Great Britain called Scotland, and the Judges thereof shall continue by the space of six days at the least, at each town or place where the circuit-courts shall be held, for the dispatch of business."†

There are in Scotland but few prisoners; this is partly owing to the shame and disgrace annexed to imprisonment; partly to the solemn manner in which oaths are administered, and trials and executions conduced; and partly to the general sobriety of manners produced by the care which parents and ministers take to instruct the rising generation.‡

I am indebted to Andrew Crosbie, Esq. for an account, from the Clerk of the Justiciary, of the executions from January 1768 to July 1779, which shall be inserted in a table at the end of the book; from which it will appear, that in ten years and a half there have been only thirty-nine executed, and eighteen pardoned.

In Scotland, executions are not delayed after conviction or sentence; a delay which is often equally injurious to the criminal and to society. Here, the punishment of the offender is made to appear the immediate consequence of his crime.*

All criminals are tried out of irons; and when acquitted, immediately discharged in open court.

Many schools are also settled by donations and legacies, and by the society for propagating christian knowledge; so that no parish is without a school, and in some there are four or five. In the southern parts of Scotland, it is very rare that you meet with any person that cannot both read and write. It is scandalous for any person not to be possessed of a Bible, which is always read in the parochial schools.

I was happy in finding at Dublin a new gaol (Newgate) almost ready for the removal of the prisoners into more airy and convenient apartments, in which the shocking intercourse of the two sexes which took place in the old prison, will be avoided. This new prison is one hundred and seventy feet in length, and has separate courts for men and women. The cells on the first and second floors are about twelve feet by eight, and on the upper floor twelve by four, all arched with brick, to prevent danger from fire.* Besides these

Item, All creditors or incarcerators of prisoners for civil debt or otherwise shall be free of all fees to the clerk at incarceration.

there are dungeons, but I hope they will never be used. It might be best to convert the chapel at the top of the house into an infirmary; for the sick rooms are too small, and likely to produce infection.

In the men's court there is a pump which supplies good water, and I suppose the women's court will be provided with another. Great attention should be paid to air and cleanliness in the stair-cases, and the narrow passages* leading to the cells, to prevent them from becoming offensive and infectious.

The criminals in the gaols of Ireland are very numerous; one reason of which may be, that in this country there are no houses of correction;† and another, that acquitted persons are continued in confinement till they have discharged their fees to the clerk of the crown, or peace, the sheriff, gaoler and turnkey.‡ Even boys almost

† It may be an exception, that in a house adjoining to Newgate there were several fines, &c. and in another small house adjoining to the work-house in Dublin, I found eleven young creatures who for small offences were confined with outrageous lunatics of both sexes. The magistrates seem to have overlooked a compassionate clause of their legislature the 3d of George III. Chap. XXVIII. "that persons of insane mind and outrageous behaviour" are not to go in common with the other prisoners.

‡ There is an act for discharging without fees persons who shall be acquitted "of offences for which they are or shall be indicted, and for making a compensation to sheriffs, gaolers, clerks of the crown, and clerks of the peace, for such fees," by a presentment on the respective counties. But many that are acquitted receive no benefit by it, because the presentment must be made by the foreman of the petty jury to the grand jury, and confirmed by the Judges of assize; and the sum presented at one assize must not exceed "ten pounds if it be a county at large; or five pounds, if it be a county of a city or county of a town." 3d George III. Cap. V, p. 100, 101.

naked, and under the age of twelve, are sometimes confined two years for these fees, though amounting to no more than about forty shillings. How surprising is it, that any kingdom can endure such injustice! It is a particular aggravation of it, that the prisoners thus confined generally lose, at the same time, their allowance of bread. I have heard that Mr. Justice Aston always ordered the acquitted prisoners to be discharged. - Some boys were lately released from the county gaol at Kilmainham, paying half fees; and others from Newgate, the Sheriffs of Dublin generously relinquishing their fees. But as those boys had been associated with the most profligate and abandoned felons for many months, I did not in the least wonder to find that some of them returned to their former habitation in a few days.

On passing this prison frequently, I could not avoid observing officers from the recruiting regiments waiting at the doors and windows, to receive either the offenders who were permitted to enlist, or any of their associates. When the excessive profligacy and daring wickedness of this set of people is considered, the most melancholy apprehensions must be entertained, of the dreadful consequences likely to result from their mixture with those who may have had a sober education, and have entered voluntarily into the service of their country; and likewise of the danger to society in general, front turning loose such a set of wretches at the close of a war.

Our English prisons have also contributed their share towards recruiting the army, enlisting being the condition on which many have obtained their release from confinement, or immunity from some other punishment. I shall make no farther remark on this practice,

but that if it be a necessary one, the legislature may receive some satisfaction from the effects of their late salutary laws respecting the health of prisoners. If this mode had been adopted while prisons were in their former state, it would have been the occasion of carrying the most fatal diseases into the midst of our seamen and soldiers.

There is a new Marshalsea prison in Dublin. The first stone was laid, as appears by the inscription, July 3, 1775. Here were about sixty prisoners. - In the city Marshalsea, which is a very old building, there were fifty-five debtors. Many debtors in this and the other prisons, being not alimented, are objects of compassion. But the most needy of them are relieved by the care of a humane society at Dublin, similar to that called the Thatched-House Society in London. - Such societies deserve the highest praise. I wish however to recommend to compassion other prisoners, who though they seem to deserve assistance less, yet need it more, to save them from the ruin to which the bad state of the Irish prisons exposes them.

I am sorry to mention the common and pernicious use of spirituous liquors in the Irish prisons. - In Newgate, and in the county gaols that I visited, there were no tables of fees hung up.

There is an Irish act for preserving the health of prisoners, passed in the 17th and 18th of George III. Chap. XXVIII. similar to the English act* for the same purpose. But I did not find it "hung up"

* This differs from the English act in one important circumstance. The English act requires "the walls and cielings of the several cells and wards, both of the debtors and the felons, and also of any other rooms used by the prisoners in their respective"

[Dublin.]

in any of the prisons. - There is also an act of the same year, similar to the English act, for "the punishment, by hard labour, of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported." But the hulks on the Thames having cruelly destroyed many healthy and robust young men, their cries probably reached the Irish shore, and prevented any proceedings in consequence of that act.

HULKS on the THAMES.

[Hulks.]

In my former work, p. 75, I ventured to pass some censures on the management of prisoners committed to hard labour on the Thames; and in a subsequent visit I was still more convinced of the faults I had observed. The effects of these became so alarming, as to attract the notice of Parliament. A public enquiry was instituted, by which it appeared, that from August 1776, when the convicts were first put on board the vessels, to March 26, 1778, out of six hundred and

"gaols and prisons, where felons are usually confined, to be scraped and white-washed, once in the year at least, to be regularly washed and kept clean," &c. whereas the Irish act requires the same precautions in the cells, wards, and rooms of gaols and prisons without restriction; for the clause "where felons are usually confined" is omitted. I have known it pleaded as an excuse for not white-washing and keeping clean prisons in England where only debtors or petty offenders have been confined, that they were not obliged to it by the act of parliament.

HULKS on the THAMES. 113

[Hulks.]

thirty-two prisoners who had been received, one hundred and seventy-six had died. It is with pleasure that I can now give an account, which will shew in a striking light the beneficial effects of this parliamentary interference, and the obligations the public are under to the Committee appointed on this occasion, and particularly to its chairman, Sir Charles Bunbury.

At my last visit, Nov. 16, 1779, there were at Woolwich, for the reception of convicts, an old India man, called the Justitia; and a frigate, the Censor. In the former were two hundred and fifty-six; and in the latter, two hundred and fifty. That which was first called the Justitia, is now converted into an hospital ship, in which were twenty patients. - Another, called the Reception, was empty: in this, convicts are examined by the surgeon, and continue four days, before they are sent either to the hulks, or to the hospital ship.*

The prisoners on board the Justitia looked healthy and well; the decks were clean. They had bedding; their provisions were good of the sort; and there were not any (as at my former visits) without shoes and stockings. - I found the Censor, below deck, cleaner than the Justitia; yet, on carefully viewing the convicts, they had not so healthy and contented an aspect as those in the other; and a much greater proportion of this ship's company was sent to the hospital. This created in me a suspicion that something was wrong. I examined all their provisions, bedding, &c. and found that they were the same as on board the Justitia. It would be highly proper that a table of their stated allowance should be hung up, and scales, weights, and measures assigned them,† to check the pursers who give out their

provision.* - In the Hospital ship, on the two decks (one of which is for recovering patients) were twenty-five cradles with beds similar to those in the Royal Hospitals at Haslar and Plymouth, where all lie single. Of the few who were very sick, I found their irons were off. The cleanliness and quietness of the hospital do honour to the conductor. It is to be wished that the patients had better nourishment, as that in many cases would be more salutary than medical prescriptions.

There were about one hundred and fifty at work in the Warren; most of them clothed in a brown uniform.

The situation of these unhappy people is greatly altered for the better. Yet their bread allowance should be half a pound more; for one pound a day is too little, especially for those who work, although they have an extra allowance of beer. There should also be to each bed, in winter, an additional blanket.

[Gaol Fever.]

I shall take the liberty here to subjoin a few additional remarks on the Gaol fever; in which, if I shall appear to have invaded the province of the gentlemen of the faculty, I hope to be pardoned, from the consideration that my experience in this matter may in some respect supply my want of other means of knowledge.

If it were asked, what is the cause of the gaol fever? it would in general be readily replied, "the want of fresh air and cleanliness." But as I have found in a few prisons abroad, cells and dungeons as offensive and dirty as any I have observed in this country, where, however, this distemper was unknown, I am obliged to look out for

* Pursers weights are known on board ships to be two ounces in a pound short, their measures in proportion.

GAOL FEVER. 115

[Gaol Fever.]

some additional cause for its production. I am of opinion, that the sudden change of diet and lodging so affects the spirits of new convicts, that the general causes of putrid fevers exert an immediate effect upon them. Hence it is common to see them sicken and die in a short time, with very little apparent illness. Convicts are generally stout robust young men, who have been accustomed to free diet, tolerable lodgings, and vigorous exercise. These are ironed, and thrust into close offensive dungeons, some of them without straw or other bedding; in which they continue, in winter, sixteen or eighteen hours out of the twenty-four, in utter inactivity, and immersed in the noxious effluvia of their own bodies. On this account, the gaol distemper is always observed to reign more in our prisons during winter than summer; contrary, I presume, to the nature of other putrid diseases. Their diet is at the same time low and scanty; and the powers of life soon become incapable of resisting so many causes of sickness and despair.

After the gaol fever has prevailed in a prison, nothing, probably, will be so effectual in destroying all remains of infection, as the mode of fumigation practised by the ingenious Dr. Lind for infected ships. I shall therefore extract some of the most important particulars of this process from the account with which the doctor favoured me.

"Charcoal fires should be lighted in the morning, and allowed to remain till evening, and half a pound of brimstone thrown upon each, their smoke in the mean time being closely confined. They may be made in iron pots. - This fumigation should be repeated every day for a fortnight. Every evening after the fumigation, the ports and hatchways should be opened, and the inside of the ship washed with warm vinegar: and after the last fumigation,"

116 APPENDIX.

[Gaol Fever.]

"before the men return to the ship, the decks should be thoroughly scraped and cleaned. If the infection has been very violent, the parts of the ship most exposed to it may also be white-washed. - Every thing ragged and dirty should be destroyed, as also the clothes and bedding of such as brought the infection into the ship, the bedding of such as have died of the fever, and unless the infection has been very mild, the bedding of such as have had the fever though recovered. The remaining clothes and bedding should be purified by being exposed twice a week to the steams of the brimstone and charcoal; or when the brimstone might be supposed to injure the clothes, they may be hung up in a close place, exposed to the smoke of tobacco strewed on charcoal fires. Linens, and such articles as will admit of being wet, should after the first fumigation be steeped for several hours in cold water or leys, be well washed, and then dried in the open air. - If, during the fortnight of this fumigation, any person is taken ill of the fever, the fortnight should again commence from the day on which such person leaves the ship. - Strict attention should be paid to the cleanliness of the men both in their persons and apparel: such as are sluggish and dirty should be made to bathe and clean themselves; and a sufficient quantity of slops should be issued, that every man may have a change of clothes."*

* I have observed in prisons abroad a very cheap and pleasant fumigation, which surprisingly corrects the bad air. I suppose it is the same as is used in Roman catholic churches, viz. juniper berries thrown upon burning coals in a chaffing-dish.

ENGLAND.

LONDON.

[London.]

THE TOWER is a strong fortress, and the only prison in England for state delinquents of rank. The care of it is committed to an officer called the Constable of the Tower, who has under him a lieutenant, deputy-lieutenant called the governor, and many other officers, among whom are forty warders, whose uniform is the same with the king's yeomen of the guards. Nineteen of these warders have separate houses well furnished, in any of which, as the governor is pleased to order, the state delinquents may be confined; and the custom has been to assign them two of the best rooms on the first floor. Sometimes they are committed to close confinement; but in general they are at liberty to walk in the area of the Tower, attended always by a warder.

There have been no prisoners here for a few years past; and when there are any, their fate is soon determined by a legal trial, and consequently their confinement can never be long. Six shillings and eight pence a day is allowed by government for their subsistence, but they seldom accept this allowance.

In this fortress, besides the houses just mentioned, there are several public offices and store-houses; such, particularly, as the office of Ordnance, the Jewel-office, the Mint, and buildings for holding artillery and arms.

The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up, and no regard paid to it. The allowance a penny loaf a day each, weight in Aug. 1779, twelve ounces.

This prison might be made more commodious, by building on a piece of ground at the back of it, forty-one feet by twenty, which the keeper now uses as a garden.

COUNTY GAOL AT HERTFORD.

The new gaol has separate wards and courts for debtors, men-felons and women-felons; and the whole is now surrounded by a wall fifteen feet high.

In mentioning the gaol fever I should have added, I was informed that a prisoner brought out of the dungeon as dead, on being pumped on in the yard, recovered. Since this I have known other instances of the same kind.

COUNTY GAOL at CHELMSFORD.

Chaplain, Rev. Mr. Morgan.

Salary now £50.

The new prison is occupied. The felons apartments are entirely out of sight from the gaoler's house. I beg leave to observe, that a window might be made in the gaoler's kitchen, which would overlook the felons court-yard: and that the window in the debtors apartment toward the street is highly improper, as an avenue for introducing at all times spirituous liquors, tools, &c.

KENT.

[Kent.]

COUNTY GAOL at MAIDSTONE.

No alteration.

I found the gaoler attentive to cleanliness and regularity. Clauses of act against spirituous liquors are hung up.

The felons apartments are the better for not having glass windows. The wall being three feet and a half thick, in some measure breaks the force of the wind. The felons five night-rooms have double doors; if one of them was an iron-grate door (as at the new gaol at Horsham) and locked up in the day-time, the rooms would freshen and be better ventilated.

1779, April 16, Debtors 15. Felons 23, including 14 Convicts.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

MAIDSTONE. The new prison dirty and offensive. It is necessary to choose keepers who are attentive to cleanliness and neatness. The county allowance is three pence every day but Sundays. They were at work, but have no part of what they earn. Fees, 3s. 6d. No table. I saw two with the small-pox, lying on loose straw, and their only covering was common mats.

1779, April 16, Prisoners 13.

DARTFORD. Now there are two courts from the keeper's garden, one for each sex, with pumps and sewers, and a room in the men's court for the sick, But the women had no mats, or any sort of bedding.

1779, April 15, Prisoners 5.

ROCHESTER CITY GAOL.

The court-room was built, as appears by the date, in 1687; and it is probable, there has been no alteration in the prison since. The room for debtors in the keeper's house, is only for such as can pay for a bed; for I found two in the close offensive room towards the street, who had been locked up there some weeks.

1779, April 15, Debtors 2. Felons 0.

DOVER CASTLE.

Frederic Lord North is now Constable of the Castle; and Henry Wood, Bodar. The two rooms were white-washed, and much cleaner than at my former visit.

No alteration; but the new keeper has a salary, £10. No licence. The gaol was much cleaner; and company were not drinking there, as at my former visits.

SUSSEX.

[Sussex.]

COUNTY GAOL at HORSHAM.

The new gaol does credit to the Gentlemen that superintended the work: it is every way substantial and strong; and each felon is to have a separate room, ten feet by seven, and nine feet high to the crown of the arch. They are all arched with brick, to prevent danger and confusion in case of fire. To each room are two doors, one of them iron-grated.

1779, March 9, Debtors 12. Felons &c. 6. in the old gaol.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

At Horsham the Bridewell was discontinued, and the keeper discharged.

LEWES. No alteration. The apartments for each sex similar, but separate; a kitchen, five bed-rooms ten feet square, work-shop, &c. Though I found no prisoners at work, it seems, they are sometimes employed in making whiting, as there were chalk, mallets, sieves, &c. in the men's work-rooms. The keeper has all the profits of their work. The county allowance is a twopenny loaf (the weight was 1 lb. 5 oz.) The keeper's house is detached, so that he has no view from thence into the prisoners rooms or courts.

1779, April 19, Prisoners 8.

PETWORTH. The keeper's salary is now augmented to £30, in lieu of fees. The bread allowance is now a two-pound loaf

The alteration is a pump in the court.

1779, March 8, No prisoners.

BATTLE. Two rooms fourteen feet by twelve and a half, in one of which is a chimney, in the other the stocks. Court-yard not secure. No water, but in the keeper's garden. Allowance, seven farthings a day; the same, the old keeper says, in the thirty years of his time, and in the many years of his father's time. Salary, £10. Fees, 3s. 4d.

1779, April 18, No prisoners.

RYE. The town gaol is an old tower. The lower rooms are, one about seventeen feet diameter, with a fire-place, and two small ones of about six feet; and above stairs are three rooms of the same dimensions. Allowance to prisoners, three halfpence a day. Fees, 3s. 4d. No table. Salary, none. Keeper, a sergeant at mace.

1779, April 18, No prisoners.

132 APPENDIX.

SURRY.

[Surry.]

COUNTY GAOL in SOUTHWARK.

No alteration. The gaol was clean, and none of the prisoners sick.

Here I would just mention, that all the rags left by the felons after every assize, ought to be immediately buried (the earth absorbs putrid matter) or burnt; as they only serve to harbour vermin, dirt, and infection.

1779, Aug. 9, Debtors 23. Felons &c. 14.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

St. GEORGE'S FIELDS. No alteration. The fines or convicts are with the other prisoners, and have the same allowance. All are entirely without employment.*

1779, Aug. 9, Prisoners 44.

KINGSTON upon Thames. The act for preserving the health of prisoners was hung up, but little attention paid to it. The prison was dirty, and the prisoners unemployed, the keeper informing me, that they were not committed for hard labour, though one was imprisoned for a year. The three-halfpenny loaf weighed seventeen ounces and a quarter.

1779, March 11, Prisoners 6.

* At my last visit I observed the convicts were employed, in Clerkenwell bridewell, in picking oakum, as I have seen in some houses of correction near the sea shore. This is a salutary employment, as the strongsceent of the pitch and tar may counteract any contagious or unhealthy effluvia in the work-rooms.

CAMBRIDGE TOWN BRIDEWELL.

[Cambridgeshire.]

In the spring, 1779, seventeen women were confined in the daytime, and some of them at night, in the work-room, which has no fire-place or sewer. This made it extremely offensive, and occasioned a fever or sickness among them, which alarmed the Vice-chancellor, who ordered all of them to be discharged. Two or three of them died within a few days. There are now added two rooms, in one of which are five cages about seven feet square: no fire-place.

The prisoners bread allowance now twelve ounces: straw, £1: 6: 0 a year. Clauses of act against spirituous liquors are hung up.

The women have still their low night-room, and no separate day-room. The room adjoining, improperly used for a stable, would be very convenient.

Gaol-delivery being only once a year, three prisoners must be confined from eight to ten months before their trial: as two were committed Nov. 6, 1778, and one woman Aug. 22, 1778.

The prisoners were at work. The daily allowance is two pennyworth of bread. The keeper's salary, £25. Here is no separate court for the women.

I did not know, till this visit, that here are dungeons down fifteen steps; in one part four for the men; and in another part, three for the women. In these, as in the other rooms, are cribs. It is to be hoped that Gentlemen who have made many improvements in their gaol, will be so considerate as to order these cells to be barred to all, unless to such as are very refractory and disobedient.

WYMUNDHAM. No alteration, but the dungeon arched with brick. It is fifteen feet and a half by eight feet, and six feet high: a dirt floor: has two apertures at the top, of a foot diameter. The Justices seem to have overlooked a clause in a late act of parliament, "to prevent the prisoners from being kept under ground, whenever they can do it conveniently,"* as there is abundant room on the premises. In the room up stairs were four dirty pale and sick women at work, with padlocks on their legs, though never out in the court except on Sundays. The very small quantity of straw on the floor was worn almost to dust.

Here are no alterations, but the water from the pump conveyed through the sewers, which prevents the court-yard, which is small, from being offensive; and there is allowance to the gaoler for conveying prisoners to Bury.

The Justices of this county have taken the gaol and bridewell under consideration, and propose that debtors and felons, and also men and women, in both, shall be entirely separated.

There were hung up in the debtor's hall some rules against profaneness, rioting, and drunkenness, with penalties annexed; but I was sorry to find among them that "Every debtor at his or her first coming must pay for garnish 2s. 6d."

I beg leave to suggest, that if a wall were built with brick, instead of the clay wall, there would be no need for a chain and a log, to secure the prisoners in the court. The apartments also would be more airy, and men and women might be separated, if the narrow court were enlarged from the orchard, which is now let by the keeper for £6 per annum.

Two pence a day is allowed for meat, to each of the felons. The chapel is in a more convenient situation than formerly. The table of fees is now signed and hung up. That which the gaoler shewed me on my former visits was neither dated, signed, nor hung up -, which occasioned my saying in my former work, "No table of fees."

No alteration. The common-side debtors pay one shilling and six pence, and the master-side two shillings and six pence a week for lodging. No table of fees. The chapel is much too small. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is painted on a board in the debtors court.

1779, April 21, Debtors 9. Felons &c. 9. Impressed Men 19.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

WINDSOR CASTLE PRISON.

No alteration. The preamble in the table of fees (for the Honour and Castle of Windsor) recites, "that complaint having been made to me of some abuses and irregularities committed in demanding and receiving fees, - the table being defaced, so that the words and figures are hardly legible," - This table was made, the first year of George II. May 10th, 1728. subscribed, Carlisle. There seems the same ground of complaint with respect to the present table being defaced. As the fees are lower here than in most other prisons, the table should be preserved to prevent impositions.

1779, March 10, Prisoner 1.

WINDSOR TOWN GAOL.

No alteration.

OXFORDSHIRE.

[Oxfordshire]

COUNTY GAOL, OXFORD CASTLE.

Chaplain now Rev. Mr. Cotton.

It is very probable, that the rooms in this castle are the same that the prisoners occupied, at the time of the Black Assize. The wards are close and offensive, so that if crowded, I should not greatly wonder to hear of another fatal assize at Oxford.

1779, Feb. 25, Debtors 12. Felons &c. 15.

1779, July 29, Debtors 13. Felons &c. 4.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

THAME. No alteration in the house, but in February the prisoners were carding and spinning. Clauses of act against spirituous liquors not hung up. From midsummer 1778 to midsummer 1779, twenty-six persons were committed to this prison.

1779, Feb. 25, Prisoners 4.

1779, Oct. 20, Prisoners 0.

WITNEY. No alteration in the house. The prisoners were at work: the keeper now is a manufacturer, and employs them all. He pays them for their work, two pence a pound for the chain, and three halfpence for the foot, so that each earns about three pence a day.

1779, February 26, Prisoners 7.

Oxford Circuit. WORCESTERSHIRE. 159

COUNTY GAOL, WORCESTER CASTLE.

[Worcestershire.]

The castle-yard is raised and gravelled. A workman for a guinea a year keeps the hand-ventilator always in repair. A larger and more convenient room is now fitted up for a chapel. I found this prison very clean, especially the debtors' apartments. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is written on paper, and hung up.

1779, May 18, Debtors 19. Felons &c. 8.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at WORCESTER.

Here I found a new keeper: the prison very clean: and a window in the men's night-room up stairs. The prisoners were employed, beating hemp.

1779, May 18, Prisoners 6.

WORCESTER CITY and COUNTY GAOL.

No alteration: the keeper does not now pay the window-tax. In respect to cleanliness, this is a contrast to the two prisons immediately preceding.

1779, May i8. Debtors 6. Felons &C.4. Impressed Men 3. Deserters 2.

KIDDERMINSTER TOWN GAOL.

Two rooms called dungeons about ten feet by eight, down six steps, under the market-house. No court: no water: no sewer: Debtors from the Court of Requests are cleared in forty days. The cryer is keeper, has a shilling a month for attendance, and a billing for straw.

1779, August 30, No prisoners.

160 APPENDIX.

STAFFORDSHIRE

[Staffordshire.]

COUNTY GAOL at STAFFORD.

No alteration. The debtors court and free-ward are spacious; in the latter is a hand-ventilator for the felons dungeon, which being out of repair, has not been used for some years. Were the county to allow the small sum of a guinea a year, it might always be kept in order, as is done in Worcester castle. An alarm-bell in this crowded gaol would be very proper.

Mr. Hughes (now the surgeon) is apothecary to the county infirmary, which is near the gaol. He receives £8 of the £20 allowed by the county, and the remaining £12 is paid to the infirmary for drugs.

1779, May 15, Debtors 40. Felons &c. 14. Impressed Men 11.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

STAFFORD. No alteration: the prison clean, and the prisoners employed in spinning; but the wheels do not belong to the county.

1779, May 15, Prisoners 9.

WOLVERHAMPTON. No alteration. 1779, Aug. 23, Prisoners 2.

LITCHFIELD. To the two close cells are added two new ones, and two rooms for debtors; a court is enclosed, in which is an offensive sewer.

No alteration. Here are three large lamps in the court supplied at the county's expense. The act for preserving the health of prisoners, clauses against spirituous liquors, the prohibition of garnish, and a new table of fees, were all hung up, and very conspicuous. The day-room for felons is fifteen feet and a half by five and a half: men and women together. Here were several convicts, one of whom had been ordered to the Thames summer assize, 1777.

Shropshire. A Table of the Rates and Fees to be taken by the Gaoler for the County of Salop, settled - by the Justices of the Peace for the said County - the 14th day of July 1778.

COUNTY GAOL at HEREFORD.

No alteration, but the chapel boarded, and now dry. Here I found several convicts, two of whom had been ordered to the Thames at summer assize, 1777.

1779, May 17, Debtors 19. Felons &c. 9. Impressed Men 6.

164 APPENDIX.

[Herefordshire.]

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at HEREFORD.

1779, May 17. The prisoners were in the county gaol, and they were repairing this prison, for the cross-wall had fallen in. But the spot on which it is built is so confined, that it cannot be convenient. Only two rooms are designed for work and lodging for both sexes; and as there is no court, the sewers must make these rooms very unhealthy. It might have been better if the Gentlemen had thought of building the bridewell in one of the two very spacious gardens adjoining to the county gaol, and occupied by the gaoler; then, if they had no chapel, the prisoners (as those in Shrewsbury bridewell) might have the privilege of public worship in the county gaol.

HEREFORD CITY GAOL.

No alteration.

1779, May 17, Debtors 4. Felons &c. none.

MONMOUTHSHIRE.

[Monmouthshire.]

COUNTY GAOL at MONMOUTH.

No alteration. Ten of the twelve felons &c. were convicts, four of them at the summer assize in 1775.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at USK.

The rooms that are now building will be some small improvement of this prison. The prisoners have some allowance. The spinning-

wheels, &c. are not provided by the county. The keeper has all the profit of the work.

1779, June 8, Prisoners 7.

MONMOUTH TOWN GAOL.

A room on the first floor for debtors, and another over it for felons. No court: no water. Allowance to felons, two pence a day. Gaoler's salary, £4.

1779, June 2, No prisoners.

GLOUCESTERSHIRE.

[Gloucestershire.]

COUNTY GAOL, GLOUCESTER CASTLE.

No alteration. Eight prisoners died about Christmas 1778, of the small pox. No proper separation of the sexes, or of the bridewell prisoners from the rest. From the magistrates inattention to this important point, there is the most licentious intercourse; and all the endeavours of the chaplain to promote reformation, must necessarily be defeated, where the most abandoned are daily encouraging the others in vice. Five or six children have lately been born in this gaol.

Eleven of the twenty-four felons were fines without any allowance. Clauses of act against spirituous liquors, and the act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up.

1779, June 1, Debtors 16. Felons &c. 24.

CIRENCESTER. No alteration. 1779, June 9, Prisoners 6.

WINCHCOMB. No alteration. The prison quite ruinous.

The old keeper is dead, and his nephew (who is now keeper) said, that "he should be obliged to put irons on all the prisoners to secure them."

1779, May 19, Prisoners none.

St. BRIAVELL's GAOL for debtors.

No alteration.

1779. June 2, No prisoners.

GLOUCESTER CITY and COUNTY GAOL.

No alteration, but white-washed once a year. The city bridewell at the East-gate is now taken down.

LIVERPOOL BRIDEWELL.

This prison was built in 1776. The men and women have separate rooms, courts, &c. The women have six rooms below, and the same number above: the men have four rooms below, and four above. These are twelve feet by ten; are furnished with bedsteads; but are too close, having no window, only an aperture in the door about nine inches square, and another near the ceiling. They have a large work-room, in which was only one boy. Near this room in the men's court is a pump, to which the women are tied every week and receive discipline. In this court is also a bath, with a new and singular contrivance. At one end of it is a standard for a long pole, at the extremity of which is fastened a chair. In this all the females (not the males) at their entrance, after a few questions, are placed, with a flannel Shift on, and undergo a thorough ducking, thrice repeated - an use of a bath which I dare say the legislature never thought of, when in their late act they ordered baths with a view to cleanliness and preserving the health of prisoners; not for the exercise of a wanton and dangerous kind of severity. The women were employed in picking oakum. Allowance, two pennyworth of bread a day. Keeper's salary, £30. Matron, £10.

CONCLUSION.

HAVING thus, according to my ability, completed the design I had engaged in, it was my intention immediately to have retired to the tranquil enjoyment of that easy competence a kind Providence has bestowed upon me: - happy in the idea, that I had in some degree been the instrument of alleviating the sufferings of a numerous and unhappy set of people, and had excited the attention of my countrymen to an important object of civil policy. May I be permitted, too, to say, that I felt additional satisfaction, in having avoided giving any possible occasion to impute what I had done to self-interested views. For as nothing but a consciousness of duty could have enabled me to go through all the disagreeable scenes which lay in my way, so I had the happiness of being placed out of the reach of any other incitements.

My resolution of resigning all further public concern in this matter was, however, broken in upon by the urgent persuasions of some, who were pleased to think me a proper person to assist in the

CONCLUSION. 195

superintendence of one of those great and useful plans I had recommended to the notice of the public. I was the more readily induced to comply with their felicitations, from a confidence that the persons associated with me had the same general ideas with myself respecting the execution of the proposed plan, and would co-operate in it with the greatest zeal and intelligence.

It remains now to be tried, how far the wise and humane intentions of the legislature can be accomplished in this country; and in what degree we can avail ourselves of those lights, which it was the particular purpose of my foreign journeys to collect.

TABLE IV.

An Account of the Number of Prisoners in the Gaols and Prisons of England and Wales, at the Time they were visited in 1779.

AS some County gaols are also the county bridewells, where petty offenders are not always separated from felons; in those places I include petty offenders under the article felons &c. The reason of my distinguishing the women debtors, is to shew that a room or two in the gaoler's house may probably be sufficient for them, instead of a separate ward, as proposed in my general plan for a county gaol (edit. 1.) I have omitted mentioning all those prisons in which, at the time of my visiting, there were no persons confined.

Though I have visited all the County gaols, and I think all the County bridewells, as also many of the corporation and private-property prisons, yet as there are some few of the two latter which I did not see in 1779, we may add sixty more prisoners on their account; and then probably we shall have nearly the average number of persons confined at one time in the prisons of this kingdom.
