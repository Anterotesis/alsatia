INTRODUCTION.

THE distress of prisoners, of which there are few who have not some imperfect idea, came more immediately under my notice when I was Sheriff of the county of Bedford*; and the circumstance which excited me to activity in their behalf was, the seeing some, who by the verdict of juries were declared not guilty; some, on whom the grand jury did not find such an appearance of guilt as subjected them to trial; and some, whose prosecutors did not appear against them; after having been confined for months, dragged back to gaol, and locked up again till they should pay sundry fees to the gaoler, the clerk of assize, &c.

* In 1773.

2 INTRODUCTION.

In order to redress this hardship, I applied to the justices of the county for a salary to the gaoler in lieu of his fees. The bench were properly affected with the grievance, and willing to grant the relief desired: but they wanted a precedent for charging the county with the expence. I therefore rode into several neighbouring counties in search of a precedent; but I soon learned that the same injustice was practised in them; and looking into the prisons, I beheld scenes of calamity, which I grew daily more and more anxious to alleviate. In order therefore to gain a more perfect knowledge of the particulars and extent of it, by various and accurate observation, I visited most of the County-Gaols in England.

Seeing in two or three of them some poor creatures whose aspect was singularly deplorable, and asking the cause of it, I was answered, “they were lately brought from the Bridewells.” This started a fresh subject of inquiry. I resolved to inspect the Bridewells: and for that purpose I travelled again into the counties where I had been; and, indeed, into all the rest; examining Houses of Correction, City and Town-Gaols. I beheld in many of them, as well as in the County-Gaols, a complication of distress: but my attention was principally fixed by the gaol-fever, and the small-pox, which I saw prevailing to the dedrustion of multitudes, not only of felons in their dungeons, but of debtors also.

INTRODUCTION. 3

The gaol-fever is no new subject of complaint. I remember Stowe, in his Survey*, speaking of the King's-Bench Prison, says, that in the six years preceding the year 1579, an hundred prisoners died there: and twelve between Michaelmass and March of the last-mentioned year, “through a certain contagion called the sickness of the house;“ and I shall presently have occasion, among the fatal effects of this distemper propagated from prisons, and infecting many abroad, to mention an ancient instance of that sort also. These effects are now so notorious, that what terrifies most of us from looking into prisons, is the gaol-distemper so frequent in them.

Upon this subject I was examined in the House of Commons in March 1774; when I had the honour of their thanks. Soon after that, Mr. Popham, Member for Taunton, repeated the humane attempt which had miscarried a few years before; and brought in a bill for the relief of prisoners who should be acquitted, respecting their fees; and another bill for preserving the health of prisoners, and preventing the gaol-distemper. They both passed that sessions. By those acts, the tear was wiped from many an eye; and the legislature had for them “the blessing of many that were ready to perish."

* Vol. II. p. 18.

4 INTRODUCTION.

The great honour done me by the House has excited the curiosity of some to inquire what facts I had collected. This is one reason of the present publication: but it is not the only, nor the principal one. There are still remaining many disorders that ought to be rectified: prisoners suffer great hardships, from which I am desirous to set them free: the gaol-fever is not, as I am persuaded it may be, totally eradicated. These are my motives for printing this book. I think it will shew plainly, that much is yet to be done for the regulation of prisons; and I am not without hope, that the present Parliament will finish what was so laudably begun by the last.

I was called to the first part of my task by my office. To the pursuit of it I was prompted by the sorrows of the sufferers, and love to my country. The work grew upon me insensibly. I could not enjoy my ease and leisure in the neglect of an opportunity offered me by Providence of attempting the relief of the miserable. The attention of Parliament to the subject, led me to conclude that some additional labour would not be lost; and I extended my plan. The difficulty I found in searching out evidence of fraud and cruelty in various articles, together with other sources of distress, obliged me to repeat my visits, and travel over the kingdom more than once; and after all, I suspect that many frauds have been concealed from me; and that sometimes the interest of my informants prevailed over their veracity.

INTRODUCTION. 5

Besides; as I had in my first journeys gathered, from facts and experience, proofs of the mischievous effects of the want of cleanliness and fresh air, I had in my latter visits these strong arguments to enforce my persuasions; and, in consequence, some gaolers grew at last more mindful and complying, for the sake not only of their prisoners, but of themselves and their own families.

It was not, I own, without some apprehensions of danger, when I first visited the prisons; and I guarded myself by smelling to vinegar, while I was in those places, and changing my apparel afterwards. This I did condantly and carefully when I began; but by degrees I grew less cautious: not only because use abated the force of noxious impressions upon me, but also on account of the alteration made in some gaols by the act for preserving the health of prisoners. A person may now look into many a prison without gaining an idea of the condition it was in a few years ago. I wish the reformation to be not for the present only, but lasting. If the motive for amendment has any where been merely temporary, there is no doubt but the effect will cease with the cause: those who from such inducement have obeyed, will in future follow the example of others who have disregarded the law; and prisons that have been amended will relapse into their former state.

6 INTRODUCTION.

As to what is still wrong, I set down matter of fact without amplification; which would in the end rather impede than promote the object of my wishes; that is, the correction of what is really amiss.

The journies were not undertaken for the traveller's amusement; and the collections are not published for general entertainment; but for the perusal of those who have it in their power to give redress to the sufferers.

The writer begs his reader to excuse the frequent egotisms which he did not know how to avoid, without using circumlocutions that might have been more disgusting.

SECTION I.

GENERAL VIEW OF DISTRESS IN PRISONS.

THERE are prisons, into which whoever looks will, at first sight of the people confined there, be convinced, that there is some great error in the management of them: the fallow meagre countenances declare, without words, that they are very miserable: many who went in healthy, are in a few months changed to emaciated dejected objects. Some are seen pining under diseases, “sick and in prison,” expiring on the floors, in loathsome cells, of pestilential fevers, and the confluent small-pox: victims, I must not say to the cruelty, but I will say to the inattention, of sheriffs, and gentlemen in the commission of the peace.

The cause of this distress is, that many prisons are scantily supplied, and some almost totally unprovided with the necessaries of life.

8 GENERAL VIEW OF

[Food.]

THERE are several Bridewells (to begin with them) in which prisoners have no allowance of food at all. In some, the keeper farms what little is allowed them: and where he engages to supply each prisoner with one or two pennyworth of bread a day, I have known this shrunk to half, sometimes less than half the quantity, cut or broken from his own loaf.

It will perhaps be asked, does not their work maintain them? for every one knows that those offenders are committed to hard labour. The answer to that question, though true, will hardly be believed. There are very few Bridewells in which any work is done, or can be done. The prisoners have neither tools, nor materials of any kind; but spend their time in sloth, profaneness and debauchery, to a degree which, in some of those houses that I have seen, is extremely shocking.

Some keepers of these houses, who have represented to the magistrates the wants of their prisoners, and desired for them necessay food, have been silenced with these inconsiderate words, Let them work or starve. When those gentlemen know the former is impossible, do they not by that sentence, inevitably doom poor creatures to the latter?

I have asked some keepers, since the late act for preserving

Sect. I. DISTRESS IN PRISONS. 9

the health of prisoners, why no care is taken of their sick: and have been answered, that the magistrates tell them the act does not extend to Bridewells*.

In consequence of this, at the quarter sessions you see prisoners, covered (hardly covered) with rags; almost famished; and sick of diseases, which the discharged spread wherever they go, and with which those who are sent to the County-Gaols infect these prisons.

The same complaint, want of food, is to be found in many county-gaols. In about half these, debtors have no bread; although it is granted to the highwayman, the house-breaker, and the murderer; and medical assistance, which is provided for the latter, is withheld from the former. In many of these Gaols, debtors who would work are not permitted to have any tools, lest they should furnish felons with them for escape or other mischief. I have often seen those prisoners eating their water-soup (bread boiled in mere water) and heard them say, “We are locked up and almost starved to death.”

As to the relief provided for Debtors by the benevolent

* If the late act does not include Bridewells, it is required, by an act 7th James I. Cap. IV. that “the Masters and Governors of .... Houses of Correction shall have some fit allowance .... for the relieving of such as shall happen to be weak and sick in their custody.”

10 GENERAL VIEW OF

act, 32d of George II. (commonly called the lords act, because it originated in their house) I did not find in all England and Wales (except the counties of Middlesex and Surrey) twelve debtors who had obtained from their creditors the four-pence a day, to which they had a right by that act: the means of procuring it were out of their reach. In one of my journeys I found near six hundred prisoners, whose debts were under twenty pounds each: some of them did not owe above three or four pounds: and the expence of sueing for the aliment is in many places equal to those smaller debts for which some of these prisoners had been confined several months.

At Carlisle but one debtor of the forty-nine whom I saw there had obtained his groats: and the gaoler told me that during the time he had held that office, which was fourteen years, no more than four or five had received it; and that they were soon discharged by their creditors neglecting to pay it. No one debtor had the aliment in York Castle, Devon, Cheshire, Kent, and many other counties. The truth is, some debtors are the most pitiable objects in our gaols.

To their wanting necessary food, I mult add not only the demands of gaolers, &c. for fees; but also the extortion of bailiffs. These detain in their houses (properly enough denominated spunging-houses) at an enormous expence, prisoners

Sect. I. DISTRESS IN PRISONS.

who have money. I know there is a legal provision against this oppression; but the mode of obtaining redress (like that of recovering the groats) is attended with difficulty: and the abuse continues. The rapine of these extortioners needs some more effectual and easy check: no bailiff should be suffered to keep a public house*; the mischiefs occasioned by their so doing, are complained of in many parts of the kingdom.

Here I beg leave to mention the hard case of prisoners confined on exchequer processes; and those from the ecclesiastical courts: the latter are excluded from the privilege of bail; and the former from the benefit of insolvent acts.

Felons have in some Gaols two pennyworth of bread a day; in some three halfpennyworth; in some a pennyworth; in some a shilling a week: the particulars will be seen hereafter in their proper places. I often weighed the bread in different prisons, and found the penny loaf 7½ to 8½ ounces, the other loaves in proportion. It is probable that when this allowance was fixed by its value, near double the quantity that the money will now purchase, might be bought for

* By the statute 32d George II. it is enacted, that “No sheriff, bailiff, &c. .... shall convey any person arrested .... to any public victualling or other drinkinghouse .... without the consent of the person so arrested.” Now if the bailiff himself keeps a public house, this seems to preclude the debtor's choice; he must go to a public house, or directly to gaol.

12 GENERAL VIEW OF

it: yet the allowance continues unaltered: and it is not uncommon to see the whole purchase, especially of the smaller sums, eaten at breakfast: which is sometimes the case when they receive their pittance but once in two days; and then on the following day they must fast.

This allowance being so far short of the cravings of nature, and in some prisons lessened by farming to the gaoler, many criminals are half starved: such of them as at their commitment were in health, come out almost famished, scarce able to move, and for weeks incapable of any labour.

[Water.]

Many prisons have no water. This defect is frequent in Bridewells, and Town-Gaols. In the felons courts of some County-Gaols there is no water: in some places where there is water, prisoners are always locked up within doors, and have no more than the keeper or his servants think fit to bring them: in one place they are limited to three pints a day each — a scanty provision for drink and cleanliness

[Air.]

And as to air, which is no less necessary than either of

the two preceding articles, and given us by Providence quite gratis, without any care or labour of our own; yet, as if the bounteous goodness of Heaven excited our envy, methods are contrived to rob prisoners of this genuine cordial of life, as Dr. Hales very properly calls it: I mean by preventing

Sect. I. DISTRESS IN PRISONS. 13

that circulation and change of the salutiferous fluid, without which animals cannot live and thrive. It is well known that air which has performed its office in the lungs, is feculent and noxious. Writers upon the subject shew, that a hogshead of it will last a man only an hour: but those who do not choose to consult philosophers, may judge from a notorious fact. In 1756, at Calcutta in Bengal, out of 170 persons who were confined in a hole there one night, 154 were taken out dead. The few survivors ascribed the mortality to their want of fresh air, and called the place, from what they suffered there, Hell in miniature!

Air which has been breathed, is made poilonous to a more intense degree by the effluvia from the sick, and what else in prisons is offensive. My reader will judge of its malignity, when I assure him, that my cloaths were in my first journeys so offensive, that in a post-chaise I could not bear the windows drawn up: and was therefore often obliged to travel on horseback. The leaves of my memorandum-book were often so tainted, that I could not use it till after spreading it an hour or two before the fire: and even my antidote, a vial of vinegar, has after using it in a few prisons, become intolerably disagreeable. I did not wonder that in those journies many gaolers made excuses, and did not go with me into the felons wards*.

* I learn from a Letter to Sir Robert Ladbroke, printed in 1771, page 11, that “Dr. Hales, Sir John Pringle, and others have observed, that air, corrupted

14 GENERAL VIEW OF

From hence any one may judge of the probability there is against the health and life of prisoners, crowded in close rooms, cells, and subterraneous dungeons, for fourteen or sixteen hours out of the four and twenty. In some of those caverns the floor is very damp: in others there is sometimes an inch or two of water; and the straw, or bedding is laid on such floors, seldom on barrack bedsteads. Where prisoners are not kept in underground cells, they are often confined to their rooms, because there is no court* belonging to the prison, which is the case in most City and Town-Gaols: or because the walls round the yard are ruinous, or too low for safety: or because the gaoler has the ground for his own use. Prisoners confined in this manner, are generally unhealthy.

[Sewers.]

Some Gaols have no sewers; and in those that have, if they be not properly attended to, they are, even to a visitant, offensive beyond expression: how noxious then to people constantly confined in those prisons!

One cause why the rooms in some prisons are so close,

“and putrified, is of such a subtil and powerful nature, as to rot and dissolve heart of oak; and that the walls of buildings have been impregnated with this poisonous matter for years together.” The writer quotes for his authority a letter of Sir Stephen Theodore Janssen, which I have not been able to procure.

* An act made in Ireland the 3d year of his present Majesty, “for better preventing the severities, &c.” has the following clause: “Whereas many infectious disorders are daily produced by the confinement of numbers in close prisons, whereunto there is no back-yard adjoining, and the lives of his Majesty's subjects are endangered by the bringing of prisoners into public streets for air; Be it

Sect. I. DISTRESS IN PRISONS. 15

is perhaps the window-tax, which the gaolers have to pay: this tempts them to flop the windows, and stifle their prisoners*.

[Bedding.]

In many Gaols, and in most Bridewells, there is no allowance of straw for prisoners to sleep on; and if by any means they get a little, it is not changed for months together, so that it is almost worn to dust. Some lie upon rags, others upon the bare floors. When I have complained of this to the keepers, their justification has been, “The county allows no straw, the prisoners have none but at my cost.”

[Morals.]

THE evils mentioned hitherto affect the health and life of prisoners: I have now to complain of what is pernicious to their morals and that is, the confining all sorts of prisoners together: debtors and felons , men and women; the young beginner and the old offender: and with all these, in

“enacted .... That every grand jury at the assizes or quarter sessions .... may be enabled, and they are hereby required and directed, to contract either by lease, or to purchase a piece of ground next adjoining the Gaol, or as near as conveniently can be had thereto, &c."

* This is also the case in many work-houses and farm-houses, where the poor and the labourer are lodged in rooms that have no light, nor fresh air: which may be a cause of our peasants not having the healthy ruddy complexions one used to see so common twenty or thirty years ago. The difference has often struck me in my various journeys.

16 GENERAL VIEW OF

some counties, such as are guilty of misdemeanors only; who should have been committed to Bridewell, to be corrected by diligence and labour; but for want of food, and the means of procuring it in those prisons, are in pity sent to such County-Gaols as afford these offenders prison-allowance.

Few prisons separate men and women in the day-time. In some counties the Gaol is also the Bridewell; in others those prisons are contiguous, and the yard common. There the petty offender is committed for instruction to the most profligate. In some Gaols you see (and who can see it without pain?) boys of twelve or fourteen eagerly listening to the stories told by practised and experienced criminals, of their adventures, successes, stratagems, and escapes.

I must here add, that in some few Gaols are confined idiots and lunatics. These serve for sport to idle visitants at assizes, and other times of general resort. The insane, where they are not kept separate, disturb and terrify other prisoners. No care is taken of them, although it is probable that by medicines, and proper regimen, some of them might be restored to their senses, and to usefulness in life.

[Gaol-Fever.]

I AM ready to think, that none who give credit to what is contained in the foregoing pages, will wonder at the havock made by the gaol-fever. From my own observations

Sect. I. DISTRESS IN PRISONS. 17

in 1773 and 1774, I was fully convinced that many more were destroyed by it, than were put to death by all the public executions in the kingdom *. This frequent effect of confinement in prison seems generally understood, and shews how full of emphatical meaning is the curse of a severe creditor, who pronounces his debtor's doom to rot in gaol. I believe I have learned the full import of this sentence, from the vast numbers who to my certain knowledge, some of them before my eyes, have perished in our Gaols.

But the mischief is not confined to prisons. Not to mention now the number of Jailors, and of families in America, that have been infected by transports, since this mode of punishment is by a late act suspended. Multitudes catch the distemper by going to their relatives and acquaintance in the Gaols: many others from prisoners discharged: and not a few in the courts of judicature.

In Baker's Chronicle, page 353, that historian mentioning the Assize held in Oxford Castle 1577 (called from its

* I have a Table printed From a large copper-plate, 1772, by Sir Stephen Theodore Janssen, shewing the number of malefactors executed in London for the twenty-three preceding years; and the crimes for which they suffered. I will give an abridgement of it in two tables at the end of the book, In them it will be seen, that the total number of executions in London for those twenty-three years, was 678; the annual average is between 29 and 30. I leave to others the discussion of the question, whether those executions were too numerous, whether all the crimes

fatal consequence the Black Assize) informs us, that “all who were present died within forty hours: the Lord Chief Baron, the Sheriff, and about three hundred more.” Lord Chancellor Bacon ascribes this to a disease brought into court by the prisoners; and Dr. Mead is of the same opinion.

The first of these two authors, Lord Bacon, observes, that “the most pernicious infection next the plague, is the smell of the jail; when the prisoners have been long and close and nastily kept: whereof we have had, in our time, experience twice or thrice; when both the judges that sat upon the jail, and numbers of those who attended the business, or were present, sickened upon it and died.”*

At the Lent Assize in Taunton, 1730, some prisoners who were brought thither from Ivelchester Gaol, infected the court; and Lord Chief Baron Pengelly; Sir James Sheppard, Serjeant; John Pigot, Esq. Sheriff, and some hundreds besides, died of the gaol-distemper. At Axminster,

for which it was inflicted (many of which will be distinctly set down) were deserving of death. And it may be left to any one to judge, whether, including debtors and petty offenders, the number of those that died in the several London prisons of the Gaol-Fever, does not exceed the number of those that were executed annually during that time. — I have not the number of executions in all the counties, but am well assured it falls still much shorter of the number that perished in prisons.

* Natural History, Exp. 914.

SECT. I. DISTRESS IN PRISONS. 19

a little town in Devonshire, a prisoner discharged from Exeter Gaol in 1755, infected his family with that disease: of which two of them died; and many others in that town afterwards. The numbers that were carried off by the same malady in London in 1750, two judges, the lord mayor, one alderman, and many of inferior rank, are too well known to need the mentioning further particulars.

Sir John Pringle observes, that “jails have often been the cause of malignant fevers;” and he informs us, that in the late rebellion in Scotland, above 200 men of one regiment were infected with the jail-fever, by some deserters brought from prisons in England*.

Dr. Lind, Physician to the Royal Hospital at Haslar, near Portsmouth, shewed me in one of the wards a number of sailors ill of the gaol-fever; brought on board their Ship by a man who had been discharged from a prison in London. The Ship was laid up on the occasion. That gentleman, in his Essay on the Health of Seamen, asserts, that “The source of infection to our armies and fleets are undoubtedly the jails; we can often trace the importers of it directly from them. It often proves fatal in impressing men on the hasty equipment of a fleet†. The first

* Observations on the Diseases of the Army, p. 296, and 47.

† Page 307.

20 GENERAL VIEW OF

“English fleet sent last war to America, lost by it above 2000 men.” In another place he assures us, that “the seeds of infection were carried from the guard-ships into our squadrons — and the mortality, thence occasioned, was greater than by all other diseases or means of death put together.”*

It were easy to multiply instances of this mischief; but those which have been mentioned are, I presume, sufficient to shew, even if no mercy were due to prisoners, that the Gaol-Distemper is a national concern of no small importance.

[Vicious Examples.]

THE general prevalence and spread of wickedness in prisons, and abroad by the discharged prisoners, will now be as easily accounted for, as the propagation of disease. It is often said, “A prison pays no debts;” I am sure it may be added, that a prison mends no morals. Sir John Fielding observes, that “a criminal discharged — generally by the next sessions after the execution of his comrades, becomes the head of a gang of his own raising.” Improved, no doubt, in skill by the company he kept in gaol: and petty offenders who are committed to Bridewell for a year or two, and spend that time, not in hard labour, but in idleness and wicked company, or are sent for that time to County-Gaols,

* Page 5.

SECT. I. DISTRESS IN PRISONS. 21

generally grow desperate, and come out fitted, for the perpetration of any villainy. How directly contrary this to the intention of our laws with regard to these offenders; which certainly is to correct and reform them! Instead of which, their confinement doth notoriously promote and increase the very vices it was designed to suppress. Multitudes of young creatures, committed for some trifling offence, are totally ruined there. I make no scruple to affirm, that if it were the wish and aim of Magistrates to effect the destruction present and future of young delinquents, they could not devise a more effectual method, than to confine them so long in our prisons, those seats and seminaries (as they have been very properly called) of idleness and every vice.

Shall these irregularities, the sources of misery, disease, and wickedness, be endured in a nation celebrated for good sense and humanity; and who from these principles, do treat one sort of prisoners with tenderness and generality? I mean prisoners of war. These have provision in plenty; some to spare and sell to the soldiers on guard*: we frequently saw

* The daily allowance to six prisoners was,

9 pounds of bread,

4½_ pounds of beef,

3 pints of pease,

6 quarts of beer,

Water plenty.

On Friday they had not the beef; but a pound and half of butter instead of it.

On board the men of war, indeed, they were upon short allowance.

22 GENERAL VIEW OF

their stated allowance hung up for their inspection. Some prisons had large areas for them to walk in; and at night every man had a hammock to himself. It is the farthest thing in the world from my wish to deprive captives of any one of these benefits — I am only desirous of seeing the same humanity shown to our own countrymen in distress; so that a consistent and uniform practice may prove our benevolence to be a firm and steady principle; and that those who are censorious may find no occasion for ascribing our kind usage of foreigners to a less amiable motive.

Here it will be said, prisoners of war are not felons, nor yet debtors; and government is sometimes at the end of a war, reimbursed the expence of maintaining them. This latter I believe is fact; and the former is true without dispute: we do not look upon foreign enemies, nor they upon us*, as delinquents: we cut one another to pieces in battle,

* I must not be understood to mean here a compliment to the French. How they treat English prisoners of war, I knew by experience in 1756; when a Lisbon packet (the Hanover) in which I went passenger, in order to make the tour of Portugal, was taken by a French privateer. Before we reached Brest, I suffered the extremity of thirst, not having for above forty hours one drop of water; nor hardly a morsel of food. In the castle at Brest, I lay six nights upon straw: and observing how cruelly my countrymen were used there, and at Morlaix, whither I was carried next; during the two months I was at Carhaix upon parole, I corresponded with the English prisoners at Brest, Morlaix, and Dinnan: at the last of those towns were several of our ship's crew, and my servant. I had sufficient evidence of their being treated with such barbarity, that many hundreds had perished;

SECT. I. DISTRESS IN PRISONS. 23

but when that is over we grow cool and compassionate. I grant there is a material difference in the circumstances of foreign and domestic prisoners, but there is none in their nature: debtors and felons, as well as hostile foreigners, are men, and by men they ought to be treated as men.

Those gentlemen who, when they are told of the misery which our prisoners suffer, content themselves with saying, Let them take care to keep out, prefaced perhaps, with an angry prayer, seem not duly sensible of the favour of Providence which distinguishes them from the sufferers: they do not remember that we are required to imitate our gracious Heavenly Parent, who is “kind to the unthankful and the evil." They also forget the vicissitudes of human affairs; the unexpected changes to which all men are liable; and that those whose circumstances are affluent, may in time be reduced to indigence, and become debtors and prisoners.

and that thirty-six were buried in a hole at Dinnan in one day. When I came to England, still on parole, I made known to the Commissioners of sick and wounded seamen, the sundry particulars; which gained their attention, and thanks. Remonstrance was made to the French court: our sailors had redress: and those that were in the three prisons mentioned above, were brought home in the first cartel ships. — A Lady from Ireland, who married in France, had bequeathed in trust with the magistrates of St. Malo's, sundry charities; one of which was a penny a day to every English prisoner of war in Dinnan. This was duly paid; and saved the lives of many brave and useful men. Perhaps what I suffered on this occasion, increased my sympathy with the unhappy people, whose case is the subject of this book.

24 GENERAL VIEW, &c.

But it may be said, enough of the declamatory kind has been written by others. Much it is true, has been written: yet I beg leave to transcribe, a few lines from a celebrated author, which may be thought to come under that description. After representing the calamitous case of prisoners, he goes on to this purpose, “The misery of Gaols is not half their evil; they are filled with every corruption which poverty and wickedness can generate between them; with all the shameless and profligate enormities that can be produced by the impudence of ignominy, the rage of want, and the malignity of despair. In a prison the awe of the public eye is lost, and the power of the law is spent; there are few fears, there are no blushes. The lewd inflame the lewd, the audacious harden the audacious. Every one fortifies himself as he can against his own sensibility, endeavours to practise on others the arts which are practised on himself; and gains the kindness of his associates by similitude of manners.”*

BESIDES the grievances already mentioned; there are several bad customs in Gaols, and relating to them, which aggravate the distress of prisoners. I shall enumerate these distinctly, yet concisely.

* The Idler, No. 38.

SECTION II.

BAD CUSTOMS IN PRISONS.

[Garnish.]

A CRUEL custom obtains in most of our Gaols, which is that of the prisoners demanding of a new comer Garnish, Footing, or (as it is called in some London Gaols) Chummage. “Pay or strip,” are the fatal words. I say fatal, for they are so to some; who having no money, are obliged to give up part of their scanty apparel; and if they have no bedding or straw to sleep on, contract diseases, which I have known to prove mortal.

In many Gaols, to the Garnish paid by the new comer, those who were there before make an addition; and great part of the following night is often spent in riot and drunkenness. The gaoler or tapster finding his account in this practice, generally answers questions concerning it with reluctance. Of the Garnish which I have set down to sundry

prisons, I often had my information from prisoners who paid it. But I am aware that the sum is sometimes varied by sets of succeeding prisoners, and the different circumstances of a new comer. In some Gaols, if a Felon can pay the Debtor's Garnish (which is commonly more than that of the Felons) he is entitled to partake of the Garnish paid afterwards by new-come Debtors. In some places, this demand has been lately waved: in others, strictly prohibited by the Magistrates.

[Gaming.]

Gaming in various forms is very frequent: cards, dice, skittles, Missisippi and Portobello tables, billiards, fives, tennis, &c. In the country the three first are most common; and especially cards. There is scarce a County-Gaol but is furnished with them: and one can seldom go in without seeing prisoners at play. In London, all the sorts that I have named are in use. I am not an enemy to diverting exercise: yet the riot, brawling, and profaneness, that are the usual consequents of their play; the circumstances of debtors gaming away the property of their creditors, which I know they have done in some prisons to a considerable amount; accomplishing themselves in the frauds of gamblers, who, if they be not themselves prisoners, are fare to haunt where gaming is practised; hindering their fellow-prisoners who do not play from walking in the yards while they do, of which inconvenience I have heard them complain: these seem to me cogent reasons for prohibiting

Sect. II. BAD CUSTOMS. 27

all kinds of gaming within the walls of a prison.

[Irons.]

Loading prisoners with heavy irons, which make their walking, and even lying down to sleep, difficult and painful, is another custom which I cannot but condemn. In some County-Gaols the women do not escape this severity: but in London they do: and therefore it is not necessary in the country. The practice must be mere tyranny; unless it proceed from avarice; which I rather suspect; because county-gaolers do sometimes grant dispensations, and indulge their prisoners, men as well as women, with what they call “the choice of irons,” if they will pay for it.

The author of the letter to Sir Robert Ladbroke on prisons (particularly on Newgate, which was then to be rebuilt) cites in page 79, the opinion of Lord Coke, Horn's Mirror of Justice, &c. against this oppression and adds afterwards, “The learned editor of Hale's History of the Pleas of the Crown likewise declares, that fetters ought not to be used, unless there is just reason to fear an escape, as where the prisoner is unruly, or makes an attempt to that purpose; otherwise, notwithstanding the common practice of gaolers, it seems altogether unwarrantable, and contrary to the mildness and humanity of the laws of England, by which gaolers are forbid to put their prisoners to any pain or torment.”

28 BAD CUSTOMS.

The Gentlemen of the Gaol-Committee, who distinguished themselves by an accurate and zealous inquiry into the abuses practised by gaolers*; in their Report concerning the Fleet Prison, 20th March 1728, after mentioning a petition presented to the Judges by one who had been put in irons by the Wardens, inform us, that the Judges reprimanded the Wardens, and declared, that “a gaoler could not answer the ironing of a man before he was found guilty of a crime.” — To the plea which gaolers use in defence of this practice, that “It is necessary for safe custody,” an answer may be given in the words of Lord Chief Justice King (afterwards Lord Chancellor) to the Wardens of the same prison, when he forbade dungeons, which they had made use of. That Judge declared, “they might raise their walls higher, &c.” See the Report of the same Committee.

To what Lord King suggested of raising the walls, one might presume to add — The number of turnkeys should be increased in proportion to the number of prisoners*.

The Marquis Beccaria, in his Essay on Crimes and Punishments, page 75, observes that Imprisonment being “only the means of securing the person of the accused, until he be tried — ought — to be attended with as little severity as possible.” The distress occasioned by chains is increased by

[Varying Towns.]

Varying the towns where Quarter Sessions and Assizes are held: so that prisoners have to walk in irons ten or fifteen miles to their trial: and sometimes to towns that have no prison: where numbers of both sexes are shut up together for many days and nights in one room. This occasions

* If the daring character of our felons should seem, after all, to make it necessary to confine them in irons, it would be right, at least, to bring them into court for their trial without irons. When I was in Scotland, I was informed that every prisoner there was tried out of irons, and when acquitted, discharged in open court.

30 BAD CUSTOMS.

such confusion and distress, and such shrieks and outcries, as can be better conceived than described. Surely prisoners ought to be conveyed in carts; or else committed at first to the town where the Sessions or Assizes are to be held. And in that town a proper prison ought to be built.

[Gaol Delivery.]

Gaol Delivery is in some, counties but once a year. What reparation can be made to a poor creature for the misery he has suffered by confinement in a prison near twelve months (sometimes twice as long) before a trial, in which perhaps he is at last declared by his country not guilty?

The judicious Marquis whom I quoted but now asserts, that “Privation of liberty being a punishment, ought not to be inflicted before condemnation, but for as short a time as possible.” And in cases of guilt, his doctrine is, “The more immediately after the commission of a crime, a punishment is inflicted, the more just and useful it will be.” This sentiment is illustrated by a variety of acute remarks in the chapter of the Advantage of immediate Punishment.

One cause of Gaol Delivery being so seldom, is in some places the expence of entertaining the Judges and their retinue. At Hull they used to have the Assize but once in

Sect. II. BAD CUSTOMS. 31

seven years. Peacock a murderer was in prison there near three years: before his trial the principal witness died; and the criminal was acquitted. They now have it once in three years.

Although acquitted prisoners are by the late act in their favour* cleared of Gaolers Fees;

[Clerks of Assize, &c.]

they are still subject to a similar demand made by clerks of assize and clerks of the peace†; and detained in prison several days after their acquittal — at Assize, till the Judges — at Quarter Sessions, till the Justices of Peace leave the town; in order to obtain those fees, which the gentlemen say are not cancelled by the act. And yet the express words of it are, Acquitted prisoners “shall be immediately let at large in open court.”

Since the said act the Clerks of Assize in some circuits have started a new demand upon the gaoler for the Judges

* 14th George III.

† See the Table of the Fees of the Clerk of Assize at the end of the book. The Clerk of the Peace in one county demands as follows:

certificate of acquitment; viz. six shillings and eight-pence for the first prisoner acquitted; and a shilling for each of the rest or two shillings for every one. I know some of these gentlemen do not make any such demand. Where it is made, some gaolers refuse to pay it; others submit murmuring. I have copies of two receipts given by the Clerk of the Western circuit to the gaolers of Exeter and Salisbury*.

I was informed at Durham, that Judge Gould at the Assize 1775 laid a fine of fifty pounds on the gaoler for detaining some acquitted prisoners, for the fees of the Clerk of Assize. But upon the intercession of the Bishop (proprietor of the Gaol) the fine was remitted, and the prisoners set at large: the Judge ordering the Clerk of Assize to explain to him in London the foundation of his demand.

One pretence for detaining acquitted prisoners is, that “It is possible other indictments may be laid against them

* One of them is as follows.

“RECEIVED 1 April 1775 of Mr. Sherry gaoler one pound eight shillings and 8 pence for his certificate entitling him to his gaol fees for the county of Devon

per

Clerk of the Assize.“

The gaoler told me this was for twenty-three acquitted prisoners.

BAD CUSTOMS. 33

“before the Judge leaves the town.” I call it a pretence, because it is often waved upon paying the fees. Another is, the gaoler tells you, “He takes them back to knock off their irons.” But this may be done in court: in London they have an engine or block, by the help of which they take off the irons with ease in a minute or two; the machine is brought into court, and the acquitted prisoner is immediately discharged. If, according to what I formerly proposed, prisoners were tried out of irons, this pretext would be entirely removed.

Clerks of Assize, and of the Peace, ought most certainly to have a consideration for their service to the public: and I do not wish to lessen many other emoluments of those gentlemen. The only thing I complain of is, what I am led to by my subject, the demand that is made directly or indirectly upon prisoners.

[Gaolers Non-resident.]

Some gaolers live distant from the prison, in houses that do not belong to the county. Non-residence is not consistent with the attention that is requisite for securing the prisoners; and preserving good order, cleanliness, &c.

[Wives and Children.]

Debtors crowd the Gaols (especially those in London) with their wives and children. There are often by this means, ten or twelve people in a middle-sized room: increasing the danger of infection, and corrupting the morals

34 BAD CUSTOMS.

of children. This point ought (no doubt) to be treated with tenderness. Man and wife should not be totally separated. Yet the little probability there is of an industrious woman being of much service to her family in a prison: the number of men in the same room; and of lewd women admitted under the name of wives, prove that this affair needs some regulation.

[Gaols Private Property.]

Some Gaols are private property: in these the keepers, protected by the proprietors, and not so subject as other gaolers to the controul of magistrates, are more apt to abuse their prisoners, when a temptation offers. One of these Gaols some years ago was quite out of repair, and unsafe; and the proprietor not choosing to repair it, the gaoler to confine his prisoners took a method, that to all who saw it was really shocking. Some years before that, a prisoner in another of these Gaols was tormented with thumb-screws. The grand jury took up the case, and remonstrated to the proprietor; but in vain. I had the account from a worthy friend of mine, who was upon that very jury.

OF the complaints which I have hitherto made only in general terms, I shall give instances in the account of particular prisons. To that account I refer, for evidence and fact.

Sect. II 35

NUMBER OF PRISONERS.

IN the Spring 1776, I summed up carefully the total number of prisoners in the sundry prisons. I have not altered the list since my latter visits, in which I saw the number in several prisons greatly reduced by the insolvent Act. My list was as follows.

Debtors. Felons, &c. Petty Offenders. Total.

1. IN Middlesex, i.e. London and Westminster; together with three prisons in Southwark, viz. the King's-Bench, Marshalsea, and Borough-Compter, - 1274 - 228 - 194 - 1696

2. In the other thirty-nine counties of England, - 752 - 617 - 459 - 1828

3. In the twelve counties of Wales, - 67 - 27 - 0 - 94

4. In City and Town-Gaols, - 344 - 122 - 0 - 466

2437 - 994 - 653 - 4084

Petty Offenders in the Welch County-Goals, blank in the third column, third line, are included in the preceding number of Felons 27: most of the Goals in those counties being also the County-Bridewells.

36 NUMBER OF PRISONERS.

Petty Offenders, blank in third column, fourth line, are included in the number 459 of Petty Offenders in the thirty-nine County-Gaols; and in the number 122, second column fourth line.

All that were in the County-Gaols besides Debtors, I have reckoned in the list of Felons. Although many were Petty Offenders and Fines.

In the third column, under Petty Offenders are included a few Felons occasionally committed to Bridewells.

I have found by carefully examining sundry Gaols, that upon an average two dependants (by which I mean wives and children only*) may be assigned to each man in prison. My computation is confirmed by the account which we have from the Benevolent Society at the Thatched House, October 9th, 1776, as follows. Since their institution in 1772,

Discharged Debtors - 3980

Who had Wives, - 2193

And Children, - 6288

Persons immediately benefited, - 12461

* I do not include Parents, many of whom I have seen sorrowfully attending at prisons, and deeply sharing in the distress arising from the confinement of their children.

Sect. II. NUMBER OF PRISONERS. 37

And by the account from the Bristol Society; who in their list published May 31st, 1775, have

Persons discharged, - 73

Their Wives, - 45

Their Children, - 120

Total, - 238

Each of these totals is considerably larger than the respective products of multiplication by my rule: the first exceeds by 521, the latter by 19. There is indeed commonly a surplus among Debtors; but a deficiency among Felons, &c. reduces the average of Dependants to that which I Rated.

If then to the total number in England and Wales, that is, - 4084

You add twice that number of Dependants, - 8168

The number of the distressed is, - 12252

IT appears from the foregoing Table of Prisoners, that their number has been greatly magnified by conjectural computations; but surely the real number, with that of those partaking their distress, is an object well worthy the farther attention of the Legislature.

IN THE STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT

OF PRISONS.

HOWEVER sanguinary the wish of an angry creditor may be when he arrests and imprisons his debtor, there is no doubt but every one who listens, not to his passions, but to reason, must know, and will own, that it is a flagrant crime to take away the life of a man for debt: and as to felony, a Gaol is not designed for the final punishment even of that; but for the safe custody of the accused to the time of trial; and of convicts till a legal sentence be executed upon them. The laws of England do not suffer private executions. No condemned malefactor may be secretly put to death; nor murdered in a prison directly or indirectly: much less ought those to be destroyed there whose sentence does not affect their life. Their destruction is not only unjust; it is inconsistent with

Sect. III. PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS. 39

prudence and sound policy. They might no doubt be useful at home or abroad; if proper care were taken in prison, to keep them healthy and fit for labour: but certain it is, that many of those who survive their long confinement, are by it rendered incapable of working. Some of them are grievously affected with scorbutic distempers; others have their toes mortified*, or quite rotted from their feet; many instances of which I have seen.

If one who has turned King's Evidence, or has been barely acquitted upon trial, terrified by his narrow escape, seeks for honest employment he is commonly such a sickly miserable object that no one will set him to work. That, I believe, is the principal cause of his being rejected; for there are several sorts of labour that require but little confidence: yet the poor acquitted prisoner shall go from door to door asking for work, in vain. Is it not to be lamented, that every spark of good intention, instead of being cherished, should be thus extinguished? And that the penitent should by an almost irresistible necessity be driven again, though reluctant, to the practice which soon brings him

* Messrs Stephenson and Randolph, of Bristol, Contractors for Transport Convicts, complained of this to Mr. Biggs, gaoler at Salisbury, in their letter to him Sept. 13, 1774. “Sore feet proved very fatal. The mortality we met with in our last ship, if repeated in this, will so forfeit us, that we shall never take another. We lost an immense sum by them; and our ship is detained to this moment under quarantine.”

back to his former mansion; and Shortens a wretched life, that might have been, that fain would have been, an useful one?

In order to redress these various evils, the first thing to be taken into consideration is the Prison itself. Many County-Gaols and other Prisons are so decayed and ruinous, or, for other reasons, so totally unfit for the purpose, that new ones must be built in their stead. Others are very incommodious, but may be improved upon the ground about them, which is occupied by the keeper, or not used at all. Some need little more than a thorough repair. In order to give what little assistance I can to those who must build a new County-Gaol, I will take the liberty to suggest what hath occurred to me upon this head, in hopes that some more skilful hand will undertake the generous and benevolent talk, of carrying to perfection a scheme of which I can only draw the outlines. I shall first say something of the

SITUATION.

---

A COUNTY-GAOL, and indeed every prison, should be built on a spot that is airy, and if possible near a river, or brook. I have commonly found prisons situated near a river, the cleaned; and most healthy. They generally

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS. 41

have not (they could not well have) subterraneous dungeons, which have been deflruCtive to thousands: and by their nearness to running water, another evil, almotl as noxious, is prevented, that is, the drench of sewers.

I said a Gaol should be near a streamj but I mud; annex! this caution; that it be not so near as that either the house or yard shall be within the reach of floods. This circumstance was so little thought of at Appleby in Westmoreland, when their new Gaol was built, that I saw the walls marked from nine inches to three feet high by floods.

If it be not practicable to build near a stream, then an eminence should be chosen: for as the walls round a prison-yard mutt be so high as greatly to obstruct a free circulation of air; this inconvenience should be lessened by a rising ground: and the prison should not be surrounded by other buildings, nor built in the middle of a town or city.

G

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.

42

PLAN.

THE annexed engraving represents such a plan for a prison as, according to my ideas, unites the greatest advantages with regard to health, order, and security. By the assistance of the references it will explain itself better than can be done by a verbal description. I shall only fub-join a few general remarks on some particulars in the structure.

THAT part of the building which is detached from the walls, and contains the men-felons ward, may be square, Arcades, or rectangular, raised oil arcades, that it may be more airy, and leave under it a dry walk in wet weather. Wards over arcades are. also bed: for safety, for I have found that escapes have been most commonly effected by undermining cells*and dungeons. If the felons should find any other means to break out of this raised ward, they will Hill be llopt by the wall of the yard.

When I went into Horsham Gaol with the keeper, we saw a heap of Hones and rubbish. The felons had been two or three days undermining the foundation of their room, and a general escape was intended that night. We were but just in time to prevent it; for it was almost night when wc went in Our lives were at their trcrcy: but (thank God) they did not attempt to murder us, and rush out.

I WISH

I wish to have- so many small rooms or cabins in this ward, that each criminal may sleep alone *. If it be difficult to prevent their being together in the day-time, they should by all means be separated at night. Solitude and ft-lence are favourable to reflection; and may possibly lead them to repentance. Privacy and hours of thoughtfulness are necessary for those who must soon leave the world; and in the Old Newgate there were ffteen cells for persons in this situation, which are Rill left Handing, with the design of annexing them to the new building. The like provision for such as return to society, cannot be less needful. One of the writers cited in the note, Bishop Butler, affirms that it is much more so, “ since it must be acknowledged, of “ greater consequence in a religious, as well as civil respect, “ how persons live than how they die.”

The separation 1 am pleading for, especially at night, would prevent escapes, or make them very difficult: for

that is the time in which they are generally planned, and effected. Another reason for separation is, that it would free gaolers from a difficulty of which I have heard them complain: they hardly know where to keep criminals ad^-

See the importance of this separation llrongly urged in a letter to Sir Robert Ladbroke, printed for Oliver, 1771. See also a Spital Sermon of Bishop Butler preached before the Magistrates of London, April 14th. 1750, particularly page 20th, Sec.

mitted. to be evidence for the King. These would be murdered by their accomplices if put among them; and in more than one prison, I have seen them, for that reason, put in the women's ward.

Where there are opposite windows they should have shutters; but these should be open all day. In the men-felons ward there should be no glass; nor should the prisoners be allowed to flop the windows with straw. See.

The women-felons should be quite separate from the men*: and young criminals from old and hardened offenders. Each of these three daffies should also have their day-room or kitchen j and their court-yard and offices all separate.

Every court should be paved for the more convenient washing it; and have a good pump, or pipes laid in j both if possible: and the Pump and Pipes should be repaired as loon as they need it; otherwise the Gaols will soon be of-fenfive and imwholesome, as I have always found them to be in such cases.

Doctor Hales, on the subject, page 12, shews that it will supply seventy-five tons of air in a minute.

The infirmary and sheds will not render the yard unsafe, provided the walls have parapets, or small chevaux de frise.

Debtors and felons should have wards totally separate: the peace, the cleanliness, the health and morals of debtors cannot be secured otherwise. The Act 22d and.23d Charles

II. Chapter 20, requires this separation at night; that debtors may not be disturbed by the curses and other profane language of felons: “ Be it enacted,-- That they shall “ be put, kept, and lodged separate and apart one from e< another, in distinct rooms.” These words do perhaps in the strict construction imply no more than nodturnal separation. But surely it is a far greater mischief for debtors to be annoyed and corrupted by the wicked conversation of felons all day long, than to be disturbed by it in the nighttime. I am not designing to infer from hence, nor yet from -the character of the Gentlemen who composed that Parliament, that the Act should be construed according to my view of the argument; or to what I conjecture was their intention. I know it is wrong to explain laws by such a vague principle as the supposed spirit of them. But it seems to me necessary that there should be a total separation. These different forts of prisoners are indeed generally separated at night. I do not recollect more than two or three Gaols

where

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.

47

where they lodge together, viz. Brecon, Portsmouth, the Borough-Compter, and Clerkenwell Bridewell. I must now add Tothill fields Bridewell, where petty debtors are confined, because Westminster Gatehouse is taken down.

Constant reparation is desirable: the Gaol will by that means be kept cleaner: and if the small-pox, or the gaol-fever, should infect one ward, the other at a difiance may be free from it. This would also remove the objection that is now made against permitting debtors to work: that is, the danger of their furnishing felons with tools for mifehies, or escape.

In the debtors ward there should be a day-room or kitchen; also a large Workshop for such as are willing to Work-sho>. work. Some few Gaols have, the latter; and in them I have seen chair-makers, shoe-makers, &c. employed in their several trades; preserving their habit of industry; contributing to the support of their families; and lightening the burthen that by their imprisonment falls on the respective parishes.

Prisoners indicted for felony should not be compelled to work. But I have heard many of them wishing the y might be permitted to earn something for their more comfortable support. In some few Gaols they have this privilege, as at Exeter, Norwich, &c.

A chapel is necessary in a Gaol. I have chosen for it what seems to me a proper situation. It should have a gallery for debtors or women , and the rest may be separated below.

REGULATIONS.

WITHOUT a due attention to the (Economy and government of a Prison, it is evident that no contrivance of structure can secure it from being the abode of wickedness, disease, and misery; I shall therefore offer a few hints for the better regulation of a Gaol.

THE first care must be to find a good man for a Gaoler; one that is honest, active, and humane. Such was Abel Dagge, who was formerly keeper of Bristol Newgate. I regretted his death, and revere his memory.

This officer must be sober himself, that he may, by example, as well as authority, restrain drunkenness, and other vices in his prison. To remove a ffrong temptation to the

Gaoler.

50

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.

contrary, it is highly requisite that no Gaoler, Turnkey, or other servant be suffered to hold the 'Tap; or to have any connexion, concern, or interest whatever in the sale of liquors of any kind. Gaolers who hold, or'let, the tap, find their account in not only conniving at, but promoting drunkenness and midnight revels. What profligate and debauched company of both sexes, do we fee let into our Gaols, that the tap may be kept running ! Besides this, the Gaoler's interest in the sale of liquors, may prompt him to be partial in his behaviour to his prisoners; to treat at least with negleds, those who are poor and have nothing to spend; which is the case of far the greater number: while he shall caress difhcneft debtors, who take ftielter in a prison, in order to live there in riot upon the property of their creditors. I

I know that by the statute of 32d George II. a Debtor has a right to send out of the Gaol for liquor and other ne-ceflaries*. This is a very judicious provision; and very beneficial to prisoners where they have the full and free use of it. But some Gaolers there are, who find ways to restrain this privilege, for the profits of their tap: whereas if Gaolers were prohibited from all concern in the sale of liquor, this would not only remove that check, and restore to prisoners the free enjoyment of the liberty they are entitled to;

“ At his free will and pleasure, to fend for, or to have brought to him--- at sea-' sonable times in the day time, any beer, ale, victuals, or any other Yicccflary food.”

but

but would also be the means of suppressing much Intemperance; and perhaps of entirely abolishing Garnish, as well as Clubs or night associations.

That it is necessary to deprive Gaolers of all profits arising from the Tlap, I am convinced, not by mere speculation, but by what I have learned from conversation with Gaolers themselves. I asked two of them, whom I found candid and intelligent, “ what they thought would be the “ most likely means of effecting a thorough reformation in c‘ Gaols.” The answer I had from both, was to this purpose, “ Let no licences be granted for felling beer or wine “ in Gaols: let it be made some other way worth our while “ to keep them.”

Gaolers should have salaries proportioned to the trust and trouble; since no office, if faithfully and humanely administered, better deserves an adequate encouragement: yet not so much as to raise them above attention to their duty, and the daily inspection of their Gaols.

The Gaol-Committee, which I have mentioned before, in their Report of the Marshalsea Prison, 14 May 1729, after enumerating many mischiefs which they found had been occasioned by the Gaoler's holding or letting the tap, draw the following conclusion; “ This ffiewS the inconveniency “ of the Keepers having the advantage of the Tap-house, “ lince to advance the rent thereof, and to consume the liquors

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.

“there vended, they not only encourage riot and “ drunkenness, but also prevent the needy prisoner from “ being supplied by his friends with the meer necessaries of “ life, in order to encrease an exorbitant gain to their “ tenants.”

When I was in Ireland (January 1775) I found, not without some surprise, that no liquors were fold in any of the prisons which I saw. Upon inquiry, I learned that there is an Act against it, made in the third year of his prefen t Majesty*.

No Prisoner should be a Turnkey. It is the Gaoler's duty to insped: the wards himself every day, and not to leave this to servants f'. The Magistrates of

The preamble runs thus, “ Whereas many frauds and abuses have been commicted by Gaolers — brewing of drink, and baking of bread, which they oblige “ their prisoners to take from them at their own rates- — Be it enacted — that no “ Gaoler or any person in trust for him, shall brew or bake in the Gaol — -or in any “ place — -for sale, or keep any lhop for the felling of bread, or beer, or ale, or “ other liquors, under the penalty of five pounds for every such offence.”

t In my first journeys many County-Gaolers excused themselves from going with me into the Felons Ward. In one County-Gaol the Felons told me once and again that the Gaoler had not been in their ward for months. I would not have quoted a report from Felons, if the Turnkey, who was present, had not confirmed their testimony.

Glasgow have expressly ordered that “ The Gaoler every “ morning and evening, at the opening of, and before the “ /hutting up the prison, shall personally visit every room “ and place therein.”

I have said before, a Gaoler should not live at a distance from his prison -f\ He should not only reside on the spot, but be confhmtly at home. Prisoners generally take advantage from his absence. For this reason, no Keeper of a Prison should be a Sheriff's Officer. Such are very often abroad; and some of them have acknowledged to me, that

I ought not here to omit my grateful acknowledgment of the politeness and civility of these Gentlemen, who, on my visit to the place in January 1775, did me the honour of presenting me with the freedom of the city, in a manner truly hospitable and obliging.

their business as Officers was incompatible with their duty as Gaolers.

I HAD the pleasure to find a Chaplain appointed to most of the County-Gaols; in consequence of the Act made 13th of his present Majesty. When this office is vacant, it behoves Magistrates not to take the firlf Clergyman who offers his service, without regarding his real character. They should choose one who is in principle a Christian: who will not content himself with officiating in public; but will converse with the prisoners; admonish the profligate; exhort the thoughtless; comfort the sick; and make known to the condemned that 'Mercy which is revealed in the Gospel.

In the Life of Bernard Gilpin, page 173, the writer, speaking of his labours, informs us, that “ where-ever he came, he used to visit all the Jails and places of confinement; few in the kingdom having at that time*any appointed Minister.” And by his affectionate address “ he

In the next reign he was promoted to the rich living of Houghton in Northumberland: and it was there he laboured, as is said above.

In some prisons where there is a Chaplain appointed, no worship is fixed for Sunday: in some where that day is fixed, the Chaplain, choosing his hours, comes sometimes too soon in the morning, sometimes between morning and evening service, at the prisoners dinner-time: in some there is no fixed day at all. It would be proper to have sermon and prayers once at least on the Lord's Day: and prayers two fixed days in the week besides. And if a Chapter of the Neiv "TeJIament were read daily in order by one of the prisoners to the rest, or by the Gaoler before the distribution of prison allowance, the time would not be mispent. The reader, if a prisoner, might be allowed a small weekly pension. The Gaoler should not, as some do, hinder any prisoner from attending divine service. He ought to remove every hindrance: and, on Sunday especially, no vi-fitants should be admitted during that time. Visitants who are there before, should go out or attend.

Upon asking at more places than one, “ why there were so few prisoners at prayers,” I have been answered, " they are drinking with their friends.” The Gaoler should be constant at Chapel with his prisoners; and set a good example

for them to follow. The Chaplain who officiates in the Gaol may also be employed at the Bridewell, where the distance will allow; and preach once a Sunday in each prison.

It perhaps will be said, that I propose a great deal of duty to these gentlemen. The Act just recited allows a sum not exceeding jifty pounds a year for their services. Many counties have fixed that salary; but I should hope that Clergymen might be found who would acct from a much nobler motive, a regard to the most important interests of their fellow-creatures.

THE late Act for preserving the health of prisoners requires that an experienced Surgeon or Apothecary be appointed to every Gaol: a man of repute in his profession. His bu-finefs is, in the first place, to order the immediate removal of the sick to the Infirmary. Their irons should be taken off; and they should have, not only medicines, but also diet suitable to their condition. He muff: diligently and daily visit them himself; not leaving them to journeymen and apprentices. He should constantly inculcate the necessity of cleanliness and fresh air; and the danger of crowding prisoners together. I need not add, that he must report to the Justices at each Quarter Sessions, a state of the health of the prisoners under his care.

At Newgate there are commonly about two hundred prisoners.

foners. Here the danger to them, and to the city from them, is great. To this capital pril'on in the metropolis, the Magistrates would, in my humble opinion, do well to appoint a Physician, a Surgeon, and Apothecary. One of the two latter to visit each ward in the prison every day. The two Compters are near enough'to be taken care of by tire fame gentlemen; and they need to be visited as con-flantly. This attention would, in all probability, prevent the spread of any infectious disease in those Gaols; and flop the mouths of County-Gaolers, who, when their prisons are infected, tell you (as I have often heard them) “ The “ distemper was brought from Newgate by prisoners removed from thence by habeas corpus.”

NO Prisoner should be subject to any demand of Fees. The Gaoler should have a salary in lieu of them; and so should the Turnkeys. Their wages should not be included in the Gaoler's salary: and not only their pay, but the number of them necessary for each prison, should be determined by the Magistrates. Neither of those articles should be left to the interested appointment of a Gaoler. If fees be not abolifired, J am sure they should be reduced; and so should the Chamber Rents for Master-side Debtors. In this matter (of the Chambers) another regulation is also needful; that is, no middle-sized room should have more beds than two. The bedding and other furniture should be specified as to articles and value.

For Common-side Debtors there should be a ward entirely free: they should not be subject to any demand of rent; as in many prisons they are. These prisoners should either be alimented by their creditors without expence and delay; or have from the county the fame allowance of every kind (at least) as felons: food, bedding, and medicine.

IN order to cleanliness, than which scarce any thing in the whole oeconomy of a Gaol is of more importance, every ward and room should be well scraped; and then washed with lime and water during the act of effervescence*, at least twice a year; just after the Lent and Summer Assize: Each ward and room should be swept, and washed,' every day, by the respective inhabitant; and some times with hot vinegar. Idle Gaolers affect to excuse their negligence in this respect, by pretending that, daily washing would make the rooms too damp, and endanger the health of prisoners. This is mere pretence: the effect is directly contrary. There is not in England a prison more healthy, considering the number of prisoners of the lowest fort, than ‘T'otbil/fields Bridewell , where the rooms are washed every day. The prisoners do the work by turns: and the healthiness of the prison is a demonstration, that no inconvenience, but great benefit, is the consequence. In Newgate, the prisoner who fwccps the ward has a double allowance of bread. Every

prisoner should be obliged to wash his hands and face before he comes for his daily allowance 3 and to keep himself as neat as circumstances will admit *. I have said before, there should be plenty of water in a prison 3 and need not add now, that prisoners Should constantly have free and easy access to it.

Every prisoner who comes to Gaol dirty, should be washed in the cold or warm bath3 and his cloaths should be put into the oven, in a lack, on a pair of iron dogs. He should be provided with coarse washing cloaths to wear while his own are thus purifying: washing cloaths should be kept ready in the Gaol for this purpose. Each prisoner should have a clean shirt once a week. There should be in each ward a towel on a roller clean every day. Pails, mops.

Sir John Pringle, in his last Anniversary Discourse at the Royal Society, on the subject of Captain Cook's successful care of the ship's crew in his Voyage round the World; and the medal deservedly adjudged to him on that account, has the following passage at page 26. “ It is well known how much Cleanliness conduces “ to health; but it is not so obvious how much it also tends to good order and other “ virtues. That diligent officer was persuaded — that such men as he could induce “ to be more cleanly than they were disposed to be of themselves, became at the “ fame time more sober, more orderly, and more attentive to their duty.” This remark is confirmed by an observation in the Spectator, No. 631, “ Several

“ vices, destructive both to mind and body, are inconsistent with the habit of Cleanliness.”

brooms, soap, vinegar, and fuel for the oven, should be supplied by the county or town: otherwise Gaols will never be kept clean and wholesome.

No liable or dunghill should be suffered in the yard*nor any fowls kept there, which I have often seen not only in the yards, but also in the rooms of many prisons. Sweepings, ashes, &c. should be taken away every week.

IF the bedding is ft raw, it should be put in coarse can-vafs; if it is not so enclosed, it ought to be changed every week. Each bed should have a coarse coverlid or two.

Prisoners should riot remain in the day-time in the little rooms or cabins in which they ileep: they should have a common ward, day-room or kitchen.

The Act of Parliament in Ireland, which I mentioned in a former note, orders that “ No Gaoler or any person employed by him, shall presume on any account to keep in the said Gaols, or the yard, or the houses adjoining thereto, and “ provided for the use of such prisoners, any hogs, cows, or other cattle, under the “ penalty of forty shillings for such hog, cow, or other bead kept in the said Gaol or Prison.”

liquor, ought to have at least a pound and half of bread every day. The bread should be one day old, and then honestly weighed to them. If once a week (suppose on Sunday) some of the coarser pieces of beef were boiled in the copper, and half a pound of the meat without bone given to each prisoner, with a quart of the broth, and then only one pound of bread, this Sunday Dinner might be made an encouragement to peaceable and orderly behaviour: the turbulent and refractory should not have it. Such an allowance, might help to remove a bad custom that obtains too generally, the pretence of refreshing prisoners with better food and drink on Sunday; upon which many are admitted into the Gaols, and keep the prisoners from Chapel.

I state the allowance in weight, not money, because of the variable price. Besides that quantity of bread, each prisoner should have a penny a day in money for cheele, butter, potatoes, pease, or turnips; or he should have a pennyworth of one of those articles.

Here, as in the tap, I mull infill upon it as highly ne-cefl'ary, that every Gaoler, Bridewell-Keeper, Turnkey, &cc. be excluded from all concern in the prisoners allowance; from all profit arising directly or indirectly from the sale of their bread, or other food. Whoever distributes it, should be free from all temptation to fraud; and be subject to a

strong check *. The whole allowance of prisoners lliould never be given them in money.

The Reader will plainly fee, that I am not an advocate for extravagant and profuse allowance to prisoners. I plead only for necessaries, in such a moderate quantity, as may support health and strength for labour. The law allows the poor debtor who is detained in prison, two shillings and four-pence per week*j- (I wish it were more easily obtained) and the government allowance to assize convicts under sentence of transportation is a little more, viz. two shillings and six-pence; which the Sheriff charges to Government in his bill of cravings, presented at the expiration of his office. And I believe upon the average price of bread, potatoes, &c. the allowance I have mentioned does not exceed those sums. I presume it may be thought rather incongruous to allow prisoners before trial (on which some of them may be found not guilty) less than is given to those that are convicted.

NO fighting (liould be suffered in a Gaol: no quarreling, or abusive language; nor the frequent occasion of them.

In- Ireland the Minister of the Parish where the Gaol is, orders the felons bread; and keeps (should keep) the account of it: for he is allowed by Act of Parliament a sum not exceeding ten pounds a year for the trouble.

The mention of legacies reminds me of the need there is of a list of them painted legibly on a board j which should be hung up so as to be read by the prisoners- Very few Gaols have such a table: and for want of it many Legacies have been entirely loft; and the charitable intention of the Testators frustrated.

In the like conspicuous manner should be hung up in every Gaol an authentic table of fees, till they are abo-liflied. This also is expressly required by the fame Act. Yet in many Gaols it is totally disregarded, and they have no such tables.

Inspector, FINALLY, The care of a Prison is too important to be left wholly to a Gaoler; paid indeed for his attendance, but often tempted by his passions, or interest, to fail in his duty. To every prison there should be an Inspector appointed; either by his colleagues in the magistracy, or by Parliament *. Sheriffs and Magistrates have indeed this power already; and prisons are their immediate care. But some Sheriffs excuse themselves from attention to this part of their duty, on account of the short duration, expence, and trouble of their office: and those Gentlemen, as well as Gentlemen in the Commission of the Peace, have no doubt been fearful of the consequence of looking into prisons. But the danger from such inspection is in great mea-

sure removed: and it may be expected that Sheriffs will now engage in this business; and that among Justices, and Town-Magistrates, there may always be found one man generous enough to undertake this important service. Or if the conffant trouble be thought too much for one person, it may proceed by annual, quarterly, or monthly rotation.

The Inspector should make his visit once in a week, or at most in a fortnight , changing his days. He should take with him a memorandum of all the rules, and inquire into the observance or neglect of them. He should (as is done in some of our Hospitals) look into every room, to fee if it be clean, &c. He should speak with every prisoner; hear all complaints; and immediately correct what he finds manifestly wrong: what he doubts of, lie may refer to his brethren in office, at their next meeting. A good Gaoler will be pleased with this scrutiny: it will do him honour, and confirm him in his Ration. In case of a less worthy Gaoler, the examination is more needful, in order to his being reprimanded; and, if he be incorrigible, to his being discharged. This Honourable Delegate should have nofa-lary: he should engage from the noble motive of doing justice to prisoners, and service to his country. I

It is a Ihocking thing to destroy in prison the morals, the health, and (as is often done) the lives of those whom, the law consigns only to hard labour and correction. One is charged with bastardy: another is abusive in a drunken quarrel: a young creature, who perhaps was never taught a moral lesion, is guilty of some petty theft: fend them to Bridewell for a year, or two, which they mull consume in idleness, hunger, dirt, with companions much improved by such education — If that prison be not secure, fend them into Mil worse company, that of abandoned felons in the County-Gaol — What is this but devoting them to de~ strudtion

For women, especially those that have children with them, and sometimes at the bread, there should be a chimney in one or two rooms: and in winter firing should be allowed. I have known infants starved to death for want of this. In some prisons the fnioke has no vent but at the doors and windows. In some Bridewells there should be a separate little room or two for faulty apprentices, as at Tothillfields, and Clerkenwell. In all, two airy wards for the sick, with medical relief. Men and women should have work-shops, as well as night-rooms, separate-f-. There should be baths, and an oven, for the fame purposes as in the Gaols.

It was remarked that a Gaoler should not be an old or infirm person; the fame caution is requisite with regard to the Keeper of a Bridewell; since such an one would neither be able to keep the prisoners properly at work, nor to prevent their making their escape at the time of locking up, as I knew to happen at Preston in Lancashire, and other places.

in Tothillfields and Clerkenwell many more. Great care should be taken to prevent infection; to keep the House clean, and well aired; and invariably to adhere to ftrict rules of sobriety and diligence, in order to correct the faults of prisoners, and make them for the future useful to society. Gentle discipline is commonly more efficacious than feve-rity; which should not be exercised but on such as will not be amended by lenity. These should be punished by solitary confinement on bread and water, for a time proportioned to their fault. The Keeper should, by all means, reside in the House. He should not be fuftered to farm any part of the allowance; nor to fell liquor, or any thing else. The whole management should be frequently inquired into, in the same manner as that of a Gaol, and by the fame Inspectors. I

I know not any reason why a House of Correction may not be conducted with as much regularity, as any other house where the family is equally numerous. Some foreign Bridewells are so conducted. Let the sober and diligent be distinguished by some preference in their diet, or lodging; or by shortening the term of their confinement; and giving them, when discharged, a good character. This last will be a strong incitement to good behaviour. The common diet should be at least as good and as much as that of felons in a Gaol. The hours of rising, of reading a chapter in

73

the bible, or prayers, of meals, of work. See. should all be fixed by the magistrates, and notice of them given by a bell.

A Bridewell under proper regulation would contribute not a little towards its own maintenance. An exact account should be kept of the profit of the work; and all of it applied to common benefit; not left to the disposal of Keepers: for some of them in the few Bridewells where work is done, keep to themselves a sixth part, some half and some the whole of the prisoners earnings; giving them only the short county-allowance, and sometimes but part of that. When I Paid all the earnings should go to common Rock, I meant it of the Rated hours for working. Those who will employ themselves in extra-hours, should have the profit to themselves. And perhaps it might be an encouragement to diligence in the Rated hours, to give them some small portion of the profit of these also. With regular oeconomy, Prisoners would be better nourished, and fitter for labour, than they now are and yet the county not burthened with much, if any, additional expence. But a building fit for the intention ought first to be provided.

The charge of this, as well as of a proper Gaol, will no doubt, be complained of But if that be weighed againR the benefit that will accrue to the public, it will be found but light. Besides that ought not to be allowed as a valid

objection, the occasion of which Should have been removed long ago. Why have fomc Prisons been Suffered to become ruinous; so that many rooms in them are unsafe, and prisoners are crowded together in the few that remain ? Why were not the walls of the yards repaired in time, that prisoners might with safety be allowed the proper use of them ? Money, to the amount of thousands is not witheld when Shire-halls and Town-halls are wanted. These we often fee grand and elegant Edifices. Why should it be Spared when the morals and lives of multitudes are at flake; and when it is impossible the designofthe Legislature should be answered without it ? I mean amending the manners of Petty Offenders; preventing the increase of felonies, and the Spread of diseases. That the two latter, instead of being prevented, are promoted by the present irregularity of Bridewells, is notorious*. Prescription founded on culpable negligence Should not be admitted in bar of a demand, which every principle of equity, humanity, and utility conspires to enforce.

I have only farther to add under this head, that the

management of Bridewells is now a matter of more than ordinary concern, since offenders are at present committed to them for terms so long as from three to ten years. Most of these persons would probably have been fen fenced to transportation when that mode of punishment was in use.

I had taken some pains to make inquiries concerning the state of transports, with regard to whom many cruelties and impositions were commonly practised, and whole condition was in many respects equally contrary to humanity and good policy: I flattered myself that I had discovered means of remedying these evils in a considerable degree, and of dif-burthening the counties of a heavy expence with which they were charged; and was preparing to lay them before the Public, when a new turn was given to the matter by Act of Parliament*.

It may be said, that from the many conveniences suggested in the structure of Gaols, and the removal of those hardships which rendered them so terrible, the dread of being confined in them will in great measure be taken off, and the lower clades of people will find them more comfortable places of residence than their own houses. But let it be considered, in the first place, that although I have indeed recommended such attentions in the construction and management as may free them from the diseases and hardships under which they have laboured, I have proposed nothing to give them an air of elegance, or pleasant-nefs. On the contrary, I have censured the plan of some modern Gaols as too fliewy and splendid; and nothing abroad struck me more with regard to these buildings, -than the perfect plainness and fimplicily of their appearance. Then, with respect to the more humane treatment of the prisoners

AN ACCOUNT OF FOREIGN

PRISONS.

I DESIGNED to publish the Account of our Prisons in the Spring 1775, after I returned from Scotland, and Ireland. But conjecturing that something useful to my purpose, might be collected abroad, I laid aside my papers, and travelled into France, Flanders, Holland, and Germany. I flattered myself that my labour was not quite fruitless: and repeated my viflt to these countries, and also to Switzerland, last summer. I

I shall not give an account of every foreign prison I saw, whether it had any thing peculiar or not: this would be tedious and uninflruCtive. Nor do I mention the frauds which I observed, or from the evasive answers of Keepers, had reason to suspect. The redress and investigation of foreign abuses was not my object.

In my relation I shall follow the order of my last journey, and begin with

FRANCE.

IN or near Paris are the Conciergerie, Grand and Petit Chatelet, Fort I'Eveque, the Bicetre; and some others.

Mv first question at each prison commonly was, “ Whether the Gaoler or Keeper resided in the House ? " and the answer was always in the affirmative.

Most Prisons in the city have three or four gates; from to 4'- feet high; separated. from each other by a little area or court. Within the inner gate is, in some prisons, a Turnstile. The number and lowness of the gates (at each of which you mud: stoop) and the turnstiles, effectually prevent the prisoners ruffling out.

In moss of the prisons there are five or six ‘Turnkeys; viz. two or three at the gates: one walking in the yard, to prevent conferring and plotting (a circumstance to which French Gaolers are very attentive): one at the womens ward: and every day one of them is abroad, or otherwise

at

Paris.

at leilure. This liberty they have in rotation. They are strictly prohibited, under severe penalties, from receiving any thing of the prisoners, directly or indirectly, on any pretence whatever. The Gaoler is obliged to board them; and to pay each of them at lead one hundred livres a year. It must be paid quarterly, in presence of the Deputy of the Attorney-General.

a/

I was furorized at seeing that none of the prisoners were in Irons. No Gaoler (I was informed) may put them on a prisoner, without an express order from the Judge. And yet in some of the Prisons, there were more criminals than in any of our London Gaols. When I was first there, the number had been recently increased by an insurrection on account of the scarcity of corn.- My Reader will perhaps presently fee reason to conclude, that the manner in which Prisons are conducted makes the confinement more tolerable, and chains leis needful. Indeed it was evident, from the very appearance of the prisoners in most of the Gaols, that humane attention was paid to them.

Most of the courts are paved; and they are walked three or four times a day. One would hardly believe how this freshens the air in the upper rooms. I felt this very sensibly once and again when I was in the chambers: and an English-man, who had the misfortune to be a prisoner, made the fame remark. But I seldom or ever found in any French Prison that

Sect. IV.

FRANCE.

81

offensive smell which I had often perceived in English Gaols. I sometimes thought these courts were the cleaned places in Paris. One circumdance that contributes to it, betides the number of Turnkeys, is, that most of them are near the river.

Prisoners, especially criminals, attend Mass every day, and the Gaoler or a Turnkey with them: but such of them as are Protedants are excused. No person is admitted into any Prison during the time of Divine Service.

As condemned criminal's generally throw off all reserve, and by relating their various adventures and success prove pernicious tutors to young and less practised offenders; care is taken to prevent this mischief, by fending those who are sentenced to the Gallies, to a separate Prison at the Port de St. Bernard: where they are kept till there is a proper number of them to be carried off. Some continue there many months; but their term commences two days after sentence. I heard that about two hundred were sent from that Prison to Marseilles and 1Toulon, a week or two before I was there.

To prevent the frequent consequences of desperation, no one condemned to death by the inferior court, is without hopes of life, till the Parliament, to which he commonly appeals, confirms or reverses the sentence: and they never

M make

82

make known their decilion, till the morning of the day on which a prisoner is to suffer. Then they publish a confirmation of the former sentence j and it is fold in the streets.

The chambers are opened at seven in the morning from November ill: to Easter j at fix from Easter to November: and shut in the evening at fix from November i ft to Easter; at seven from Easter to November. But debtors have an hour more at night. This they commonly spend in the court; as they do not choose to be there in the day-time, among felons. Common-side prisoners are obliged to come out of their night-rooms at the fore-mentioned morning-hours. Experience having shewn, that idleness and lying in bed, are productive of the Scurvy and other dillempers. Women are kept quite separate from men. Where there is but one court-yard, as in the Conciergerie, they have the use of it from twelve till two and the men are flint up. I happened to be in that prison at those hours. The court is fifty-five yards by thirty-eight; and has a fine piazza on three fides; on one side the piazza is double. This was the largest prison in the city before the fire in January 1776: but the Grand Chatelet is now larger, and has more prisoners; viz. 371. In this prison (the Conciergerie) and the Petit Chatelet, I observed the Infirmaries were the upper-most rooms: the belt situation, as one of the Gaolers ob-ierved, “ both for air, and to prevent the spreading of any

infectious

infectious distemper.” Men and women had separate Tick wards.

Taking Qarnish, or Footing, is strictly prohibited. If prisoners demand of a new comer any thing of that fort, on whatever pretence; if in order to obtain it they distress him by hiding his cloaths, &c. they are (hut up for a fortnight in a dark dungeon, and suffer other punishment. They are obnoxious to the fame chastisement for hiding one another's cloaths, or being otherwise injurious.

The daily allowance to criminals is a pound and half of good bread, and some soup. The soup is not made, nor is any other provision drefied, in the prisons. They have clean - linen once a week, from a Society, which was initituted about the year 1753. The occasion of it was the prevalence of a contagious disease which in France they call Le Scorbut, the Scurvy. This distemper was found to proceed from the prisons; and to spread in the Hotel Dieu, whither prisoners that had it were removed. The cause of it was generally thought to be Want of Cleanliness in Prisons where several of those confined had worn their linen for many months, and infected the most healthy new-comers that were put in the room with them. Eight hundred were ill of it at once in the Hospital of St. Louis, to which all that were sick of it in the Hotel Dieu had been carried. By the Abbe Breton's exerting himself on this occasion, a

M 2 fund

84

fund was raised to support Prisoners in the Grand Chatelet with clean linen every week. This put an effectual flop to the malady in that Prison. Numbers afterwards joined the Society: the king and queen honoured it with their contributions: and the charity extended to three other Prisons; so that at last seven hundred prisoners were provided for in the same manner, and a flock of linen requisite for that purpose, viz. five thousand shirts, was completed. The elder prisoners have charge of the linen that is in the Prison j they receive and return it, and are gratified by the Society; which continues to the present time *. Bclides this, there is scarce a Prison in the city that has not a Pa-tronefs -f-; a Lady of character, who voluntarily takes care that those in the infirmaries be properly attended; gives them firing; l'upplies them and the felons in dungeons with linen; docs many kind offices to the prisoners in general; and by soliciting the charity of others, procures not only the relief and comforts mentioned already, but soup twice a week, and meat once a fortnight.

There is also annually at each Prison somewhat like our Charity Sermons; i. e. Public Service in the Chapel, and a Collection.

Those who sleep on straw, pay the Gaoler no fee at entrance, ordischarge; but they pay-one fou or halfpenny a day; and have clean fhraw once a month: those in the dungeons, once a fortnight. These are seldom let out; never in the yard.

The Chamber-Rents are all regulated. Those who sleep on beds pay ten fous entrance, and the fame when discharged. If they lie alone, they pay five fous a day, if two in a bed, three fous each. The Gaoler finds them clean sheets in summer once in three weeks; in winter once a month. Those who board with him, and have a bed, not a room to themselves, pay a sum not exceeding three livres a day (2s. yd.i): but nothing at entrance or discharge. Such boarders as have a chamber to themselves and firing, pay twenty fous a week more: if no fire-place fifteen fous. Both these forts have clean sheets in summer once a fortnight; in winter, in three weeks. The Gaoler's servants attend them. There are also half-boarders; and some who have an entire chamber, but no board*.

The discipline observed is so exact, that at the late fire in the Conciergerie, the numerous prisoners (as I was informed) were removed without any confusion, or a single escape. There are good rules for preserving peace; for suppressing profaneness; for prohibiting Gaolers or Turnkeys abusing prisoners by beating them or otherwise *; forbidding their furnishing them with wine or spirituous

liquors, so as to cauie excess, drunkenness, &c. Keepers are punished for this when known to the Magistrates, by a fine for the first offence; and for the second by stripes.

They are allowed to fell some things to their prisoners: but the quality, quantity and price mufl be such as the ordinances of police define and require.

Gaolers and Turnkeys are obliged to visit once a day at lead;, all the dungeons. I was sorry to find the humanity which is so conspicuous in the 'forementioned, and other excellent rules, so deficient as to continue the use of those subterraneous abodes; which are totally dark, and beyond imagination horrid and dreadful. Poor creatures are confined in them night and day for weeks, for months together. They visit these, I say, daily: and if they find any prisoners sick, they mufl acquaint the Physician and Surgeon; who visit them; and if needful, order them to more wholesome rooms till they recover.

Keepers are not tempted by paying for their places, to oppress their prisoners: to remove all pretext for so doings rents which they formerly paid to the Crown are remitted; and the leases given up.

As for debtors, their number is small. Of the 202 Prisoners in the Cotictergerie, but fix were Debtors. In

some

88

FOREIGN PRISONS.

some other Prisons there were a few more. - This perhaps is owing to the following good laws. Every Bailiff who arrests and imprisons a Debtor, must pay to the Gaoler in advance a month's aliment or subsistence, i. e. ten livres ten fous, equal to nine shillings English (provisions' being at Paris cheaper in general than at London): and if the like sum be not paid within fourteen days after the end of every month, the prisoner is set at liberty. Besides this, the Debtor pays no costs of arrests, &c. The whole of them falls on the Creditor: and so do all expences occasionea by his sickness, or death.

As the bell Regulations are liable to be abused, prisoners are not thought sufficiently provided for by enaBing good Laws: the execution of them is carefully attended to The Substitutes of the Attorney-General visit the Prisons once a week, to inquire if the rules be observed; to hear complaints of prisoners; to fee if the sick be properly attended j and the like. — Besides this, the Parliament of Paris fends to all the Prisons five times a year two or three Counsellors with a Substitute of the Attorney-General, and two Clerks. They go at C hr if mas, Eafer, Whitsuntide, one day before i fh August, Si??ion and Jude. There is in each Prison (as in other Foreign Gaols) a room for their reception called the Council-Chamber, It is occupied at other times by the Head-Gaoler.

The arrival of this deputation is announced by boys, who, though offenders, are allowed to do little errands in the Prison: these go round the yard and into every room, giving notice of it aloud. The Deputies go, without the Gaoler or Turnkeys, into every room and dungeon, and

1. They ask the prisoners one by one, if they have any complaint to make of the Gaoler or his servants. But they never meddle with those who are confined by an order from the king.

2. They receive the petitions of criminals who have been detained too long without trial.

3. In case of debts not exceeding two thousand livres (about ninety pounds) if the debtor can raise a third part of his debt, and no more, they receive it for the creditors. How they clear him of the remaining two thirds, I will shew presently. They take notes of these matters in the Prison: and give an account of all to the Parliament, at their general public meeting a day or two after.

In behalf of criminals who have not been tried, the Parliament commonly orders the Attorney-General to write in their name to the inferior Judges, inquiring into the causes of delay, or ordering expedition. If a prisoner be acquitted, lie is discharged within twenty-four hours.

N

The

90

FOREIGN PRISONS.

The Laws of France do not in ordinary cases admit a Debtor to bail without the consent of his Creditor. But in the case mentioned above, the Parliament obliges creditors to accept of bail for the remainder of debts under two thousand livres. And even this bail leems a matter of mere form; for they sometimes take for bail men that are insolvent. I believe there is no Banding law for this j and that it is rather an immemorial custom: because the Parliament enacts a particular law for each case as it occurs. In France there are no insolvent Acts.

The Deputies hear no complaints of the Gaoler against his prisoners. When he has any to make, he applies to' the Chief Jitftice, by whose order the prisoner was committed. If he was imprisoned by an order from the king, he applies to the Lieutenant-General of the Police; if without such an order, to the Lieutenant-Criminal, See.

Besides the Deputation now mentioned, the Parliament appoints to each Prison one of their own body, a Counfeller. They always choofea Gentleman of fortune and good cha-radter: lie is called Commissaire de la Prison. His business is much like that of the Deputation; and his office perpetual. By frequent discourse with prisoners I learned, that these officers are very humane to the dillrelTed. They can (as the Parliament) oblige creditors to accept one third part ' of

of debts under two thousand livres: but they use this power with much caution.

THE Bicetre is upon a small eminence about two miles from Pan's , if it were only a prison, I should call it an enormous one. But this- for men, like the Hopitalgeneral for women, is indeed a kind of general Hospital. Of about four thousand men that are within its walls, not one half are prisoners. The majority are; The Poor, who wear a coarse brown uniform, and seem as miserable as the poor in some of our country work-houses: the Insane: and men that have the venereal disease. Each fort is in a court and apartments totally separate from the other, and from Criminals. These are confined, some in little rooms about eight feet square, window 31 by 2, with a grate, but not many glazed. By counting the windows, on one side of the House, I reckoned there must be five hundred of those rooms: there is but one prisoner in each. These pay two hundred livres a year for their board. There are others in two large rooms called La Force, on the other side of the court-yard La Conr Royale, which are crowded with prisoners. Over these two rooms is a general Inf rmary: and over that, an Infirmary for the Scurvy; a distemper very common and fatal among them.

In the middle of La Cour Royale are eight dreadful dungeons down sixteen steps: each about thirteen feet by nine:

with two drong doors; three chains fadened to the wall; and a done funnel at one corner of each cell, for air. From the situation of these dreary caverns, and the difficulty I found in procuring admittance, I conclude hardly any ether dranger ever saw them: that is my reason, and I hope will be an apology, for mentioning the particulars.

Prisoners make draw-boxes, tooth-picks, 6cc. and fell them to visitants. I viewed the men with some attention; and observed in the looks of many a settled melancholy: many others looked very sickly. This Prison seems not so well managed as those in the city: it is very dirty: no fireplace in any of the rooms: and in the severe cold lad winter, several hundreds periffied.

Water in plenty was thought of such importance here, that they have a done well which is a curiosity. It was built in 1735 s is fifteen feet diameter, and near seventy yards deep..The two Buckets hold each about three hogffieads: they are drawn, up by horses, and empty themselves into a Reservoir, sixty-four feet square, and nine deep. A bucket is drawn up in five minutes. They work sixteen hours every day, not excepting Sundays; and draw daily about five hundred hogffieads. Three horses work at a time, and twelve are kept for the service.

THE Rastile may occur to some of my readers, as an object concerning which some information would be acceptable. All that I can give them is, that I knocked hard at the outer gate, and immediately went forward through the guard to the draw-bridge before the entrance of the

Cattle. I was some time viewing this, building, which is round, and surrounded by a large moat. None of the windows look outwards, but only towards a small area; and if the ltate prisoners are ever permitted to take the fresh air, it mutt be on the leads, which have high parapets. But whiltl I was contemplating this gloomy mansion, an officer came out of the Cattle much surprized; and I was forced to retreat through the mute guard, and thus regained that freedom, which for one- locked up within those walls it is next to impossible to obtain.

MANY of my readers, acquainted with the ttridt police of France, would have supposed that the other Prisons would have been as inaccetiible to a visitant as the Bajlile. And indeed my firtt application for admittance at the Grand Chatelet was unluccelsful. But fortunately remarking the

tenth Article* of the Arret 1717, I pleaded it before the Commijj'aire de la Prifoti to whom I was referred, and by its means gained admission as well into that Prison, as those of Petit Chatelet and Fort I'Eveque, and had an opportunity of seeing alnioft every individual confined in them.

IN the provincial gaols I saw little worth noting to imitate or avoid, but what has been already mentioned at Paris. These also have charitable PatroneiTes, or Patrons, who take care that the prisoners be not defrauded of their allowance; and procure them farther relief. But these Prisons do not seem to be so carefully inspected as those in the city; although the Acts of Parliament for regulation of both are for the most part similar; and were made in the same year, ijij'f. They are drawn up with found judgment, and accurate knowledge of the complex subject. I found many articles of them in the laws of other nations;

but

The Article is as follows.

but cannot say whether the French Acts were compiled from them, or followed by them.

The ^2d Article of the Act for the Provinces requires that Prisons be “ au raiz de chauJJ'ee”*; level with the ground. Yet at Chalons, and some other towns, I saw many prisoners in dungeons; larger indeed, but in other respects not much better than those at Paris. In the four horrid ones at the Prison de St. Joseph (formerly a Convent) at Lyons, June 1776, were twenty-nine criminals: the heat so excefixve, that few of them had any other garment on than merely their shirts. Some of them were sick: none of them looked healthy. In the nine other rooms of that Gaol there were one hundred and twenty-eight prisoners of which number' twenty-two were women. To the Pierrecize, a date prison. at Lyons, you afeend by more than two hundred steps: among the few prisoners in it, I fat talking a while with one who said he was in the fiftieth year of his confinement.

I dwell perhaps too long on France. Yet I cannot leave it, without Hopping a minute longer at Lyons; to give a short account of an Hospital there.

THE Hotel Dieu is by the river's side (the Rhone). The principal building is in the form of a cross: near three hundred feet from end to end both ways. The wards thirty-two feet wide, and twenty-five feet high: with apertures between the joifls of the floor above; and two tier of windows: in many of them two casements. Three rows of iron bedsteads in each ward. Under a dome in the centre is an odtagon altar, in view from every part of the cross. Prayers, which are read there twice a day, can be heard through the wards. This part of the House is for those that have Fevers. There are other wards for Lying-in Women; for the Wounded; for Foundlings; for the Insane: all separate; and a room for chirurgical operations. The cross-wards are so airy, as not to be in the lead; -often five: and yet there are, in another part of the House, two large upper rooms Hill more airy and pleasant, Chambres de Convalescence: to these they remove patients that are recovering: and those whom I saw there said they were very refreshing. They come down from them at meals to a Refedtory or Hall. These rooms soon complete the patients recovery; and seem an excellent precaution againH the flow hedtic fever, of which our Hospital-Physicians so frequently complain; and it is

chiefly on account of these that I mention the House The whole was clean and quiet. There are eight Chaplains; nine Physicians and Surgeons; and twelve Sifters. These are ladies of a religious order, dressed in a neat uniform, who make up, as well as administer all the medicines prescribed; for which purpose there is an Elaboratory and Apothecary's Ihop, consisting of five or six apartments, the neatest and most elegantly fitted up that can be conceived.

wine. They looked healthy. Here, as in the Swiss-Cantons, meii and women are kept separate. For the last year or two no capital punishment. If a criminal flies from justice, they call him in form three days, and after trial, execute him in effigy.

No Debtors: and there fclaom are any. A creditor muff allow his debtor in prison as much as felons have from the public: upon failure, the gaoler gives notice, and then discharges the prisoner. Besides, there are sumptuary laws in this state. And though the government is in general mild, there is a severe law against bankrupts, and insolvents s which renders incapable of all honours, and deprives of freedom, not only the debtor himself, but his children after him: except such of them as pay their quota of the debts*.

IN those of the CANTONS to which I went, Felonr have each a room to themselves, “ that they may not,” said the Keepers, “ tutor one another.” None were in irons: they are kept in rooms more or less strong and lightsome, according to the crimes they arc charged with. But the Prisons are in general very strong. The rooms are num-

bered, and the keys marked with the fame numbers. In most of them a German Stove. The common allowance six-pence a day. In some Cantons there were no prisoners of this fort. The principal reason of it is, the great care that is taken to give children, even the poorest, a moral and religious education.. Another thing which contributes to the fame intention, is the laudable police of speedy justice. A criminal has notice of his death, not the manner of it, but a short time before he is to suffer: and he is then indulged with his choice of food, wine, &c. Women are not hanged, but beheaded. Every new executioner has a new sword; and in the Arsenal at Bern I saw several old ones hung up in order. In the Houses of Correction many of the prisoners were women , whom I saw at work.

The most numerous prisoners are the Galley-Slaves; improperly so calied, for there are no Galleys belonging to Switzerland.

AT Lausanne I visited a Prison, in which there were at that time no prisoners. There were dungeons, but on entering each of them the Keeper observed that we were not yet upon the ground, but there were cellars underneath. On converling with Dr. T'ijj'ot, he expressed his surprize at our Gaol-Distemper; said “ I should not find it in Switzerland: ” and added that et he had not heard of it's being any where but in

IN Bern, the principal Canton, there was in one Prison (the Schallenhaus) one hundred and twenty-four Galley-Slaves. They have not each a room to themselves; but there is Tome distinction of the more and less criminal, both in their rooms and work. Mod: of them are employed in cleaning the streets, and public walks; removing the rubbish of building i and the fnowandicein winter. The city is one of the cleaned; I have seen. Four or five are chained to a small waggon and draw; others, more at liberty, sweep, load, &c. These are known by an Iron Coliar, with a hook projecting above their heads: weight about five pounds: I saw one riveted on a criminal in about two minutes. They work in summer from seven to eleven, and from one to llx j in winter from eight to eleven, and from one to four. I

asked them, “ Whether they would choose to work so, or be confined within doors ? ” “ Much rather they said,

“ work thus." The less criminal are in separate wards. They work within doors, spinning, See. in a large room; and have not the iron collar. The Prison is not commodious, nor kept clean. The daily allowance two pounds of bread, and twice a day a pint and half of soup, made of barley, beans, &c. they fetch it from the City-Hospital. In their leilure-hours they make trifles to fell, mend shoes &c. and deliver them as they pass on at work. They are not buffered to practise Gaming of any fort. Indeed this is forbidden to all the common people; as playing for any considerable sum is to those of higher rank.

tirely to forego any such emolument. The bedding and cloathing are minutely described, both as to quality and value. I have a copy of all the Orders, twenty-seven in number, dated March 14. 1741. These which I have mentioned may serve for a specimen. Some of the Haves are women: their ward is totally separate from that of the men.

In La Prison ordinaire some rooms are planked all round. Eight of them are very close and strong. Doors of oak 24 inches thick, plated with iron; three hinges, a lock and two padlocks. In a closet, were the cloaths of a person that was murdered, kept to confront the guilty when apprehended; and some stolen goods, to be owned. Here were no prisoners. A criminal who can pay is allowed to expend 7 batz 2 kreutzer, about a Hiilling daily, for two -meals of soup and good bread. To one that is poor, the Government allows half that lum. To all who are condemned, they allow a shilling a day for eight days before they suffer. These allowances are specified on a paper hung up in the Gaol. There also hangs up a serious exhortation concerning the awful nature of an Oath; and the forms of sundry oaths to be taken. I procured copies of the whole, but will transcribe only one oath, as follows: — “ Ma deposition, dont led!are ma etc faite a present, je “ la confirms devant la face du Dieu tout puifj'ant, tout J'achant et vray, pour contenir la verite, ainsi que je defre “ que Dieu we soit en elide fur la fn de mes jours.

In this city I had some discourse with the celebrated Dr. Haller. He ascribed the sickness in English Gaols to their being over-crowded.

AT Solothurn the Prison (dated in.front 1756) is built of a fort of marble from a quarry near the town. Many of the itones are fix feet by two or three, and above a foot thick. The Gaoler said, “ He always took off the irons from criminals that came to him chained hands and feet.” There are fifteen rooms about nine feet square, and eight feet high: with a coach roof. The partition walls are all of the fame fort of marble: the window is in the upper part of

In Scotland also this crime is not frequent. When I was there January 1775, there were no trials: but by inquiring of Gentlemen well-versed in the business of their Courts, I learned that the oath and the form of administering it, are very solemn.

The Magistrates thought a conjlatitsupply of water within the Prison-walls so needful, that although there is a fountain in the street about ten yards from the Prison-door, they have placed another in the court-yard, dated 1769.

AT Basil the Gaol for felons is in one of towers. No prisoners; but many rooms ready with clean straw and blankets. Each pril'oner (they said) has a room to himself, in which he is con faintly shut up, except when conduced to the Council-Chamber for examination. One of the strongest rooms by the great clock is about fix feet high: the (trap) door is in the flat roof: the pril'oner goes down by a ladder, which is then taken up: his victuals are put in at a wicket on one side. When I was in the room, and took notice of the uncommon Rrength of it, the Gaoler told me a prisoner had lately made his el'cape from it. I could not devise what method he took, but heard it was this. He had a spoon for soup, which he fiarpened to cut out a piece from the timber of his room: then by praCice he acquired the art of Rriking his door, just when the great clock struck, to drown the noise: and in fifteen days he forced all the bolts, 6cc.

GERMANY.

THE Germans, well aware of the necessity of Cleanliness in Prisons, have very judiciously chosen to build them in situations most conducive to it; that is, near Rivers: as at Hanover, Zell, Hamburgh, Bremen, Cologne, Mentz and many other places.

In the Gaols that I saw there were but few prisoners, except those calied, improperly, Galley-Slaves. One cause of this, here as in Switzerland, is a speedy trial after commitment.

The Galley-Slaves have every where a P'rifon to themselves. They work on the Roads, the Fortifications, Chalk-Hills, and other public service; for four, seven, ten, fif-

teen, twenty years, according to their crimes: and are cloathed, as well as fed, by the Government. At Wcfel, which belongs to the king of Prussia, there were ninety-eight of these Haves: they have two pounds of bread a day, and the value of three halfpence Englishl every day they work.

I saw no under-ground dungeons in any of the new Prisons in Germany: nor indeed in any new Prison abroad. At Lunenburg the dungeons are diluted: and instead of them are built additional rooms up stairs: one for each prisoner. And in moll of the Gaols each criminal is alone in his room, which is more or less strong, lightsome, and airy, as the crime he is charged with is more or less atrocious.

One often fees the doors of sundry rooms marked Ethiopia, India, Italy, France, England, See. In those rooms, parents, by the authority of the Magistrates, confine for a certain term dissolute children: and if they are inquired after, the answer is, they are gone to Italy, England, See. I

market-days with a basket for prisoners: and 1 have seen him bring them a comfortable meal of fresh vegetables.

But there are separate Prisons in which confinement for a week or two on bread and water is all the punishment for some petty offences. Perhaps, when a condemned criminal is only to live a day or two, such diet may be more proper than the indulgence with which the Germans treat prisoners, after sentence of death, which is commonly executed within forty-eight hours. The malefactor has then his choice of food, and wine, in a commodious room, into which his friends are admitted; and a Minister attends him during almost all his remaining hours.

Debtors: they informed me that they were alimented by their creditors; that they had two pounds of good bread a day, and soup equally good. I was much pleated to find so much of a liberal spirit prevail in this city, that in the Hospital there were separate chambers for Lutherans, in which they were allowed the attendance of their own Ministers.

AT Mentz, La Porte dc Per, which is for Felons, is Mentz. five Stories high: two rooms on a floor: a Spacious landing-place in the middle, with opposite windows, for circulation of air. The rooms are double-floored with oak plank, full two inches thick; and each room has a double door only three

feet nine inches high. Thele two circumstances contribute much to security. On one side the door is a small iron wicket, to put in the daily allowance: which is two pounds of bread, soup, and (except in Lent) a little meat. Only one prisoner is confined in each room, who has a pair of blankets; and once in a fortnight clean straw. This Gaol Hands near the Rhine, and is not in the leail ostensive.

In the House of Correction all was neat, and shewed the attention of the Regency. On my taking notice to the Keeper how clean his Prison was, he said “ How can it “ be otherwise when we have so many women prisoners ? “ Surely they may keep the House clean.” Mofl of the flour for the city is ground at a mill in this Prison. The delinquents work at it two hours in the morning, and two in the afternoon. Over the door is carved a waggon drawn by two Stags, two Lions, and two wild Bears; with an inscription explaining the device, which is, that if wild beads can be tamed to the yoke, we should not despair of reclaiming irregular men. I saw the same bas relief at one or two

other Houses of Correction.

There is a separate Prison for Debtors, near the Fish-Market: Le Port du PoiJJ'ou. No prisoners. When there are any, they have daily at the creditor's cost two pounds of bread, and about four-pence English.

Sect. IV. GERMANY.

Every Prison at Mentz has in each room a German stove; which, in winter, is heated two or three times a day..PriJfoners have clean linen once a week. Gn my observing to the Brigadier of the Police who went with me, how healthy his prisoners looked, he told me that “ Some “ years ago, they were unhealthy; and the Regency re-“moved them from the dungeons under ground: upon “ which they recovered; and had been remarkably healthy “ ever since.” The dungeons are now totally difuTed.

It was hardly necessary to inquire if the Prisons were inspected by proper Officers. The Keepers make a report every day to an attentive Lieutenant of the Police: and once in a fortnight the Coufeiller de Re'gence, the Secretaire and Conseiller des Finances visit every Prison; hear ail complaints 5 and inquire if cloaths, or any thing necessary be wanting. None of the Keepers fell liquor; but prisoners may fend o'ut for a quart of beer a day. They are not allowed to have any Spirituous liquors.

I have related more particulars here, to give a Specimen of the oeconomy observed in other German Prisons, moss of them being governed upon the fame principles; though not all with the fame attention.

former are condemned for three, four, seven, nine, fourteen years: but the term is sometimes diortened on account of good behaviour. These wear a brown uniform; and a small chain from the girdle to one leg. The latter are for the mod: part such as have committed capital offences. These wear a white coat with one black sleeve; and have a chain from the girdle to each leg: they never work out of the town; and are put to the mod: difigrceable services in it. The hours of work for both forts are in summer from five to eleven, and from one to fix: in winter as the weather and length of days permit.

From a charity they have half a dorin (about twelve-pence halfpenny) a month. They are constantly visited by a Deputy from the Regency, who makes his report to the Colonel every morning: and the Colonel conveys it to the young Prince, when he resides at Hanau. Of his kindness to them, the prisoners seemed duly sensible; and they spoke with grateful respecfi: of the attention shewed them by the amiable Pri/icefs his deceased mother, whose memory will be long revered in that country.

I asked one and another of the Honnetes who were at work on the road, “ Whether they liked to be thus employed, or would rather choose to be confined in idleness?”

They'readily answered, “ Much rather be tlius abroad at work.” On Saturday afternoon, these sweep the bridges, the entrances to the town &c. They have a Guard of four Soldiers (bayonets fixed), a Subaltern, and the Keeper. This is the guard, be the number of Haves more or less: when I saw them they were from ten to twelve.

At six in the evening, in summer-time, they bring all their tools into a room in the Prison3 and go to their chambers: the Deshonnetes on the ground floor; the Honnetes above. But in this Prison there is not a separate room for each man 3 as in those to which they were at firjft committed. Each criminal has, besides the cloaths above-mentioned, two pair of shoes 3 two pair of Aockings3 and two shirts. All are obliged to attend Divine Service on Sunday. The men on my repeated visits looked always healthy.

The Deshonnetes are not doomed to despair: but for good behaviour are sometimes promoted to the rank of Honnetes. I conversed with one whom I found very chear-ful for a late advancement of that kind: in consequence of it lie was working on the road.

There is another Prison at Hanau, La Lour de Mar-gueretta: so called from the first person confined in it. It has four rooms on each of the two floors 3 but they were all empty.

Cassel.

AT Cassel there is also a Prison for Galley-Slaves, under similar management, but not so well conducted. One circumstance struck me as worthy of remark. In a fine new Church just built, there is a gallery with two separate feats for the Honnetes and Deshonnetes; though the whole number, when I was there, was only seventeen.

Manheim. AT Manheim Monsieur Babo, Counsellor to the Regency, very politely gave orders to Ihew me every room of La Maison de Force. Prisoners committed to this House are commonly received in form with what is called the Bien-Venu (Welcome). A machine is brought out in which are fastened their neck, hands, and feet. Then they are stripped; and have, according as the Magistrate orders — the Grand Venu of twenty to thirty stripes — the Demi Venn of eighteen to twenty — or the Petit Venn of twelve to fifteen: after this they kiss the threfliold and go in Some are treated with the fame compliment at discharge. The like ceremony is observed at some other towns in Germany.

The House was clean. Fifty-two men, and forty-nine women in several rooms: all at work; either at their own trades, as shoemakers, taylors, weavers, lapidaries; or at one of the manufactures of the House; which are coarse cloth and cards. Not one idle. They have but little time to earn any thing for themselves: yet though they work

The Rules and Orders are good. I have a copy of them all. The two last are to this effect, nth. As it is of the utmod importance in such Houses as this, to observe all possible cleanliness; it is required of all persons to watch moll dridtly against all appearance of the contrary.

That no one may be able to plead ignorance of the Rules, one copy of them shall be given to every prisoner, and another hung up in his room; and they diall be read publicly every Sunday morning after Divine Service. It is ordered that the disobedient be punidied; and that encouragement be given to the dutiful and diligent.

The doors are all numbered; and the keys marked with the corresponding number. Allowance to most of the Men two pounds of bread, soup, and a quart of good beer; and, except in Lent, half a pound of meat. Women have a pound and half of bread: other articles as the men. The sick are indulged with white bread, veal, &c. They have all of them clean linen once a week: it is walked by the women prisoners. The Keeper makes every morning a report

A capuchin fays Mass in the Chapel every morning. A gallery for men; another for women, with a blind before it: another for Orphans, of whom there are sixty-four in a fort of Hospital at one end of the Prison. ProteRants and Jews are ordered to their private devotions: the latter are excused from working on their Sabbath.

Hanover. THE Prison at Hanover was built about thirty years ago. It is situated on the river Leyna. There are eleven Rrong rooms, about ten feet square, and ten and a half high j with a bed of solid Rone in each, eleven inches from the ground, and nine inches higher at the head. Over these are larger apartments for debtors &c. The rooms are warmed by Roves in winter. Criminals have a small chain: they are allowed Rraw to lie on, and two coverlids. When I visited the Prison there were seven criminals and one debtor. The Keeper fells no liquors, but has a salary. In the Council-Chamber are all the various Edicts in frames. There is a Torture-Chamber, but I with pleasure learned that the two cruel engines had not been used for four years.

Lunen-- LUNENBURG. I found the criminals here employed on a different work from any I had before seen: digging Rone

from a large chalk-hill called Kalck-Berg. Others were preparing it for the kiln, grinding, fisting, packing &c. in the warehouses. The casks are about three hundred weight. It is sent to Hamburgh and other distant places, as it makes an excellent cement. Many other men were employed; but the criminals, of whom there were thirty-one, had a chain of about four pounds. Their allowance was a pound and half of bread, and three halfpence in money: provisions much cheaper than in England.

AT Hamburgh Felons in the Butteley were all in irons. Hamburg The common method of execution is decollation. The Executioner, who is Gaoler, shewed me the sword which, he said, he had made use of eight times.

the prisoners having any thing else, what money they bring with them is taken, and sealed up; but it is returned to them when discharged.

In this great city, supposed to contain ninety thousand fouls, there were but three Debtors: and in the neighbouring town Altena, which belongs to the king of Denmark, but two.

IT will perhaps be expected that I should say something of the Houses of Correction at the great and opulent city of Hamburgh. I was there near a week, and visited all the Prisons with every advantage, through the kindness of my friend. Senator Voght. In the great House of Correction, which is a fort of Work-house, and not reckoned infamous, various kinds of work were carrying on; as knitting, spinning, weaving linen, hair, and wool, rasping logwood and hartshorn. A regular book is kept of the earnings, one fourth of which, I was informed, was given to each, as they worked more or less. This House is governed by eight Directors, who must be married men. Two of them visit it every Wednesday and Saturday; on the latter day along with the Ladies, who deliver out the women's work, and have a room for the purpose. Many hundreds are confined here. In the great room I saw about three hundred women and girls all busily employed both times I was

there. Although the House is situated near the Alfter, and visited by Ladies, I cannot say much in favour of its neatness or cleanliness.

In the Spin-House, which is accounted infamous, even the men were not obliged to rasp logwood, but were employed in spinning, in more lightsome rooms than those of the other House. In this were seventy-three prisoners.

AT Bremen the Prison for Debtors has four rooms; Bremen. but the Magistrate who accompanied me, Dr. Hornwinckcl, affined me not one of them had been occupied for above thirty years, till very lately; when one was fitted up for a debtor, who was confined in it a few weeks. Over the door of this Prison is inscribed

Hie fraudum terminus efo.

That there were few Debtors, or none at all, in such towns as Mentz, Cob/entz, Manbeim, &c. may be aferibed to their being places of but little trade. In such large trading cities as Hamburgh, and Bremen, it seems owing to the little credit that is given — the expence of aliment See. falling on the creditor — the being deprived of every kind of amusement and diversion while in Prison — and the disgrace of being the re.

Debtors are not permitted in any German cities that I have seen, to have their wives and children living with them in Prison.

The House of Correction at Bremen, situated on the IVefer, is indeed a House of lndujlry; yet very quiet. There were eleven men, and twenty-eight women, all at work; except a woman who had broke her leg. The ilronger and less docile men rasp Logwood: others weave a set talk of Hair Carpets, &c. The Keeper appoints a weaver in the House to instruct every new comer, who generally teaches him the art in a short time. The women's apartments were very clean: their work is spinning, knitting. See.

The Keeper has a salary; and sells nothing.

I sat an afternoon with Dr. Duntze of Bremen, who told me he was in London in 1753 and 54 with an inquisitive friend, a German. They went into Newgate to observe the effects of the Ventilator , and were struck with an offensive fmcll in one of the rooms. Next day they were both indisposed. The Doctor's complaint turned out a kind of jaundice. After a few days confinement he visited his friend, and found him excessively low; and in a short time he died with every symptom of the Gaol-Fever.

AT Zell in the Eledtorate of Hanover, is a large House of Correction; and

AT Cassel is another, with a work-room one hundred and ten feet by twenty-five, and twelve feet high. It was built by Charles, grandfather to the present Landgrave. I shall not, however, enter into a minute detail of the discipline in these two, and other Houses of the fame fort in Germany. Those in Holland and Flanders are better conduced: and my account of them shall be more particular.

HOLLAND.

PRISONS in the United Provinces are so quiet, and most of them so clean, that a visitor can hardly believe he is in a Gaol. They are commonly (except the Rasp-Houses) white-washed once or twice a year: and a prisoner told me it was no small refreshment to go into their rooms after such a thorough cleaning. A Physician and Surgeon is appointed to every Prison; and prisoners are in general healthy.

In most of the Prisons for Criminals there are so many rooms that each prisoner is kept separate. They never go

120

FOREIGN PRISONS.

out of their rooms: each has a bedstead, straw, and coverlid. But there are few criminals, except those in the Rasp-Houses and Spin-Houses. In all the seven Provinces seldom more executions in a year than from four to fix*. One reason of this, I believe, is the awful solemnity of executions, which are performed in presence of the Magistrates, with great order and seriousness, and great effect on the spectators. I did not fee the process in Holland; but it was particularly described to me, and was similar to what I had been witness of in another place abroad.

The common method of execution is decollation by a broad sword. For the more atrocious crimes, such as premeditated murder &c. the malefactor is broken on the wheel; or rather on a cross laid flat upon the scaffold. But a description of the manner of this execution, which is finished by a Coup de Grace on the brealt, would not be agreeable to any of my readers.

Debtors also are but few. The Magistrates do not approve of confining in idleness any that may be usefully employed. And when one is imprisoned, the Creditor mult pay the Gaoler for his maintenance, from eight to eighteen Rivers a day, according to the Debtor's former condition in

Sect. IV.

121

life. The aliment must be paid every week: in default whereof, the Gaoler gives eight days notice; and if within that time, the money, or security for it, be not brought, the debtor is discharged.

Another reason is, that the situation is very disgraceful. But perhaps the principal cause that debtors, as well as capital offenders, are few, is the great care that is taken to train up the children of the poor, and indeed of all others, to industry. No debtors have their wives and children living with them in Prison: but occasional visits in the day-time are not forbidden. You do not hear in the streets as you pass by a Prison, what I have been rallied for abroad, the cry of poor hungry ft arming Debtors.

The States do not transport criminals: but men are put to labour in the Rasp-Houses, and women to proper work in the Spin-HouJ'es: upon this profeffed maxim. Make them diligent and they veill be honest. The rasping logwood, which was formerly the principal work done by the men criminals, is now in many places performed at the mills, much cheaper: and the Dutch, finding woollen manufactures more profitable, have within these last twelve years, set up several of them in those Houses of Correction. In some, the work does not only maintain the prisoners; but they have a little extra-time to earn somewhat for their beN ter living in Prison, or for their benefit afterwards.

R

122

FOREIGN PRISONS.

Great care is taken to give them moral and religious instruction, and reform their manners, for their own and the public good. The Chaplain (such there is in every House of Correction) does not only perform public worship, but privately instrudts the prisoners, catechises them every week &c. and I am well informed that many come out sober and honed: '*. Some have even chosen to continue and work in the House after their discharge.

Offenders are lentenced to these Houses, according to their crimes, for seven, ten, fifteen, twenty years and upwards: but, to prevent despair, seldom for life. As an encouragement to sobriety and industry, those who distinguish themselves by such behaviour, are discharged before the expiration of their term. A prisoner who gives information of an intended escape is favoured much in this respect: his term is considerably Shortened. A little before the election of new Magistrates, those who are in office inspect these Prisons; and inquire of the Keeper which pri-

” I have heard in England that a countryman of ours, who was'a prisoner in the Rasp-House at jimjicrdam several years, was permitted to work at his own trade, (hoc-making; and by being conttantly kept employed, was quite cured of she vices which brought him to confinement.

foners, of those who have been confined a few years, have, been diligent and orderly: and of the Minister, which of them have been most attentive to public and private instructions. According to the accounts, they contrail the appointed time of punishment: so that fourteen years will sometimes be reduced to eight or ten; and twelve years to six or seven. This practice of abridging the time of punishment upon reformation is in every view wife and beneficial. Indeed, I have some reason to think that criminals are often doomed to a longer term, with an intention to make such deductions upon their amendment.

I was informed that the work done in forne of these Houses of Correction (especially where the men are employed in rasping) does not maintain them: though the men that are robust earn from eight to ten stivers a day; and healthy women by spinning &c. from four to fix. But some earn less; those who are infirm very little: none however are quite idle but the lick. This is surely excellent policy , for besides guarding againsi: the pernicious effects of idleness in a Prison, and breaking criminals to habits of industry, if work so constant does not support the Houses, how much heavier would be the public burden, maintaining the numerous offenders in these Prisons, if, as in many of our Bridewells, no work at all were done there

rooms in most of the Houses of Correction, in which young persons of a vicious and profligate turn are confined on the representation of their parents, till they shew signs of amendment.

AT Amsterdam the Prison is under the Stadt-House. Debtors and felons quite separate. No court-yard. Visitants may converse with debtors at the lattices of their rooms, from nine to twelve in the forenoon. The debtor may buy an anchor of wine to depoftte with die Keeper (who fells liquors): he is allowed to call for a bottle of it a day, paying the Keeper two divers a bottle.

In this city they compute 250,000 fouls*; about one third of those in London: yet in 1775 I found but eighteen debtors, in 1776 only fifteen.

The rooms for criminals are down fifteen flops: ten feet by nine: in each, one prisoner only: a bedstead &c. door-

way twenty-two inches wide; door four inches thick: the condemned rooms have an iron door besides. In the latter a criminal is never left alone: two prisoners from the Rasp-House are always with him, to prevent his destroying himself. They rejoice at the service; for if they discharge it faithfully, their reward is an abridgment of their allotted term. I was credibly informed, that there was no execution here for the lad: two years: and that for a hundred years pad: there have not been, communibus annis, more than one a year. It is generally performed within forty-eight hours after sentence.

In the Stadt-House there were fix delinquents. Their allowance is nine divers a day, for which the Keeper gives them — in the morning, four good dices of bread and butter — at dinner,' rice soup, and two dices of bread — at flipper, milk — besides about a quart of beer a day; and on Sunday three quarters of a pound of meat. He also pays for their weekly diaving, and for wadiing their linen. In some other Provinces the allowance is the fame: in some, more. One of the Magistrates, with whom I was conversing upon the subject of English Prisons, said “ Nourish “ your prisoners well, and keep them in dry rooms, and “ they will be healthy.”

In some rooms, where they also deep, were ten or twelve men rasping an appointed talk. Others were in the warehouses, sorting and weighing; others bringing the wood to those rooms. If any one be idle, or refractory &c. he is shut up in a place of closer confinement under ground. I saw one who was so punished for burning logwood: he told me his sentence was for six weeks. On careful inquiry, I learned, that what has been said of a celiar, in which such transgressors are put to pump or drown, is not fact. Hours of work from fix to twelve, and from one to four. In extra-hours they make tobacco-boxes &c. which they fell to visitants, who pay two divers to go in They are daily visited by the Medical Faculty; and have in general a healthy look. I wished to know more particulars of this famous Prison; but could scarce ever get from the cautious old Keeper a direct anfsver to any one question: though I paid him five visits with that intent. I could not go into the rooms till last time I was there, when a Magistrate accompanied me. The Keeper was dill as much upon the reserve as before: but without alking him, I saw his prison-was dirty.

In the spin-house (Spin-huis) you fee a number of women criminals (there were thirty-two) some of whom had been the most abandoned; fitting in presence of the Mijlrefs, quiet and orderly at their different forts of work; spinning, plain work &c. Of the latter fort much is sent in from the city. Hours of work from fix to twelve, and from one to eight. I saw them go from work to dinner: the Keeper as they call him Father prelided. First they fang a Psalm: then they went in order down to a neat dining-room; where they seated themselves at two tables; and several dishes of boiled barley, agreeably sweetened, were set before them. The Father struck with a hammer: then in profound silence all flood up; and one of them read with propriety, a Prayer about four or five minutes. Then they fat down chearful; and each filled her bowl, from a large dish which contained enough for four of them. Then one brought on a waiter dices of bread and butter, and served each prisoner.

As I staid longer than a common visitant, one of the prisoners went up to the Miffrefs with the timid modeffy of a suppliant, and asked leave to offer me the plate. The leave was granted. The Mistress keeps what is given, till it amounts to a sum sufficient to purchase a little Tea or Coffee, for all to partake.

Dol- Huis. I will just mention the dol-huis, an Hospital for the Insane: because it would (in my opinion) be a good plan for a Bridewell, with the addition of working rooms. The ground plot is rectangular: the Keeper's house takes up one of the shorter tides: the other three fides have, on the ground-floor, rooms in the recess of a walk full eight feet wide, under arcades; inclosed from the area or garden by a wall to the height of four feet: the upper part to the crown of the arch, open. Each person has a separate room, with two doors; the inner door is latticed; the outer, frequently Hands open. Over the doors is an aperture in the wall, about a foot square. These rooms are for the Poor. Above are larger rooms for those whose friends can pay for them. Common visitants are not allowed to go up: but, injudiciously, every one that pays four stivers is admitted below. The windows all round open to the court-yard, none outwards.

Hague. AT the Hague I was honoured with the very polite assistance of Sir Joseph Torke. A Magistrate accompanied me to the Prison; where all was quiet and in order. The same Gentleman presented me with a copy of Instructions to the Sheriff of the Court; a copy of Rules for Officers of the

The Rules for Officers of the Attorney-General, and of the Sheriff have an admirable effect in preserving peace, and order. There are thirty-two of them. I cannot forbear abstracting a few. No officer to ffir out of town without special leave: and while in town each muff always give notice where he may be found. In case of fire they muff immediately repair to the Court-Gate for inffrudtions. Arreffs of delinquents muff be performed quietly. No officer to serve or watch inffead of another. Neglect of duty through drunkenness is punished with living in Prison on bread and water at their own expence for three days, eight days, and at last, with discharge. They may not keep company with any persons in public houses <Scc. Giving ill language is punished by a fine: quarrels, at discretion of the Magistrates. Not giving information of defaulters is punished with discharge. They are to guard against being guilty of ill behaviour of any fort, that no dishonour may be caff upon the Court of Judicature. Each officer to have a copy of the Rules, and keep it to shew on demand, on pain of a fine. The whole to be read to them all together by the Sheriff once a month.

AT Groxixgen the Rq/p and Spin-House together, has on the ground-floor rooms for men. In the floor above it are four apertures two feet by three and a half each into the wool warehouse above. These were lately made by the advice of a judicious Physician (a Profefi'or), who thought

the men's rooms not sufficiently airy, though they have of-pofite windows; the men sleeping as well as working in them: on which account they are still somewhat offensive.

Women have a work-room, and a lodging-room quite separate: both of them very clean. All the prisoners are employed on a woollen manufacture.

AT Lewarden the Rasp-House had in it thirty-four Lewarden. men: a few of them rasping Logwood, with an instrument composed of ten saws united: others combing and spinning black wool: others spinning twine; weaving sacks, and coarse linen cloth &c. At their leisure they make £hoe-pegs, tobacco-stoppers, sugar-saucers of brass wire &c. and fell them to visitants. In the Spin-House adjoining, were thirty-six women: all at work, preparing thread &c. except one, whom the Mistress, going up with me from her breakfast, found idle in a warehouse; and not only rated her for it sufficiently, but entertained me with her murmurs upon the offence a good while after; from whence I concluded the fault was not a very common one.

AT Utrecht no prisoners in the Stadt-House. The Utrecht. Keeper told me the allowance was twelve stivers a day:

“ for, said he, confinement here is not meant as punishmentj but only as safe custody till trial *. After which,

The fame observation I remember was made to me by the Keeper at Nimcguen, where the allowance is ten stivers. Here also were no prisoners.

Delft.

“some who are to be punished by a short imprisonment “ are sent to another Prison, where they live on bread and “ water only.” He said a woman who had been his prisoner, was that day sentenced to be so punished for a fortnight: but he added, “ She will have a sufficient quantity; and if flie be ill, her food will be altered.”

AT Delft there were near ninety in the House of Correction: men and women quite separate: all neat and clean, and looked healthy. They told me their allowance was five Rivers a day *. All employed on a woollen manufacture — women spinning, carding 6cc. — men weaving from coarse to very fine Cloth: their talk, to earn thirty-five Rivers a week. Some earn a small surplus; but they have only half of it. A BurgomaRer, to whom I mentioned that circumstance, said it was the truth. They do not put more than eight or ten men to work in one room: for when large numbers are together, one idle person corrupts more; and there is not generally so much work done. Here also, if a prisoner has behaved well for a few years, and given proofs of amendment, the MagiRrates begin to abridge the time for which he was sentenced. One whom I saw very cheerful,

AT Rotterdam in the Prison under the Stadt-House were neither debtors nor felons. In the Rasp and Spin-House about forty men and a hundred women. The former, three or four in a room, making Fiffbig-Nets, carding Wool, sorting Coffee See. Women mostly employed on a manufacture of Worjled, spinning, and working at a great' wheel like those which at Derby are turned by water.

THE pest-house across the Maes opposite Rotterdam' is a spacious building in a small isle. It is nearly a square of one hundred and thirty feet: has four spacious wards which are about thirty feet wide and twenty high. I mention this edifice, not only as it occurred to me that it. would be a good plan for a House of Correction, being airy, and built round a court in which is a bason of water communicating with the Maes; but on account of the sentiments of veneration it inspired, when I trod on the ground under which such piles of my brave countrymen lie buried; it having been used as a Military Hospital. after the siege of Bergen-of-Zoonu

HE French Provinces here and in the Netherlands

are chiefly governed by the fame Arret de Par lenient as their Provinces in France. I will therefore mention only one circumstance at Arras in Artois which was different from what I had seen in France. Of one hundred and thirty-nine prisoners in this Gaol, I saw two in the court-yard who had irons. But upon asking one of them the reason of it, he told me “ it was for attempting an escape.”

IN the Austrian Netherlands I found the Prisons in general clean; and no sickness prevailing in any one of them: and yet few of the Prisons have a court-yard: in moll of them every prisoner is confined to his room. In some places, as at Antwerp &c. the allowance to Criminals is scanty; a pound of bread a day, and a pound of butter a week: but the deficiency is fully made up by supplies from the Monasteries &c. Debtors very few: alimented by creditors.

Sect. IV. FLANDERS.

AT Brussels twenty-four Fe/ons: daily allowance two pounds of bread ffain de munition) and some soup: on Sunday, except in Lent, a pound of meat. A Keeper of the House of Correction was lately committed to this Gaol for abuse of his trust. Debtors are sent to another Prison: the creditor is obliged to advance a month's aliment. In that Prison I saw an Englishmen who had his wife and two or three children with him; but they were not permitted to stay at night.

VILFORDE. The House of Correction now building near this town for all the provinces of Aujlrian Brabant, is upon the largest scale of any structure of the kind that I have seen. It is situated upon the great canal leading to Brnff'els; and is almost surrounded by water. The ground plot, a plan of which I have by me, is redtangular, except a sweep before the court of the Governor's house. The longer fides are about two hundred and ten yards; the shorter about one hundred and sixty-seven. At the back of one of the longer fides, fronting the West, I counted eighty windows on a floor. There are the fame number opposite, looking inwards towards the courts. Each of these belongs to a separate room or cell, near fix feet and a half by five and a half, and eight feet high; and a long passage eight feet and a half wide runs through each floor, into which all the opposite rooms open. Two floors of this side are finillied, making three hundred and twenty rooms; there

are two more, as yet unfinished, of the fame number of rooms. Each of the two ihorter fidcs has one hundred and seventy-six rooms, of the fame size as the others, and on as many floors. Part of these Hides are finished; so that, including some rooms on each side the Governor's house, about five hundred are now ready of the nine hundred and ninety-two. On some vacant ground at the Ihorter iides more rooms will be built if wanted. Of so great importance is it wifely judged by these Provinces to keep every prisoner at night by himself, that this vast number of rooms is contrived that each may lodge one person only.

On each side the cate of the court before the Governor's house is a Porter's lodge. Prisoners will pass this way to their respective wards behind the House. Those committed for life will be quite separate from those who are for a limited term: and men totally so from women; not only in their Wards, Work-rooms, and Refectories; but also in'two dif-tinct Chapels. These Chapels are oCtagons of about thirty-five feet; and on each floor the prisoners will have a room looking into them. The work-rooms are numerous; about forty feet by twenty: some up stairs, others under ground for weaving fine linen: but no prisoners are to sleep under ground. Staircases all stone, fix feet wide: some dark cells for confining the refractory. A Kitchen forty-seven feet by thirty-four: Make house, and Slaughter house large in proportion, and commodious. Convenient apartments for

several Chaplains: and proper rooms for a military guard.

No prisoners as yet: and two spacious Infirmaries designed, are not begun.

AT Mechlin one of the best rooms in the Prison is for Mechlin. Debtors: but none in it. Three criminals up stairs: no dungeons. Allowance, two sixpenny loaves and a pound of butter weekly: on Sunday a pound of meat, and some soup: three pints of small beer daily. Straw, and two blankets. Firing from the ill of November to the 1 ft of May. Clean linen every week from a charity. I will not describe the mode of ‘Torture.

AT Bruges there is to the Prison a court-yard for Bruges. Criminals, and another for Debtors: but the former are never let out. Each fort has a daily allowance in money, about three-pence halfpenny English: provisions rather cheaper than in London: a clean shirt every week. Debtors have the allowance from their Creditors; who also pay the Keeper a small fee at the entrance of the prisoner, and a penny a day during his confinement. No under-ground dungeons. Two things are remarkable in this Prison, and well worth imitating. One is the care they take of the Sick. There are two Medical Books, one for the City, the other for the Seigtieuries or Loraships of Parishes, which are governed by different Magistrates, but the Prison is common to both. The Physician at every visit enters his

in the respective Book, which is carried to the Apothecary; who after copying the Recipe, fends the book back again; and it is kept in the room where the Magistrates meet to hold a Court of Judicature, inspect the Prison &c. I spent some hours in looking over them. The prescriptions are written with regularity for many years pail: . Bark and Cordials were almost constant ingredients in the Recipe. They are not troubled with infectious distempers; but perhaps the Physicians are somewhat apprehensive of them, and order those preventives with success. The Physician orders a Surgeon to attend when the case requires one: and at his order also the Keeper provides for the sick. Soup, white Bread &c. the Magistrates allowing for this Fourteen-pence a day, to continue till countermanded by the Physician. Some sick prisoners have been many weeks thus liberally provided for.

The other exemplary practice is their care of Legacies and Donations. In the Council-Chamber, under a picture representing visiting the sick, feeding the hungry, and releasing the prisoner, there is in a frame a printed Lift of all Charities given or bequeathed to the Prisoners from the year 1315 to 1734; with the names and intentions of the several Donors: and in another small frame is a memorial of the time at which each bequest is to be distributed.

each criminal has from the city about four-pence halfpenny English, a day: and provision being the re about one third cheaper than in London, some of them save a little out of that allowance after paying for the weekly washing of their linen.

In the State Prison, governed by other Magistrates, criminals have four-pence a day. In each of those Prisons the Keeper has from the Magistrates two-pence a day for the custody of every prisoner. In the two Prisons, four debtors.

Here is a Prison belonging to the rich Monastery of Benedictines in the Abbey of St. Peter. There arc now thirty-five of the fraternity: who have many Lordships, and part of the City in their jurisdiction. The Prison joins to the Abbot's Court-House. Three dreary dungeons down nineteen heps: a little window in each: no prisoners. I went down; but my noting the dimensions of the windows &c. so enraged the Keeper, that he would not indulge my curiosity any farther.

The House of Correction for the City of Ghent is not so commodiously built, nor kept so clean as some other Flemish Prisons: but there are very good Rules of Oeco-norny, of which I have a copy. Every prisoner is examined at his first coming; and if he be not healthy, he is

not put among those that are so. That the Keeper may not be tempted to oppress his prisonere, he is exempted from all Taxes. The prisoners have a set talk of different forts of work: the profits of extra-work their own. The Ma-giltrates meet in the Prison once a week to inspect it; and to appoint the fort and quantity of provision for every day of the week ensuing. They order the Physician to fee that the lick have broth, and other nourishment proper for them. The Keeper provides it and is paid by the Magistrates. I happened to go into the Prison while they were there, and saw them employed as above.

I beg leave here, on account of the humanity of its in-ftitution, to digress from my subject by taking notice of a Nunnery in this place. The Hospitable Manjion is not inhabited solely by Nuns; it is destined to the reception of men who are insane, and sick aged women. The insane Kave, when requisite, assistance from their own sex; and the ten-dernefs with which both these and the poor women are treated by the fiiters, gave me no little pleasure.

La Maison de Force.

There is at Ghent a new Prison building by the States of Aitjlrian Flanders. It is a House of Correction for all those Provinces (as that at Vilforde for Aujlrian Brabant) and is called la maison de force. It is situated near a Canal. The plan is an Octagon: only four fides finished; in one of them were in 1775 one hundred and fifty-nine men criminals:

On each of the four floors there is a corridor, or areade, fix feet nine inches wide, quite open to the air of the yard, which, however, is not attended with any inconvenience, even in winter. In the recess of every corridor, except the lowest: , is a range of bed-rooms, fix feet nine inches by four feet ten, and eight feet eight inches high: the doorway two feet. These are uniformly furnished with a bed-stead, fix feet and a half by two and a half, a straw bed, a mattress, a pillow, a pair of sheets, two blankets in winter and one in summer. Each room has a little bench, and a shutter to the lattice window (in the door), which, when opened and turned down, serves for a table. In the wall is a little cupboard, two feet by one, and ten inches deep. All the rooms are vaulted to prevent fire from running from story to flory. No person is on any pretence admitted into the bed-room of another. They have a clean shirt once a week, and clean sheets once a month. The women have not separate rooms. Some of theirs are ten feet and a half by nine and a half.

In order to the admission of a prisoner, previous notice -mull be given by the City or Province that fends him.

Half an hour after the bell rings, their names are called over 3 and they go to Prayers in a Chapel. They are then allowed half an hour to breakfast. At noon they have two hours, for dinner 3 making their beds (which in fair weather they bring out to air) 3 and for recreation. I was present during the whole time the men criminals were at dinner, and much admired the regularity, decency, and order, with which the whole was conduced. Every thing was done at a word given by a Director 3 no noise or confusion appeared 3 and this company of near one hundred and ninety flout criminals was governed with as much apparent ease as the most l'ober and well-disposed assembly in civil society. At night they have an hour for supper &c. The bell gives notice of all these successive hours: it is rung at a window over the gate-way by a Centinct, who there overlooks the whole yard 3 and, should there be any disturbance, is to give the alarm to a company who keep guard.

I saw in it — often excuse — fomethnes make up in next piece — sometimes to work alone — to bread and water — seldom to rasping logwood. The daily allowance is two pounds of bread; some soup of beans, pease &c. with wheat-bread in it; and except Friday and Lent half a'pound of cold meat. Each prisoner has also the value of our farthing, for which he can buy near two pints of finall beer; or somewhat else which the victualler of that Prison is allowed to fell, and deliver to them at a wicket in the wall. Spirituous liquors are expressly prohibited: and so is wine, unless it be ordered by a note from the Physician.

It is not allowed to give any thing direCHy to the prisoners: but there is a box into which money may be put; and at Rated times it is equally distributed among them. Cards, Dice, and all gaming are strictly forbidden: and there are excellent Rules for preventing all quarreling; for mending their morals; preserving their health; and making them for the future useful in Society. To transcribe all the Rules would to moil readers be disagreeable. Such as wish to fee them will hud them, together with more particulars of this noble Institution, in two Edicts printed in folio at Ghent in 1773 and 75: the first in French and Low Dutch; the latter only French: and in a book in quarto written by Count Vilain XIV. and offered to the Government in 1775. The title of it is Memoire fur les Moyens de corriger les Haifa it eurs et Fa in cans a lent' propre Av ant age et de les rendre Utiles a J'Etat. A Gaud See.

I SAID

FLANDERS.

I said transcribing all the Rules at length, would be tedious; for this reason I have only given extracts from these, and from those made for other Foreign Prisons. I have compleat copies of them, and of others which I have not mentioned; some printed, others M. S. which I will readily show to any Gentleman who has leisure and inclination to study the subject.

WHEN I formerly made the tour of Europe, I seldom had occasion to envy Foreigners any thing I saw with respect to their Situation, their Religion, Manners or Government. In my late journeys to view their Prisons, I was sometimes put to the blush for my native country. The Reader will scarcely feel from my narration the fame emotions of shame and regret as the comparison excited in me, on beholding the difference with my own eyes. But from the account I have given him of Foreign Prisons, he may judge whether a design of reforming our own be merely visionary — whether Idleness, Debauchery, Disease, and Famine be the necessary attendants of a Prison, or only connected with it in our ideas for want of more perfect knowledge, and more enlarged views. I hope too he will do me the justice to think that neither an indiscriminate admiration of every thing foreign, nor a fondness of censuring every thing at home, has influenced me to adopt the language of a Panegyrist in this part of my work, or that of a Complainant in the red.

U Where

146

FOREIGN PRISONS.

Where I have commended I have mentioned my reasons for so doing; and I have dwelt perhaps more minutely upon the management of Foreign Prisons, because it was more agreeable to me to praise than to condemn. Another motive induced^ me to be very particular in my accounts of Foreign Houses of Correction, especially those of the freed: States. It was to counteract a notion prevailing among us that compelling prisoners to work, especially in public, was inconsistent with the principles of English Liberty; at the same time that taking away the lives of such numbers, either by executions, or the diseases of our Prisons, seems to make little impression upon us. Of such force is custom and prejudice in silencing the voice of good sense and humanity

I have only to add that, fully sensible of the imperfection which mull attend the cursory survey of a traveller, it was my study to remedy that defect by a constant attention to the one object of my pursuit alone, during the whole of my two last journeys abroad.

SECTION

SECTION V.

A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF ENGLISH PRISONS.

AS the Tables of which the present Section will chiefly consist, contain several terms which cannot be expected to be familiar to the generality of my Readers, I shall begin with an explanation of them.

IN the first: page of every County, City, See. the second article of the Gaoler or Keeper's emolument is Fees; by which are meant such only as are taken by him and his servants on the admission or discharge of a Prisoner. The sums set down under this head are from the befl information I could procure in my repeated journeys j but they differ sometimes from those specified in the Tables of Fees where such are found.

The next article under Gaoler is Transports. The sum set down to this, is what (from the best intelligence I

148

ENGLISH PRISONS.

could gain) I found was allowed them for conveying convicts sentenced to transportation to the respective sea-ports j and for paying the Merchant who contracts what he was supposed to demand for their passage: although by the fla-tutes 4th George I. and 8th of his present Majesty, it is

enacted that “ The person or persons so contracting

“ shall have a Property and Interest in the service of the “ said offenders for such Terms of years.”

Under Prisoners in the fame page, the number which I found in the respective County-Gaol on my different visits is distinguished into Debtors and Felons The &c. is

meant to include two kinds of Prisoners chiefly; viz. Fines and Petty Offenders. By Fines is understood such as' are confined till they pay a sum of money, a Fine: — such as are obliged to find security for good behaviour: — and such as are committed for a limited term to mere confinement, or (which is much the fame) to hard labour. Of these latter most have been previously whipped, or burnt in the hand. The Petty Offenders are such as are sent to Gaols instead of Bridewells, for reasons mentioned in a former Session. These also in some Gaols are called Fines. Besides these there are some times a few Deserters.

Wherever there were Fables of Fees I thought myself obliged to give exact and literal copies of them: I am not therefore answerable for the improprieties of expression or

defects.

ENGLISH PRISONS.

149

defeats of form to be found in some of them. The articles and sums, I say, in these Tables are literally copied; but I have taken the liberty, in order to prevent tiresome and useless repetitions, to abridge the formalities of preamble and conclusion. For the same reason, I have used the fame liberty, with regard to the Rules and Orders of the few Prisons that have such; and to the Lifts of Benefactions and Legacies. Where no mention is made of Rules &c. it may be concluded that there are none hung up in that Prison. Where there is no ‘Table of Fees I commonly note the defect*.

I have described no Prison but from my own examination at the several dates set down before the number of Prisoners. I entered every room, cell, and dungeon with a memorandum-book in my hand, in which I noted particulars upon the spot. My descriptions will to some readers appear too minute; but I chose rather to relate circumstances, than to characterize in general terms. By these, the Legidature will be better acquainted with the real Hate of Gaols; and Magistrates will be able to judge whether

It should be observed that by the statute ;2d George II. if any Gaoler, or Keeper, demand Fees not set down in a Table signed by the Justices, and afterwards confirmed by the Judge or Judges of Assize, and Justices, and hung up conspicuous in the Prison; such demand is illegal, and the Offender is liable to a penalty of fifty pounds to the person injured.

the Prisons over which they preside, and to which they commit offenders, be fit for the purposes they are designed to answer. I might add, that a variety of descriptions may possibly fuggefi something useful in the plans of such Prisons as may hereafter be erected; since whatever may appear worth copying may be extracted from any.

I have here and there taken the liberty of pointing out what seemed to me, as I viewed a Prison, an obvious remedy of some defect that happened to strike me. But I did not examine with the accuracy of a Surveyor; and hope I shall not be thought to direct in the Ryle of a Didtator.

newgate. slant feats of disease, and sources of infection; to the destruction of multitudes, not only in the Prison, but abroad. The City had therefore very good reason for their resolution to build a new Gaol. The Plate will give a better idea of it than any description. I give the plan, rather to gratify the curiosity of my Readers, than as a model to be followed. Many inconveniences of the old Gaol are avoided in this new one: but it has some manifest errors. It is now too late to point out particulars. All I will say, is, that without more than ordinary care, the prisoners in it will be in great danger of the Gaol-Fever.

The Cells built in Old Newgate a few years since for condemned malefactors, are intended for the fame use at present. I shall therefore give some account of them. There are upon each of the three floors five cells: all vaulted, near nine feet high to the crown. The cells on the ground-floor measure full nine feet by near fix; the five on the first story are a little larger, on account of the set-off in the wall; and the five uppermost, Hill a little larger for the same reason. In the upper part of each cell, is a window double grated, near three feet by one and a half. The doors are four inches thick. The strong Pone wall is lined all round each cell with planks, studded with broad-headed nails. In each cell is a barrack-bedflead. I was told by those who attended me, that criminals who had affected an air of boldness during their trial, and appeared quite unconcerned at the pronouncing sentence upon them, were struck with horror, and shed tears when brought to these darksome solitary abodes.

The New Chapel is plain and neat. Belov; are three or four pews for men felons &c. On each side is a gallery: that towards the women's ward is for them: in it is a pew for the Keeper, whose presence

LONDON. 153

fence may set a good example and be otherwise useful. The other newgate. gallery towards the debtors ward is for them. The stairs to each gallery are on the outside of the Chapel.

I went once to Prayers there. Mr. Villette read them distinctly, and with propriety; the few prisoners who were present, seemed attentive: but we were disturbed by the noise in the yard. Mr. Villette told me “ that was always the case, even on Sundays.” Surely they who will not go to Chapel, who are by far the greater number, should not be suffered to hinder the edification of such as are better disposed.

The Chaplain (or Ordinary) besides his salary, has a House in Newgate-street, clear of Land-Tax; two Freedoms yearly, which commonly fell for twenty-five pounds each; Lady Barnadifton's Legacy, six pounds a year; an old Legacy paid by the Governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, ten pounds a year; the City generally presents him once in six months with another Freedom. He engages when chosen to hold no other living.

Debtors have every day from the Chamber of London sixteen stone of beef: Fines eight stone: and some years Felons eight stone. Debtors have several Legacies. I inquired for a list of them, and Mr. Akerman told me “ The Table in Maitland's Survey, which he shewed me, was authentic. ” The amount of it is £53 ‘.5: 8 a year. He said there were also a few more.

TO this Prison were committed formerly those who incurred the displeasure of the Star-Chamber. In the 16th of Charles I. when that Court was abolished, it became a Prison for Debtors; and for

persons

LONDON.

persons charged with contempts of the Courts of Chancer}', Exchequer, and Common Pleas.

In 1728 many abuses practised by the Warden were the subject of parliamentary inquiry.

The Prison was rebuilt a few years since. At the front is a narrow court-yard. At each end of the building, there is a small projection, or wing. There are four floors, they call them Galleries, besides the cellar-floor, called Bartholomew-Fair. Each gallery consists of a passage in the middle, the whole length of the Prison, i. e. sixty-flx yards; and rooms on each side of it about fourteen feet and a half by twelve and a half, and nine and a half high. A chimney and window in every room. The passages are narrow (not seven feet wide) and darkish, having only a window at each end.

On the first floor, the Hall-Gallery, to which you afeend eight steps, are, a Chapel, a Tap-room, a Coffee-room (lately made out of two rooms for Debtors), a room for the Turnkey, another for the Watchman, and eighteen rooms for Prisoners.

Besides the Coffee-room and Tap-room, two of those eighteen rooms, and all the cellar-floor, except a lock-up room to confine the disorderly, and another room for the Turnkey, are held by the Tap-fter, John Cartwright, who bought the remainder of the lease at public audtion in 1775. The cellar-floor is sixteen steps below the hall-gallery. It consists of the two rooms just now mentioned, the Tapster's kitchen, his four large beer and wine celiars, and fifteen rooms for Prisoners. These fifteen, and the two before-

mentioned

fleet. mentioned on the hall-gallery* the Tapster lets to Prisoners for four to eight shillings a week*.

Os the first Gallery (that next above the hall-gallery) are twenty-five rooms for Prisoners. On the second Gallery twenty-seven rooms. One of them, fronting the staircase, is their Committee-room. A room at one end is an Infirmary. At the other end in a laige room over the Chapel is a dirty Billiard-table; kept by the Prisoner who fleeps in that room. On the highest story are twenty-seven rooms. Some of these upper rooms, viz. those in the wings, are larger than the rest; being over the Chapel, the Tap-room, &c.

All the rooms I have mentioned are for Master's-side Debtors. The weekly rent of those not held by the Tapster is one shilling and three-pence unfurnished. They fall to the Prisoners in succession, thus: when a room becomes vacant, the first Prisoner upon the lift of such as have paid their entrance-fees, takes possession of it. When the Prison was built, the Warden gave each Prisoner his choice of a room according to his leniority as Prisoner. If all the rooms be occupied, a new comer must hire of some tenant a part of his room; or ftiift as he can. Prisoners are excluded from all right of succesilon to the rooms held by the Tapster, and let at the high rents aforesaid.

The apartments for Common-side Debtors are only part of the right wing of the Prison. Besides the cellar (which was intended

' An imposition of the fame kind is noted in the Report of the Gaol-Committee 1728.

for

LONDON.

for their kitchen, but is occupied with lumber, and Unit up) there are four floors. On each floor is a room about twenty-four or twenty-five feet square, with a fire-place; and on the fides seven closets or cabins to sleep in Such of these Prisoners as swear in Court or before a Commissioner that they are not worth five pounds, and cannot subsist without charity, have the donations which are sent to the Prison, and the begging-box, and grate. Of them there were at my lafi: visit sixteen.

I have in the Report of the Committee of the House of Commons 1728 a Table of some Charities: but I saw no such Table in the Prison.

There is plenty of water from the river and pumps: and a lpa-cious yard behind the Prison.

I mentioned the billiard-table. They also play in the yard at Ikittles, miflifippi, fives, tennis. See. And not only the Prisoners: I saw among them 'several butchers and others from the market; who are admitted here as at another public house. The fame may be seen in many other Prisons where the Gaoler keeps or lets the tap. Besides the inconvenience of this to Prisoners; the frequenting a Prison lessens the dread of being confined in one.

On Monday night there is a Wine-Club: on Thursday night a Beer-Club: each lasting ulually till one or two in the morning. I need not say how much riot these occasion; and how the sober Prisoners are annoyed by them.

THIS Prison for Debtors who are free of the City, for Clergy- Remarks, men, Proctors and Attorneys, was formerly a Bridewell to the London Work-house adjoining.

On the ground-door are, a long-room, a tap-room, and a kitchen.

In each of them is a staircase; leading first to eleven rooms for Master-side Debtors — viz. over the long-room, a sizeable chamber, and a room on each of the two floors above: over the tap-room, four small rooms, which have iron bars at the windows, and a larger room above them: over the kitchen, a sizeable chamber, and two rooms above. The Common-side Debtors are in two large garrets, the Forest and Dock.

The Prison is out of repair. No regard has been paid to the Act, which enjoins white-washing &c. A small Court-yard, with a Cistern for river-water. No Infirmary. The Chapel is common to the Prison and Work-house.

The City allowance is ten Itone of beef a week: to which has been added since the 9th of February 1776, a penny loaf a day for each Prisoner. The Lord Mayor and Sheriffs fend annually coals:

King's Ward, in which were twenty-four Debtors; and the Prince's Ward, nine Debtors. In each of these wards, some Prisoners (for tvant of more room) deep on a broad shelf or cabin over those on the lower beds. Above those wards are the Middle Ward, in it were twenty Debtors; and the Women's Ward, two Debtors. Above them are the Upper Ward, eleven Debtors j and the Jews Ward*, four Jew Debtors. Near the middle ward, on the fame floor, is a close darkish room for the sick. In each ward, a fire-place. The rooms are out of repair: and no regard has been paid to the late Act for white-washing &c. but the Debtors keep the floors veiy clean. The yard is small, but that also is clean: the water constantly running.

The Tap-room is in the Court-yard. Adjoining to it is the Felons Day-room, the Bell. Their Night-rooms, one for men, another for women, are up Hairs. But the women's room was once occupied for a workshop by a Prisoner, a cooper , and the women slept in the Bell below. No straw or bedding.

On one side of the Court-yard is a Chapel; with a narrow gallery all round for Master's-side Debtors. A man who is not in orders preaches on Sunday mornings; and gives the Prisoners books, or a little money: they spoke of him respectfully. The Chapel, and indeed the whole of this Prison, is quite out of repair.

At the roof of the Prison, all round, are spacious leads, on which the Master's-side Debtors are sometimes allowed to walk: but then the Keeper is with them: for the leads communicate with the ad- joining

Besides the penny loaf a day, which is from the Chamber of London, there are some Legacies: and the Prisoners (the Debtors) have also from the Peacock-brewhouse (Messrs- Calvert's and Co.) a kind donation of two barrels of small beer a week.

In this Prison eight men had with them their wives and nineteen children. The other Prisoners, I learned, had forty-four wives and one hundred and forty-four children, not in the Gaol?

THIS Prison, built, as appears by infeription on rite front, in 1670, has only a small Court-yard or Passage for all Prisoners. Many apartments: yet but two rooms for Common-side Debtors: that for the men, which is their day-room, night-room, and kitchen, with a copper &c. is dark and dirty; about thirty-five feet by

eighteen.

eighteen, and sixteen feet high; far too small for the number of Prisoners; many of whom sleep in twenty-three beds which are on three stories of galleries, or broad shelves. At one of my visits there were in this room thirty-nine Debtors; seven of them had their wives and children. The room swarms with bugs. The day and night-room for Women Debtors is more lightsome: in it were only two Prisoners. Beyond it is a room ruinous, and fit for no use.

WOOD-STREET COMPTER.

For Men Felons there are two rooms: and two for Women: one of these is a dark cell. No bedding or straw. Those who choose a bed pay a drilling a night: or else ten drillings and six-pence floorage, and three drillings and six-pence a week.

Near those four rooms are twenty-three rooms for Master's-dde Debtors.

In the Court-yard is the Chapel: and under it the Tap-room, down sixteen flcps.

All the rooms aforesaid are within the inner gate; between which and the outer gate (i. e. in the Keeper's house) are more rooms for Master's-side Debtors.

The Prison is greatly out of repair: the main wall on one side, shored and propped. No Infirmary.

The Keeper pays to the Chamber of London £2° a year rent, which is repaid him for Fees of the poorest Prisoners. He also pays Window-tax ^5: 1: 0.

I learned from him that in the beginning of the year 1773 his Prisoners were sickly, and eleven died. Since that time the Governors of the General Dispensary have shewn a kind attention to these poor people; and ordered their Physician, Dr. Lett/om, to

visit them. He is esteemed by the Prisoners: and at my last visits, all were well.

The allowance of a penny loaf is from the Chamber of London. Debtors (some of whom are from the Court of Conscience) have from the Peacock-brewhouse (Mefl'rSi Calvert and Co.) a donation of two barrels of small beer a week: and from the Sheriffs thirty-two pounds of beef on Saturday. 'Mr. Taylor, formerly a baker, has for some years sent them weekly a large leg and flrin of beef.

There are many Legacies for Common-side Debtors, who receive them quarterly. The annual amount is £59: 2: 11.

Some years since, there came once a fortnight to common-side debtors in this prison, nine stone of beef, and fourteen quartern loaves: and the like relief to other prisons also. The charitable hand was concealed; till, the donation failing on the death of the amiable princess Caroline, it was supposed that her highness had been the generous benefactress. And upon representing to the Lady who had been Almoner to the Princess, the distress of the Prisoners, she obtained from the King a Renewal of the Charity; which was continued during his Majesty's life.

BRIDEWELL

IN BLACK-FRYARS.

THIS building was formerly a Palace, near St. Bridget's (St. Bride's) Well; from whence it had the name; which, after it became a Prison, was applied to other Prisons of the fame fort *. It was given to the City by King Edward VI. in 1552.

That part of Bridewell which relates to my subject has wards for men and women quite separate. — The men's ward on the ground-floor is a day-room in which they beat hemp; and, down a step, their night-room. One of the upper chambers is fitting up for an Infirmary. — The women's ward is a day-room on the ground-floor, in which they beat hemp; and a night-room over it. I was told that the chamber above this is to be fitted up for an Infirmary. The sick have, hitherto, been commonly sent to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. All the Prisoners are kept within doors.

The women's rooms are large, and have opposite windows, for fresh air. Their ward, as well as the men's, has plenty of water: and there is a Hand-Ventilator on the outside, with a tube to each room of the women's ward. This is of great service, when the rooms are crowded with Prisoners, and the weather is warm.

The Prisoners are employed by a Hemp-drester, who has the

Johnson's Dictionary,

profit of their labour, an apartment in the Prison, and a salary of ^14. I generally found them at work: they are provided for, so as to be able to perform it. The hours of work are in winter from eight to four; in summer from fix to fix, deducing meal-times. The Steward is allowed eight-pence a day for the maintenance of each Prisoner; and contracts to supply them as follows — On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, a penny loaf, ten ounces of drefied beef without bone, broth, and three pints of ten shilling beer: on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, a penny loaf, four ounces ot cheese or some butter, a pint of milk-pottage, and three pints ot ten shilling beer.

The Porter or Keeper is John Brown. Salary ^80; no Fees. To the women's ward there is a Matron, Sarah Lyon, Salary £ho. She takes care of the sick, both men and women; and is allowed a shilling a day for those that are put on the sick diet.

In Bridewell is a Public Chapel: the Prisoners go thither on Sunday morning (except such as are, in a manner, destitute of apparel): the men and women separated from each other, and from the rest of the congregation.

On the walls of the Hall and Court-room are hung up many Tables of very considerable Gifts and Legacies to this Hospital, in common with others: sufficient, one would think, to have made this Prison more commodious, by providing several work-rooms, and lodging-rooms, for keeping the Prisoners more separate.

In winter they have some firing. The night-rooms are supplied with straw. No other Prison in London has any straw or other bedding.

each you descend seven steps. In the Men's Court is a large open Hied, which is their day-room. The roof too low for the depth: it has a chimney. Their night-ward, into which they are not permitted to go in the day-time, that the air in it may be cool and fresh, is a house on the other side of the yard, divided into two parts. Each part has a room on the ground-floor, a chamber, and an upper room. , T.n one part each of these rooms is thirty feet by thirty-one: in the other part, thirty' by twenty: near ten feet high: well planked all over: no chimneys. For the purpose of transmitting air, every room has in front, to the yard, two windows; and backwards three, with iron bars, and shutters; but, very' properly', no glass. Barrack-beds in every' room; but in each of the two chambers and in one of the lower rooms are other beds for those who pay three shillings and six-pence a week: when these beds are occupied, no Prisoners sleep on the barrack-beds in those rooms. In this Court is a lock-up room for the unruly. All the stairs are Hone.

On one side of the Women's Court is their day-room; with a fire-place. Their night-rooms are — one on the ground-floor ranging with the day-room, and called the Lozv Ward; twenty-one feet by seventeen, and ten feet high — a chamber over it of the fame size — and a passage or gallery over the day-room: on the back of it are five cabins or cupboards, each ten feet by five feet eight inches, with a barrack-bed for two prisoners. These clolets will be very' unwholesome; having no air but from grates over the doors into the gallery. The two larger night-rooms have windows only in front.

and Women's Ward are (as they Should be) too- high for them to look out.

The ground-floors, and the Men's Court-yard, are paved. The Women's, they told me, is to be paved also.

There is a Pump in each Court; and the New-River water is laid in: but not directly from the Main-, and constantly on, as it is at the neighbouring Prison.

A chapel, almost finished; which is to be common to this Prison and the Bridewell. Men of the two different prisons to be on opposite Aides below; and women in opposite galleries. There is a room above ic which lowers the ceiling. This circumstance, and the chapel not being large, will endanger its being offensive.

The Tap-Room is near the outer gate. Prisoners do not come into it; but take their liquor at a wicket made for that purpose in the wall, that separates if from them. No infirmary: no bedding or draw.

A matron has £5 salary out of the Gaoler's £30. In July 1775 the Justices thought fit to raise his fees from 5 s. 6d. to 7 s.

A generous Benefactor (a falefman in Smithfield) often lends the Prisoners Ijeef and bread. They have occalionally other small donations.

In the gate-way is a board on which is painted as follows.

HIS is a Prison for the Liberty and Manor of Stepney; and Remarks.

Hackney. The former ineludes, by a printed Lift which I have, towns, parishes, villages, streets, lanes, &c. to the number of forty-six > and was granted by King Edward VI. to Lord Wentworth, and his Heirs for ever.

In it are confined those whole debts are above £2, and under £5. The Master's-side Prisoners have four sizeable chambers, fronting the road 5 i. e. two on each story. They pay two shillings and six-pence a week; and lie two in a bed; two beds in a room. The Common-side Debtors are in two long rooms in the Court-yard, near the Tap-room. Men in one room, women in the other: the Courtyard in common. They hang out a begging-box from a little closet in the front of the House; and attend it in turn. It brings them only a few pence a day: and of this pittance none partake but those who at Entrance have paid the Keeper two shillings and six-pence; and treated the Prisoners with half a gallon of beer. The last rime I was there no more than three had purchased this privilege.

The Prison is out of repair. The Keeper, George Garred, is an Officer: he pays Rent £20 to the Lady of the Manor; and keeps the Tap: Window-tax above £3. Fees £0: 8: 1. No Table: but in November last I saw a paper hung up, on which was written as follows:

At the same time I saw another paper intitled Rules and Orders to be observed in this Prison. It is dated Aug. 6. 1776. The first Rule is “ That every person who comes into this Prison as a Prisoner, shall pay for his Garnish two shillings and ten-pence halfpenny.”

The Clauses of the Act against Spirituous Liquors are hung up.

At my first visit there were on the Common-side two Prisoners in hammocks, sick and very poor. — No Chaplain. A compassionate Man, who is not a regular Clergyman, sometimes preaches to them on Sunday; and gives them some small relief.

Lady Townsend fends a Guinea twice a year, which her Servant distributes equally among the Prisoners.

As Debtors here are generally very poor, I was surprized to fee once ten or twelve noisy men at (kittles; but the Turnkey said they were only visitants. I found they were admitted here as at another public house. No Prisoners were at play with them.

THE SAVOY.

THIS Prison for Soldiers, has two rooms called the Guard Rooms-, because in them are confined Offenders who are of the King's Guards. The remainder of the building near the gate is the Keeper's House. On the opposite side of the yard, is a large room down five steps, the Hall: the rooms over it useless. On the left-hand side of the £ard is another hall, not so large: at each end of it is a room with barrack bedsteads and beds; both rooms very close and unhealthy. Over them are other barrack-rooms, somewhat more airy: one of them. No. 4, is tolerable, and has opposite windows. There is, besides, the Black Hole, the Condemn'd Hold, the Cock Pit, and several other parts of this irregular building, which I pass over.

March 15, 1776, there were 119 Prisoners; of whom 49 were Transports. I saw many sick and dying. The Gaol was so infected by them, that the Distemper has been caught there by many since: and if it be not thoroughly purified, it will destroy many more. — The whole is indeed much out of repair hardly any part of it secure.

The women should have another day-room: and one of the day-rooms for men should be enlarged. There would then be less quarreling among them: and Prisoners who are now idle might be employed. The Court-yards adjacent might also be enlarged. All the rooms for women and their court-yard, and the men's night-rooms would be more airy if the Garden Pales were set farther off. I know Mr. Smith would with pleasure fee part of his Garden sacrificed to these Improvements. He pays Window-tax £z: 4: o, and Water £1.

WESTMINSTER GATE-HOUSE.

HIS Prison, the property of the Dean and Chapter, is over Remarks

two gate-ways. It has three floors, five rooms on each; in which have been sometimes near a hundred Prisoners: but it is

now so ruinous, that none are sent to it. All are committed to Tothill-fields Bridewell, which, in consequence, is overcrowded; and besides (as was there noted) Debtors, even from the Court of Conscience, are confined at night, (as well as in the day-time) with Criminals: which is contrary to the statute of 22d and 23d Car. II.

I have from the very old Keeper the particulars of Rent, Fees &c. but as the Prison is now useless, I will not transcribe them.

floors of chambers; four rooms on each floor; near ten feet square, and seven high. On the left hand side of the street is the Chapel; and fix houses for Prisoners; of equal depth with the former houses: but the back-rooms have not, as the former have, communication with the fore-rooms. At the hither end of the fore-rooms, on the ground-floor, is a common Kitchen, much too small. The Cook, a Prisoner, has the room over it. These houses also have ground-rooms, and two floors of chambers. AH the rooms fronting King-street, and the whole of the houses on the other side the way, are for Master-side Debtors; who pay for each room unfurniflted a flnlling a week.

The back part of the left hand Row is the Common-side r the-doors in the back front. The fir A: room on the ground-floor they call their Court-room. The twc houses at the farther end have fix rooms each, for Crown-Debtors and Fines; and are called Crown-Court. The rest of this range on all the three floors is for Common-side Debtors.

At the farther end of King-street, in a small Court inclosed from the rest of the yard, is a building called the State-house; consisting of ground-floors, and two floors of chambers; four sizeable rooms on each floor; total twelve. A Debtor w'ho chooses to be here, pays the Marshal eight to ten guineas for his whole time; besides a shilling a week, like other Master-side Debtors.

All these old buildings are out of repair.

The New Buildings are — First, a house at the gate for the Turnkey. The chambers are very convenient; and let at present to a Prisoner who pays a very high rent. — But the principal new building is at the farther end of the yard. The two parts of it form a right.

angle. One part is four houses, with four ground rooms to each; and the fame number of chambers on each of the three floors above: total sixty-four. The rooms are about thirteen feet by eleven, and about eight feet high. The other part, (the wing) is built as the Fleet Prison; but more airy and commodious. It has the fame number of floors as the other part. On each floor is a passage seven feet and a half wide, and seventy-three and a half long: rooms on each side the passage, eleven on each floor, total forty-four j each room thirteen feet and a half by nine and a half, about eight feet high.

The Prison is well supplied with water. Among the late improvements, of 108 new rooms, and a spacious yard, it is pity they did not build an Infirmary. The Prisoners are numerous. At more than one of my visits (which I repeated to this as well as many other Prisons much oftener than the times when I took the numbers) some had the Small-Pox. It was so crowded this last summer, that a Prisoner paid five shillings a week for half a bed, and many lay in the Chapel. In May 1776 the number of Prisoners within the walls was 395; and by an accurate lift which I procured, their wives (including a few only called so) were 279, children 725, total 1004: about two thirds of these were in the Prison.

This Prison is visited at Michaelmass term, as the Act* dirests; yet at my first visit there was a Wine-Club, and a Beer-Club; and one can scarcely ever enter the walls without seeing parties at skittles, missisippi, portobello, tennis, fives &c.

The following Tables of Rules cud Orders for the government of this Prison are hung up (as required by the Preamble) for common inspection. I presume to give an abridgment of them.

hold for the time being. The great abuses practised by this Officer were reported to Parliament by the Gaol Committee in 1729.

This Prison is an old irregular building (rather several buildings) in a spacious yard. There are, in the whole, near sixty rooms; and yet only fix of them now left for Common-side Debtors. Of the other rooms,

. — Five are let to a man who is not a prisoner: in one of them he keeps a chandler's shop; in two he lives with his family: the other two he lets to Prisoners. Four rooms, the Oaks, are for women. They are too few for the number; and the more modest women complain of the bad company, in which they are confined. There -arc above forty rooms for men on the Master's-side, in which are about sixty beds; yet many Prisoners have no beds nor any place to fieep in but the Chapel, and the Tap-room.

The Prison is too final 1 and greatly out of repair. Little regard is shewn to the late Act for white-walking and cleaning the rooms. No Infirmary. The yard is well supplied with water. In it the Prisoners play at rackets, mifiifippi &c; and in a little back court, the Park, at skittles.

The Tap is let to a Prisoner in the Rules of the King's Bench Prison: this Prison being just within those Rules. I was credibly informed, that one sunday in the summer 1775, about 600 pots of beer were brought in from a public house in the neighbourhood, (Ashmcre s) the Prisoners not then liking the Tapper's beer.

Ix March 1775, when the number of Prisoners was 175; there were with them in this incommodious Prison wives and children 46.

Mr. Allxutt who was many years since a prisoner here; had, during his confinement, a large estate bequeathed to him. He learn-

v

eel sympathy by his bufferings: and left £ 100 a year to release poor Debtors from hence. Many are cleared by it every year.

CHELMSFORD.

A CLOSE Prison, frequently infefted with the Gaol-Distemper. Inquiring in October 1775, for the Head-Turnkey, I was told he died of it.

In the Tap-room there hung a Paper on which, among other things, was written c< Prisoners to pay Garnish or run the Gauntlet.”

Debtors have a bushel of coals a day from about 12th November to Lady Day: and 7^5: 0: 0a year by a legacy of Elizabeth Her-ris from Lands in Brentwood, paid by the Rebtor or Minister of the parish of Chelmsford on the 24th of December. By a Memorial hung up in the Tap-room it appears the Bequest was acknowledged by the Testatrix 14th June 1746. — It was generous in the Justices to grant Debtors the fame allowance as Felons; and very judicious to fix that allowance to a certain weight.

It gave me pain to be informed, that there had been no Divine Service for above a year past, except to condemned Criminals.

There is a new Gaol, which exceeds the old one in strength &rc. almost as much as in splendor. The County, to their honour, have spared no cost. The Magistrates cannot but know the plan. The Prison is nearly finished. It can therefore be of no service to offer any remarks upon this Jlately fabrick.

MAIDSTONE.

THE Rooms in the Felons Wards are sizeable; but the air is obstructed by broad wooden bars at the windows instead of iron ones. There are three court-yards: one for Debtors; one for Men-felons; and one for Women-felons. The two last are much too small; but may be commodiously enlarged, by adding to them the adjacent court of the Old Bridewell, which will soon be disused. Then also a Chapel might be built; and service no longer performed, as it now is, upon the Fairs.

Felons are allowed yearly ten chaldron of coals: they have barrack-beds *, and hop-bagging withdraw; but no coverlids. This County has for years past been so considerate as to pay the Fees of poor Prisoners acquitted i and to Transports cast at Afllzes, who are entitled to the King's allowance of two shillings and six-pence a week, they continue the allowance which they had before trial. They also pay the Gaoler's Fees for those Convicts. The Felons said they wished for more bread; and would, if that were increased, be content with less beer.

The Baker "who serves the Felons fells thirteen loaves to the dozen; and Debtors have amongst them every thirteenth loaf.

There is an Alarm-Bell; and a Sail-Ventilator.

On examining two sick Prisoners, I found they had no irons; and the Surgeon said the Gaoler was always ready to take them off when, he requested it.

These are low stages of board's; raised from the floor, and Hoping from the-wall towards the middle of the room,

THE NEW GAOL, besides the Gaoler's House, and the Tap-room has for — Mailer's-side Debtors a parlour, and four other sizeable rooms; and for Common-side Debtors, four good rooms. Mr. Hall takes care to prevent these being crowded with the wives and children of the Debtors. For these Prisoners, there is a court-yard: into which Felons are not admitted; except a few, whom the Gaoler has reasons for indulging with that distinction.

The ward for Men-felons has fix rooms on three floors: in these they sleep. There is a yard belonging to it. — The ward for Women-felons has two lower rooms, two above; and a court-yard belonging to it. In the two upper rooms, are put Malefactors of either sex condemned to die.

I have here noted nineteen rooms: yet they are not sufficient for the number of Prisoners. Mr. Hall is sometimes obliged to put Men-felons into some rooms of the Women's ward.

In so close a Prison situated in a populous neighbourhood, I did not wonder to fee in March 1776 several Felons sick on the floors. No bedding nor straw: no Infirmary: no Chapel: Divine Service is performed in the Parlour; which is too small for the purpose; about sixteen feet square. The Act for preserving the health of Prisoners is on a painted board. The Clauses of the Act against Spirituous Liquors are hung up.

If the County do not build a new Gaol, more roomy and airy, and in a better situation, it would at least: be adviseable to add to

Transports have not the King's allowance of two shillings and six-pence a week. For these Convifls a Merchant contracts with the County to take them at the Gaol: the Gaoler fends them to the ship, attended by his servants; and receives from the Merchant so: io: 6 for each Prisoner so conducted.

Lent Assize is at Kingston: Summer Assize at Guildford and Croydon alternately. At this last town there is no Prison.

There is hung up in the Gaol a printed Lift of sixteen Legacies and Donations. The dates of the first fix are 1555, --7 t, — 76, — 84, — 97, — 98. Three are in the next century, viz. 1609, — 38, — 56. The other seven are not dated: and one of them noted on the Lift, has not been received since 1726. There are also other articles which seem to need inspection. Two of the Charities are for Debtors expressly: the others are not so distinguished; but Debtors have them all. In the title of the paper it is said, “ The Gaol was formerly called the White Lion Prison.'” The common Seal of the Prison is a Lion rampant.

There is another Legacy bequeathed by Eleanor Gwynn, not, 1 think, in the Lift; from which are sent to this Prison once in eight weeks, sixty-four penny loaves. Common-side Debtors have this as well as the preceding Gifts.

GUILDFORD BRIDEWELL has four rooms, besides the Infirmary (lately a liable), and the condemned room. Yet when the Assize is held here, and Prisoners are brought from Southwark, it is much crowded. A court-yard, for the use of which every Prisoner pays Entrance-money one shilling. No fewer. Two rooms have in the roof an iron-grated lattice, about five feet by four, and an open turret above; very useful for freshening those rooms. Allowance a threepenny loaf every other day (weight Feb. 1776, two pounds). No bedding nor llraw. — I did not fee any at work. — Keeper's Salary £25: Fees £o: 3: 4*. no Table. The Clauses of the Act against Spirituous Liquors are hung up.

Clauses of the Act against Spirituous Liquors are not hung up. When I was Sheriff, I was culpably ignorant of that Act. No Infirmary. About twenty years ago the Gaol-Fever was in this Prison: some died there, and many in the town; among whom was Mr. Daniel the Surgeon, who attended the Prisoners. His Successor, Mr. Gadfly, judiciously changed the medicines from Sudorifics (generally used before) to Bark and Cordials: and a Sail-Ventilator being soon after put up, the Gaol has been free from the Fever almost ever since.

FEES on a printed paper, signed by the late Gaoler, as follows:

ALL Persons that come to this place, either by warrant, commitment, or verbally; mutt pay before discharg'd, fifteen shillings and four pence, to the Gaoler, and two shillings to the Turnkey.

That part which is called the Upper Gaol has ten rooms for Master's-side Debtors; and Leads for them to walk on. — The Low Gaol has several rooms for Debtors, Felons &c. — A small area in the middle of the Gaol, in which are lately made some improvements j such as a pump, a convenient bath, and some rooms over it. There is a dungeon down a ladder of eight steps, for Men-felons; in which is often an inch or two of water: and a small room for Women-felons; which keeps them always separate from the men, except when delicacy would most of all require it. There are two airy rooms for the sick: so distinct from the rest of the Prison, that there is no danger of spreading any infection from thence. The Gaoler is humane, and respected by his Prisoners. These, Felons as well as Debtors, fell at the grates of their separate day-rooms, laces, purses, nets &c. of their own making.

At Lent Afilze Prisoners are moved from hence to d'hctford; and put into a dungeon which is described in that place.

Remarks. THIS is also the town gaol: yet only one court-yard. — For Debtors, a kitchen, or day-room j and several chambers: one of these is lately made a free ward. — For Felons a day-room: and for the men a strong night-room j with beds excellently contrived for cleanliness and health. Each Prisoner has a crib-bedstead, ten or twelve inches high; the head raised a few inches j strong feet, low Tides. These keep as distinfl as possible Prisoners who deep in the fame room j and are easily moved when the ward is to be washed. The County allows to each crib a straw bed, and a blanket. — The women have no separate day-room: and their v/ard, or night-room, has no fire-place. — One of the two drinking-rooms is called the Garnish-room. — Two rooms for the sick; not distinct enough from the rest. It is not without reluctance that I add, the sick in February 1776 complained to me of being neglected by the Surgeon. At my last visit, none sick. — Debtors fell at the front grate garters, purses &c. of their own making.

A neat Chapel lately built. Mr. Brome, the Chaplain, does not content himself with the regular and punctual performance of his stated Duty; He is a Friend to the Prisoners on all occasions.

Assize always at Bury: no allowance for conveying Prisoners thither. Keeper a Sheriff's Officer.

Debtors have on Sunday from a Legacy of Mr. John Pemberton, each one pound and a half of beef for broth, a penny loaf and a pint of ale. From another Legacy the Town supplies them with five chaldron of coals yearly. No Memorial in the Gaol.

BURY St. EDMUND'S GAOL.

This Prison for the Franchise or Liberty of Bury St. Edmund's, is the property of Sir Charles Davers. The court-yard is spacious, but not secure: none have the use of it without paying a shilling a week. On one side of it are several rooms for Debtors: one of them is a work-room: those who work in it pay a shilling a week. — On the other side, is a large Dungeon down three steps; which is the day and night-room for Felons: the men are chained to staples fixed in the barrack bedsteads. No straw. There is another dungeon down a step or two; seldom used. The late Gaoler told me that in the winter 1773 five died of the Small-Pox. No Apothecary then; but one is appointed since. No Infirmary. — A Chaplain; and Prayers twice a week. — Keeper, no Salary: Fees, Debtors £0: 8: 8, Felons ,£0: 6: 8: no Table: Licence for Beer and Wine. — Allowance, Debtors none. Felons three-halfpennyworth of bread a day; and from the 5th of November to the Saturday before Lady-day, Felons have two bushels of coals a week, and Debtors four: both from a Legacy of which no Memorial in the Gaol. — In a Description of Bury printed 1771, there is an account of several ancient Donations and Bequests to Prisoners. Whether they be now totally sunk, or the coals be from some of them, I cannot say.

WARWICK.

Remarks. ONE Court-yard for Debtors, and Men-felons. Women-felons have quite separate Court, day-room, and two night-rooms. They used to be loaded with irons; now they have none. Men-felons have a day-room: their night-room is in an octagonal Dungeon about twenty-one feet diameter, down thirty-one steps; close, damp, and offensive. Two cells, in another dungeon for the condemned. Prisoners are tried in the county cloathing. I saw twelve suits for men and fix for women.

Debtors common day-room is the Hall, which is also used as a Chapel. For Master's-side, ten or twelve rooms, some of them in the Rooks Nefi, where also is the free ward.

No Infirmary. The late Gaoler Mr. Roe (uncle to the present) died in 1772 of the Gaol-Distemper; and so did some of his Prisoners. No water then, but now plenty. — The Felons allowance of bread is judiciously fixed by weight, not variable with the price.

Debtors have in common from a Legacy thirty shillings a year: and from another Legacy eight three-penny loaves at the beginning, and as many at the end, of every month. No memorial of either Legacy hung up in the Gaol.

This Prison might be improved on the adjacent ground belonging to the county.

window: — above is a free ward for Court of Conscience Debtors, who are cleared in forty days: this is a sizeable room, but has only one window eighteen inches square. Over it is another room, or two.

In this small court-yard, besides the litter from the liable, I saw a stagnant puddle near the fink, for the Gaoler's ducks. Gaoler's poultry is a very common nuisance; but in so scanty a court it is intolerable. — The whole Prison is very offensive. — At some particular times here are great numbers confined. Once in the winter 1775 there were above 150, who by the care of the Magistrates had a supply of proper food, broth &c. — Licence for Beer: Fees £0: 2: 0: no Table.

FOR Master's-side Debtors eight or nine rooms. Day-room common. The free ward the Cellar is a long dungeon*, which is down seven steps and damp; two windows; the largest about a foot square. Felons day and night rooms are dungeons from five to seven steps under ground. They sleep on thick mats; which, if coverlids were added, would be better than straw. The whole close and offensive. Court-yard small. No Chapel. Two rooms lately built for an Infirmary: but the situation of the Gaol is so confined, that it cannot be made convenient or healthy. In 1774 three Debtors and a Felon died of the Small-Pox. Of that disease I was informed few ever recover in this Gaol.

Clauses of the Act against the use of Spirituous Liquors painted on the fame board as the Table of Fees.

In this County they make an annual collection by a kind of Voluntary Brief. The Gentlemen of the Grand-Jury recommend it to the Clergy: most of whom promote the collection in their respective parishes. The thanks of the Grand Jury to forty-eight Clergymen by name, were inserted in the Leicester Journal of Feb. 16th 1775 j for the satisfaction of those Gentlemen and other Contributors. There is a table of the sum received from each parish; and a List of Debtors

This seems to be the low moist Dungeon that was complained of by a debtor in this Gaol, in his Letter 13th Nov. 1690 sent to Moses Pitt, a Prisoner in the Fleet; who printed it, with other Letters from Prisoners, in his Cry of the Oppressed 1691. Ily this and one or two more of the Letters in that little Tract, it appears that some inconveniences which I observed in Gaols, and have set down in my Remarks, are of long Handing.

The accounts are kept, and the application of the money is chiefly directed by John Simpson, Esq. of Leicester. I wish every County would imitate this exemplary benevolence: and I wish every County that does so, a Steward equally faithful and assiduous.

[Remarks.]

THIS GAOL, built about eighteen years ago, is in an airy healthy situation. — The Debtors Court-yard and Ward very properly separate from those for Felons, but not from the Bridewell. The Debtors floors are tarras, not easily washed. The windows in general too small. — The Bridewell, in the Debtors court, has a large workroom, a lodging-room for men, and two for women. Mr. Simpson is Keeper: Salary £40, deducing £14 for the former Keeper. — In the Felons Court there is for men a day-room, and down three steps a dungeon: for women a day-room, and two small night-rooms; the latter are too close. — A neat Chapel, and near it a new Bath: Prisoners wash in it before Assize and Quarter Sessions: a Copper just by to warm the water in winter. — Over those are two rooms for an Infirmary. — There is also a new room or parlour at the Keeper's house with windows to the Felons court: this circumstance keeps them quiet and orderly. The County allows eight guineas a year for Straw.

Mr. Simpson observed to me very judiciously, that “Licences in Gaols occasion much disorder.”

A person goes round the County about Christmas to Gentlemen's houses, and begs for the Debtors. He carries a book, in which the Giver enters his name, and donation. The whole amount generally about £14.

CHESTERFIELD GAOL,

For the Hundred of Scarsdale, is the property of the Duke of Portland; to whom, or to his Steward, the Gaoler pays £18 : 12 : 0 a year. — Only one room with a cellar under it; to which the Prisoners occasionally descend through a hole in the floor. The cellar had not been cleaned for many months. The Prison-door had not been opened for several weeks, when I was there first. There were four Prisoners, who told me they were almost starved: one of them said, with tears in his eyes, “he had not eaten a morsel that day;” it was afternoon. Their meagre sickly countenances confirmed what they said. They had borrowed a book of Dr. Manton's; one of them was reading it to the rest. Each of them had a wife; and they had in the whole thirteen children, cast on their respective parishes. Two had their groats from the Creditors; and out of that pittance they relieved the other two. No allowance: no straw: no firing: water a halfpenny for about three gallons, put in (as other things are) at the window. — Gaoler lives distant.

NOTTINGHAM.

[Remarks.]

THE GAOL is on the side of a hill. For Master's side Debtors three rooms. Down about twenty-five steps, are three rooms for Criminals who can pay. Down twelve steps more are deep dungeons, cut in the sandy rock, very damp: only one of them is used; it is twenty-one feet by thirteen, and seven feet high: the straw on barrack-beds.

For Bathing here is (not, as in most other County Gaols, an inconvenient and almost useless Tub — but) a large and very commodious Bath, supplied with river water; and a Copper just by, to warm it when necessary. This Bath is a late improvement; and so is the Infirmary, near it, which has two rooms. The Act for preserving the Health of Prisoners is neatly painted over the Keeper's door.

The Justices have allowed the Gaoler to supply the sick with better nourishment &c. to the amount of seven shillings a week. Gentlemen so remarkably considerate and humane will, I hope, abolish the unwholesome Dungeon.

No Chapel. Service is performed in a parlour, which is too small.

Transports condemned at Assizes have, with the King's allowance of two shillings and six-pence a week, the County-bread.

Here (as at Derby) a man goes round the County about Christmas, and begs at Gentlemen's houses for the Debtors. He carries a book, and Gentlemen write in it their names and donations. Amount, the two last years £62. Charge of collecting £18.

Midland Circuit. NOTTINGHAMSHIRE. 289

Prisoners are tried in cloaths provided for that purpose by the County.

In the account lately sent up to London of Transports in this Gaol, was one William Berks. This man obtained his Majesty's pardon. Mr. Francis Waters, Clerk of Assize, in his letter sent with the pardon, charges

LINCOLN CASTLE

^BELONGS to the Duchy of Lo.ncaster. The County pays ten shillings a year. The Gaoler, per contract, to keep it in repair. — A spacious Area of six or seven acres. On the ground-floor are the Gaoler's apartments, the Tap-room &c.

For Master's-side Debtors, fix sizeable rooms on the first story; and as many garrets. The floors of both stories are tarras, and cannot be kept clean: the passages only fix feet wide, with windows close glazed.

The free ward for Debtors is only a room at the end of the building, down two steps. It is paved with small Hones, and is a thoroughfare to sundry places. First, by a trap-door in the said pavement you go down ten Heps to two vaulted dungeons for Criminals, eight feet high; one, the Pit, fourteen feet by twenty-one, window two feet by fourteen inches; the other, within it, the Condemned Cell, fourteen feet by eight; window about nine inches by eighteen: a little short straw on the floors: both dungeons dirty and offensive. — You also pass through it to the Women-felons ward which joins to it and is eleven feet by eight: — and to the Felons small court-yard, and their sizeable day-room, fifteen feet by nineteen: no water: no fewer: — and to a room for the clol'er confinement of Debtors who do not behave well.

There are two rooms with beds for Felons who can pay for them. To these you go another way.

No Chapel: Service is performed in the Shire-Hall. No Infirmary. — The whole Prison is out of repair. — Perhaps because the County designs to build a new one.

A separate night-room for women. — The Turnkey has now a lodging-room, over the Felons dungeon, with an alarm bell: so that an escape will be more difficult. There is lately fitted up a small room for an Infirmary; and another room or two: but no provision made for separating Men-felons at night; nor for Common-side Debtors. There is a room used for the Gaoler's poultry. — Transports have not the King's allowance of two shillings and six-pence a week. No Tabic of Fees.

About six years ago a Gentleman sent to this Gaol for the s thirty-six rugs or coverlids: moil of them now worn out.

When Felons come to this Prison, they are stripped and wallied; and then they put on cloaths provided by the County. The men have a Russia-drab coat and breeches, a flannel waistcoat, two check shirts, and two pair of yarn hose. The women, a linfey woolfey gown and petticoat, a flannel petticoat, two dowlafs fiiifts, two pair of yarn hose. Their own cloaths are ticketed and hung up till the Quarter Sessions or Assizes; when they put them on again to appear in on trial. Afterwards the County-cloaths are wallied, mended, and purified in an oven, for the use of future Criminals. The cloathing aforesaid for twenty men and five women cost only £26: 6: 8.

The following Verses arc written over the Debtor's grate to the street:

OXFORD CASTLE.

Remarks. FOR the Castle Gaol the County pays £40 a year to Mr. Ettj, who holds it of Christ Church College on Lease. — Debtors apartments small; and not enough of them for the general number of Prisoners. No free ward: for lodging even in the Tower on their own beds they must pay is. 6d. a week: Jee the'Table. Their court-yard is too small. — Felons day-room for men and women down five steps: the men's dungeon down five more; only a small window: the women's night-room very small; no window. The court-yard common to both; much too small. The Gaoler has a spacious garden.

This Prison is also the City Gaol: for which Mr. Wisdom has ^5 a year. — In 1773 eleven died of the Small-Pox. In 1774 that distemper still in the Gaol: in 1775 one Debtor died of it in May; three Debtors and a Petty Offender in June: three recovered. No Infirmary: no straw.

Thomas Horde, who was confined here for some offence against Government, built the Chapel. After his discharge, he had bequeathed £14 a year for a Chaplain; and as much to the Prisoners. But finding some difficulties would obstruct the execution of that Bequest; he altered it, August 6th, 1709, to a Legacy of £24 a year to be distributed among Prisoners of both forts, at £2 a month. For the Payment, he bound an Estate in Oxfordshire: and to makeup any deficiency of that Estate, he bound an Estate in Berkjfsire. Yet the Prisoners have now only thirty-three shillings a month. A Memorial of the process and result of Mr. Horde's benevolent intention hangs up in the Gaol. I have a copy of it; too long to transcribe.

There

There is another Legacy to Prisoners of both forts; 8 s. 8d. a year; paid quarterly by Mr. Hart of Oxford.

Debtors have in common every Saturday two shillings worth of meat; sent by a Gentleman of Christ Church College. From two other Colleges they have in bread about as. 4d. a week. Christ Church and New College fend them broth; generally three times in a fortnight: the Prisoners pay four pence to the man who brings it.

Mr. Wisdom (the Gaoler) told me that about nine years ago, wanting to build a little hovel, and digging up stones for the purpose, from the ruins of the Court, which was formerly in the Castle, he found under them a complete skeleton with light chains on the legs; the links very small. These were, probably, the bones of a Malefactor who died in Court of the Distemper at the Black Assize mentioned page 17.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

THAME. I was informed that this House, built in 1708, was given to the County for a Bridewell: but the greatest part of it is now a Pariili Work-house. For the Prison there is only left, up stairs, a common day-room, and a small insecure lodging-room: and down eleven steps a dungeon in which are two night-rooms, the Cubs, each nine feet by seven. — If the Ploufe was put into good repair, and the whole used as a. Bridewell, it would be a commodious one. Then there would be no need offending Petty Offenders, as is now done, to the County Gaol: nor of locking up all day long within doors those few that are committed hither, men and women in the fame room: nor of confining either sex at night in the Cubs. No allowance: no employment: no water: no sewers. Keeper's Salary £\6: Fees 4s. 6d. no Table.

The Keeper now farms the Work-hotrfe and the reff of the poor at ^480 a year for the whole maintenance, cloathing, medicines &c.

I saw a crowd of men talking at the grate with the Prisoners, who were all of them women; and was informed there is sometimes riot and confusion on such occasions.

WORCESTER.

Remarks. THE CASTLE-YARD is spacious: County Members arc chosen in it. In the Gaoler's house are many good lodging-rooms for Master's-side Debtors; and two small day-rooms; one of these is used as a Chapel. — The free ward, or night-room for Debtors, is at another part of the yard. You go to it through the Women-felons night-room. The day-room for Men and Women-felons is in the middle of the area; only fourteen feet by twelve. Near it is a Hand-Ventilator for airing the Men-felons dungeon, which is twenty-six steps under ground, and circular, about seventeen feet diameter, with barrack-bedsteads. Over it is an aperture in the yard, with an iron grate. The Felons work the Ventilator cheerfully about a quarter of an hour before they go down, and as long when they come up; for it freshens and cools the dungeon amazingly: we could hardly keep our candle burning below while it was working. — Excellent water at a pump in the yard. Straw £4 a year. — No Infirmary. Mr. Hall-ward the Surgeon caught the Gaol-Fever some years ago, and has ever since been fearful of going into the dungeon: when any Felon is sick there, he orders him to be brought out. — The Gaoler pays near £4 Window-tax. — Clauses of Act against Spirituous Liquors not hung up.

This Prison rnay be made commodious by separate wards, yards &c. There is round it much ground belonging to the County.

THIS GAOL is much too small for the number of Prisoners: and so is the Felons Court-yard. The Dungeon where the Men-felons deep is about two feet lower than the passage. No flops, a (loping descent. It is too close. No Infirmary. An Alarm-bell. It is pity that the Stream just on the outside of the Walls is not within them. I was pleased to lee plenty of clean straw in the Dungeon; and found it was owing to the generous and exemplary practice of not farming it, but allowing the Gaoler to order it whenever wanted, and the County paying for it themselves.

SHREWSBURY.

SEPARATE Court-yards for Debtors and Felons; but the Rev*arks. latter have no water. For this reason, and because their day-room is in the Debtors Court, both Debtors and Felons are commonly together in that Court. — Commodious apartments for Master's-side Debtors: and a large free ward for the Common-side. — For Felons there are two night-dungeons down eleven steps: that for men was about four years ago made more airy by an additional window: and it is, or should be, now daily freshened by a Hand Ventilator which is in the room above. The women's dungeon might also be freshened by the fame. — The day-room for Felons is small: men and women together. — The County is now enclosing a Court-yard for the Women; and will probably build them a separate Day-room. They will no doubt provide Water in this Court; as they should also in that of the Men-felons.

An Infirmary should be added: for if the intended improvements will be some protection against the Gaol-Fever, which of late years has prevailed here more than once, they will not secure Prisoners against the Small-Pox and other diseases.

When the Apothecary finds that a sick Prisoner should have better diet, he orders the Gaoler to provide it, and signs his bill for the amount; which is readily allowed by the Justices at Quarter Sessions.

Of the twenty-four Felons in September last, fourteen were Convicts for Transportation. — The County allows Transports convicted at Quarter Sessions as much as those convicted at Assize have from the King's allowance, viz, 2 s. 6d. a week.

The Justices of this County, at the General Quarter Sessions nthjan. 1774, were so considerate and humane, as to prohibit the demanding from Prisoners at their entrance into this Gaol, or into the County Bridewell, any money for drink, by the name of Garnish, or any other Name: and to require that two or more fair copies of their said order should be hung up in the most public places of the Gaol, for the inspection of Debtors, as well as Felons; that the unfortunate might not afterwards be Imposed upon.

Too finall: only one day-room for men and women. Two night-rooms above for women. In one of them I saw a poor young creature too ill to come down stairs j she was languishing on the floor in a consumption. The night-room for men is a dungeon down ten steps. There is a finall court-yard with water. — By means of a door from this into one of the Gaol Court-yards, thele Prisoners have a privilege (which few in Bridewells enjoy) of attending Public Worship in the Chapel on Sunday.

Keeper's Salary £50. Fees at Discharge of a Felon, 8 s. of one guilty of a Misdemeanor, 6 s. 8 d. of a Vagrant, 3 s. 6d. as per Table in the Prison. — Allowance, bread as Felons in the Gaol. Little or no employment: Keeper has half the profit.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at HEREFORD,

On the Castle-green, is quite out of repair. Indeed it is not only ruinous but dangerous: a cross wall is parted a great way from the wall against which it abutted. In the day-room there was a large quantity of water from the roof. No fire-place: offensive sewers: no yard: no water: no Hated allowance: no employment. —

Keeper's Salary £10. He told me that a little before I came, a Prisoner died after three weeks confinement. Six Prisoners, whom I saw there at my first visit, complained of being almost fr.mished. They were sent hither from the Assize a few days before to hard labour (as the sentence usually runs) for six months. The Justices had ordered the Keeper to supply each of them daily with a.twopenny loaf: but he had neglected them. They broke out soon after.

Remarks. ONLY one Court-yard. The rooms for Debtors small. Felons night-room at top of the house, with only one little window. Be-fides the difficulty of going daily up and down in irons; when water is to be carried so high, and the staircase, like this, is narrow and inconvenient, a room is seldom clean and healthy. This cannot be so if it should be crowded. At my first visit in 1774 they had the Gaol-Fever, of which J. Daverel and several of his Prisoners, and some of their friends died. — No Infirmary: there is room to build one at the bottom of the yard. The Brewhouse is very fit for a Felons Day-room; which is much wanted.

After the mortality mentioned above, all the Prisoners were new cloathed by the Duke of Beaufort.

John Gabriel a Gardener near the town used to lend each Prisoner every Quarter-day a fix-penny loaf; and at his decease he bequeathed the fame Donation. Prisoners do at present receive it; but there is no Memorial of the Legacy hung up.

GLOUCESTER CASTLE

IS also one of the County Bridewells: yet only one Court-yard for all Prisoners; and one small Day-room, twelve feet by ten, for Men and Women-felons. The night-room (the Main) for Men-felons, though up many stone steps, is close and dark; and the floor is so ruinous, that it cannot be walked. Adjoining to the Main, there are other night-rooms for Fines See. men and women separate. Fines have also their separate day-room. Many Prisoners died here in 1773; and always, except in my last visit, I saw l'orne sick in this Gaol. The large Dunghill that one constantly fees near the stone steps may be one cause of it. — The whole Prison is much out of repair. Some alterations arc now making at the Gateway. I hope the Gentlemen will consider the dreadful condition of the other Buildings.

The upper rooms of the Castle were the Bridewell; but they are not now used except occasionally for a Prisoner that has the Small-Pox &c. there being no Infirmary.

Of the Felons &c. in September and December last, thirteen were Transports: most of them convicted at Lent Assize 1775. About twenty were Fines; who not having the County allowance, nor any employment, were in September very pitiable objects indeed; half naked, and almost famished. But in December their appearance was much altered. Mr. Raikes and other Gentlemen took pity on them, and generously contributed toward the feeding and cloathing the m. — Mr. Williams has £10 a year as Bridewell Keeper.

In this Gaol were some Prisoners, who had been arrested by Exchequer Writs j in which an Officer is commanded “ to bring

“ the

345

“ the body before the Barons of the Exchequer — at Westminster — “ to answer our Sovereign Lord the King concerning divers tref-Cf passes, contempts, and offences &c.” The Prisoners are called Contempts. In different parts of the Kingdom, there are many Prisoners detained by such Writs, which are indeed numerous.

Resiarks. THIS GAOL is kept-very clean; and the late alterations in it are improvements. The present Dungeon is down but five steps: it is boarded and has large windows. The former destructive Dungeon was darker, and down eleven steps: Mr. Lipscomb informed me that more than twenty Prisoners had died in it of the Gaol Fever in one year; and that his predecefi'or died of the fame distemper. The Felons day room is commodiously enlarged. Their straw beds and coverlids are brought out and aired when the weather is fine. They have every day a clean towel hung on a roller: the prisoner who takes care of it and delivers it next day is paid a penny. If a little court, which is now shut up from the Gaol, and totally useless, were cleared, lowered, and opened towards the Prison, it would be very conducive to health and convenience.

St. Cross's Hospital bread (the Dole) is about a penny loaf given to each of the Prisoners fix times a year: viz. on the eve of the following days, ioth August, 31st October, Christmas, Easter, 3d of May, and Whitsunday.

The College allowance to Felons is, once a week, an ox's head, four fiieeps heads and henges, about seventeen pints of oatmeal, three pints of salt, twelve loaves the size of twopenny ones, about twenty gallons of table beer, and generally three times a week the broken victuals. In Lent they have not the ox head, nor the other meat.

The Gaoler has two guineas a year for keeping a bread account, to check the baker. The Justices also take care of this matter; and, in consequence, the quarterly bills, now the Prisoners have three halfpence a day, amount to no more than they did in the last Gaoler's and Baker's time when the allowance was but a penny a day.

THE PRISON in this City called Fisherton-Anger Gaol (from the name of the Parish in which it Hands) near a fine stream, is also one of the county bridewells. Only one yard. No day-room for Common-side Debtors, nor Felons: each fort have their fire on a brick hearth raised in the middle of their respective lodging-rooms, without chimney. The Debtors room over the Felons. Women-felons have a separate room, more commodious.

Mr. Biggs has £6: 13: 4 Salary for the Bridewell; and £10 a year for Fees of Prisoners acquitted at Quarter Sessions. He pays Window-tax £3: 15: 0.

The lad time I was there, I saw a new building in the yard; a liable, £art-house, and brew-house; with an Infirmary over them; one room for men, another for women. I could not help wishing that the lower part indead of stable &c. had been two day-rooms with fire-places, one for Common-side Debtors, another for Felons.

That part of the Prison which was the Bridewell is not secure; and Petty Offenders are confined in the Gaol.

Just without the Prison-gate is a round staple fixed in the wall: through it is put a chain, at each end of which a Common-side Debtor padlocked by the leg. Hands offering to those who pass by, nets, laces, purses &c. made in the Prison. The two whom I saw there laH were Crown Debtors not cleared by the late Insolvent Act.

I have been informed, that at Christmas, Felons chained together were permitted to go about; one of them carrying a sack or bafleet for food, another a box for money.

Mr. Rule the Surgeon told me that he was by contrail excused from attending in the Dungeons any Prisoners that should have the Gaol-Fever.

There is no ‘Table of Fees. But by the close of the Preamble at the Sheriff's Ward, the Table there seems to have included originally the Fees of this Gaol also.

The Gaoler has for each Transport two guineas from the Merchant, to whom the County pays per contrail £5.

About Christmas, the Gaoler permits his Prisoners to solicit Charity in the City. When I was lad there the box was broke open, supposed by the person who conduiled them and absconded. If any Gentleman would undertake the disposal of the Contributions, this would not only prevent such a fraud, but the money laid out for meat, firing &c. would be far more beneficial than their spending most of it in liquor.

It was commendable and exemplary in the Justices of this County lo fix the Felons allowance by a certain weight of good bread, not variable with the price.

Remarks.

THIS GAOL, though built in a large yard belonging to the old ruinous Cattle, is very small; house and court measuring only fifty two feet by forty four; and the house not covering half that ground. The Prison is a room or passage twenty three feet and a half by seven and a half, with only one window two feet by one and a half: — and three Dungeons or Cages on the side opposite the window: these are about fix and half feet deep; one nine feet long; one about eight; one not five: this last for women. They are all very offensive. No chimney: no drains: no water: damp earth floors: no Infirmary. The yard not secure; and Prisoners seldom permitted to go out to it. Indeed the whole Prison is out of repair, and yet the Gaoler lives distant. I once found the Prisoners chained two or three together. Their provision is put down to them through a hole in the floor of the room above (used as a Chapel); and those who serve them there, often catch the fatal fever. At my first visit I found the Keeper, his Assistant, and all the Prisoners but one, sick of it: and heard that a few years before, many Prisoners had died of it; and the Keeper and his wife in one night.

I learned that a woman who was discharged just before my first visit (by the Grand Jury making a collection for her Fees) had been confined three years by the Ecclesiastical Court; and had three children in the Gaol. There is no Table of Fees.

The King, of his Royal Bounty, has offered two thousand pounds towards a new Gaol; but nothing is done by the County.

I was edified by the serious behaviour of the Chaplain at Prayers.

CORNWALL.

The Prisoners respect him, and were very attentive. He has a large family: I was sorry for the late reduction of his Salary.

The Mayor sends the Prisoners weekly one shilling's worth of bread: no memorial of the legacy in the Gaol. Transports have not the King's allowance of as. 6d. a week. Clauses of Act against Spirituous Liquors not hung up.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at BODMIN.

The County pays ^20 a year for this Prison. It is much out of repair; and the walls round the yard not safe enough to let Prisoners use it. The night rooms are two garrets, with small sky-lights seventeen inches by twelve, close glazed. I was informed that a few years ago the Gaol-Fever was very fatal, not only in the Prison, but also in the Town. Keeper's Salary lately raised from ^20 to £iS. Fees 16s. 8d. no Table. Allowance a three-penny loaf in two days; (weight, Dec. 1775, 31 oz.) No employment. A Surgeon to this Bridewell; his Salary £20.

The door had not been opened for four weeks when I went in i and then the Keeper began fhoveling away the dirt. — There was only one Debtor, who seemed to have been robust, but was grown pale by ten weeks close confinement, with little food, which he had from a brother, who is poor and has a family. He said, the damp-nefs of the Prison, with but little straw, had obliged him (he spoke with sorrow) to send for the bed on which some of his children lay.

THE GAOL is near the river, and has no offensive sewers. The apartments roomy j but the court-yards too little. They might be enlarged eafhvard. Men-felons have no day-room: a room, which is fit, and Teems to have been designed for that use, is taken by the Gaoler for a liable. Assizes never held here. Prisoners are moved for trial to the Bridewell at Taunton; or to Bridgewater where the Prison is only one room; or to JFells where there is no Prison at all: and yet, at Midsummer Assize 1775 the Prisoners were kept in that City eight days.

Every time I was here I saw one Thomas Hayes who was committed by order of the Ecclesiastical Court.

THIS NEWGATE (as that in the Metropolis) Hands in the inidft of the City. It is too small for the general number of s. P'or Debtors there are about fifteen rooms; yet no free ward. The poorest pay ten pence halfpenny a week: others two shillings and six-pence. — For Women-felons, a day-room and several night-rooms. — For Men-felons, a day-room, with a court-yard adjacent twenty feet by twelve. Their dungeon, the Tit, down eighteen Heps, is about eighteen feet by seventeen, and nine feet high: barrack-bedsteads: no bedding nor draw. It is close and offensive: only a small window. — There is another yard, the 'Tennis-Court, larger than that of the Felons: Prisoners are admitted into it by turns. — A room or two at the top of the house for an Infirmary. — There are many narrow passages: the utmost attention is requisite to keep the Prison healthy. I found it clean; considering it was so crowded and so close. It was lcraped and lime-whited once a year before the late Act for preserving the health of Prisoners. That Act is neatly painted on a board hung up in the Chapel, which is commodious and has a gallery: several Texts of Scripture are painted in lundry parts of it. — Clauses of the Act against Spirituous Liquors are not hung up. No Table of Gaoler's Fees.

The Rev. Mr. James Rouquet has been unwearied in attention to the spiritual and temporal interests of the Prisoners; officiating near twenty years without a Salary. He had only once a Gratuity of £~o*.

This was written before November 1776, when Mr. Rouquet died in the forty-seventh year of his age. The general Sorrow, and the Sermons preached and printed on that Occasion, do more than justify what I have said concerning the Zeal of this pious Divine.

YORK CASTLE.

IN THE SPACIOUS AREA is a noble Prison for Debtors, which Remarks. does honour to the County. You ascend by a fine flight of (tone steps to a floor on which are eleven rooms, full sixteen feet square, near twelve feet high. Above them is the fame number of rooms: one or two of these, for Common-side Debtors. The rooms are airy and healthy. On the ground-floor are the Gaoler's apartments &c.

The Felons court-yard is down five steps: it is too small, and has no water: the pump is just on the outside of the palisades. The day-room for men is only twenty-six feet by eight: in it are three cells: in another place nine cells: and three in another. The cells are in general about seven feet and a half by fix and a half, and eight and a half high; close and dark; having only either a hole over the door about four inches by eight, or some perforations in the door of about an inch diameter: not any of them to the open air, but into passages or entries. In most of these cells three Prisoners are locked up at night; in winter for fourteen to sixteen hours: straw on the -stone floors; no bedsteads. There are four condemned rooms about seven feet square. — A fewer in one of the passages often makes these parts of the Gaol very offensive: and I cannot say they are clean.

Indeed a clean Prison is scarcely ever seen, where the Water is to be brought in by the Gaoler's servants. The next house to the Castle-gate, and others in the neighbourhood, have river-water laid in at a moderate expense.

Women-felons are kept quite separate: they have two courtyards, but no water: you go down four steps to their two rooms, a day and a night room. Their condemned room is in another part of the Gaol: near it is a room to confine Debtors who do not behave well.

The Infirmary near the gate is only one middle-sized room. When Prisoners of one sex are there, those of the other are excluded. A sick man was kept out for that reason when I was there.

At Assize some Prisoners appear in Court on their trial in the Gounty-cloathing.*

The County pays one John Sherwood Jio a year to inspect and weigh the Bread, and deliver it to the Prisoners. He constantly attends for this purpose on Tuesday and Friday.

Transports convicted at Quarter Sessions have, besides the bread allowance, one shilling a week. Those call at Assize have the King's Allowance of zs. 6d. a week.

There is a grand Shire-Hall in the Castle yard almost finifiied. I hope the Gentlemen of this great County will not flop there; but proceed to build a proper Prison for Felons; in which Boys may be separated from Old Offenders, and the other Inconveniences of the present Gaol avoided.

Prison and Court-yard out of fight from the Keeper's house, though adjoining; and some Pril'oners have escaped. They are now let out to the court only half an hour in the day.

Remarks. THIS GAOL upon Ouse-Bridge, called the Kidcots, has on one side of the bridge four convenient chambers for Debtors, about eleven feet square: for these they pay six pence a week. Below them is a free ward with barrack-beds; and a room to the street. At the window they fell nets, purses, laces, &c.

The

The Men-felons Ward on the other side is down eleven Heps: that adjoining, for women, down ten. The two night rooms for Men are each fix feet and a half by five. The night room for Women about fix feet square. All the rooms for Felons, are close and offensive: no amendment since the late Act. The wooden door Hands open in the day time, to give them a little air. At the inner door, which is of iron grates, I have seen liquors handed to those who seemed to have had enough before. — No water, but when there is too much; that is, in a very high flood, then it flows into the rooms. — Gaoler a Sheriff's Officer for City and County.

It were in vain to offer any hints of improvement. This Gaol cannot be made a good one.

The Corporation pays free-ward Debtors one shilling and two pence three farthings a week by a Legacy of Mr. Peacock. No memorial of this in the Gaol. But there is a memorandum of another Legacy, viz. of Elizabeth Taylor, who by her Will dated 2 iff of October 1580 left 3s. 4d. to be divided equally among the Prisoners in Ouse- Bridge Gaol on Lady-day. This has not been received by them for some years.

BATLEY. Behind a House for the Keeper is the Prison, Plan rectangular: the Front is the wall and gate. On three fides are Lodging-rooms for Debtors; five or six about ten feet square; four much larger for two beds in each. Two Day-rooms; two work-rooms; and a dark room for the unruly. There are in a fieparate Court two rooms for Women-debtors: a provision veiy kind and prudent, and, I believe, peculiar to this Prison. — All the Prison rooms are on the ground floor.

In the old Prison at Rolhwell, I saw both times I was there, one William Carr a weaver: he had given a bad name to a woman who was said not to deserve a very good one: she cited him to the Ecclesiastical Court; and he was imprisoned 4th of May 1774.

THE HIGH GAOL is the Property of the Bishop. By Patent from his Lordsnip, Sir Hedworth Willtamjon Bart, is perpetual Sheriff. — The Court-yard for Master's-side Debtors is only twenty-four feet by ten. Common-side Debtors have none at all: their free wards, the Low Gaol, are two damp unhealthy rooms by the Gateway: they are never suffered to go out of these, unless to Chapel, which is the Master-side Debtors Hall; and not always to that: for on a Sunday when I was there and miffed them at Chapel, they told me they were not permitted to go thither. No sewers: at more than one of my visits, 1 learned that the dirt, ashes &c. had lain there many months. There is an excellent double-barreled Pump, which raises water about seventy feet.

Felons have no Court-yard: but they have a Day-room and two small rooms for an Infirmary. The Men are put at night into Dungeons: one seven feet square for three Prisoners: another, the Great Hole, has only a little window. In this I saw fix Prisoners, most of them Lranjports, chained to the floor. In that situation they had been many weeks; and were very sickly. Their draw on the Hone-floor almost worn to duff. Long confinement, and not having the King's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week, had urged them to attempt an Escape: after which the Gaoler chained them as above. — There is another dungeon middle-sized; and for Women-felons a separate room or two.

The Common-side Debtors, whom I saw eating boiled bread and water, told me, that this was the only nourishment some had lived upon for near a twelvemonth. They have from a Legacy two shillings a week in winter, and one shilling and six pence a week in summer

No memorandum of it in the Gaol: perhaps this may in time be loft; as the Gaoler laid two others were, viz. one of Billiop Crewe, and another of Billiop Wood,; from which Prisoners had received no benefit for some years past. The clauses of Act against Spirituous Liquors are hung up. Gaol-Delivery once a year.

There was a vacant piece of ground adjacent, of little use but for the Gaoler's occasional lumber. It extends to the river, and measures about twenty two yards by sixteen. I once and again advised the inclosing this for a Court-yard: but when I was there in January 1776 I had the mortification to hear that the Surgeon, who is Uncle to the Gaoler, had obtained from the Billiop in OAober preceding a Lease of it for twenty one‘years at the rent of one drilling fer annum. He had built a little liable on it.

and airy: I always found them remarkably clean, strewed with sand &c. The Corporation allow both Debtors and Felons firing and candles in plenty: and every Prisoner hath a chaff-bed, two blankets, and a coverlid: Debtors are not thus accommodated in any other Prison in England. They also allow brooms, mops, and all such necessaries. I copied the sums generously allowed for those articles; the whole amount is £45: 1: 4 per annum. This is one of the very-few Gaols that have what is called in London the rules. Part of two Streets near the Gaol is in the Prison-Liberty.

'There is no yard: but one might be made of the vacant ground that lies West of the Gaol. A Door should be cut in the wall between the Felons Ward and the room used for a Chapel. It would not then be necessary for them to come out and cross the street, as they do now.

The Debtors Beds are in Closets, which should be taken down. Instead of them Iron Bedsteads should be placed in the Wards, as in some Plospitals.

No Prisoners here have Fetters, unless they be riotous. For some years past, Prisoners acquitted have been discharged in Court. The Corporation paid tire Gaoler's Fees if the Prisoners were poor. — Gaol-Delivery once a year. — Clauses of Act against Spirituous Liquors not hung up.

I was concerned when I heard at my last visit that the humane Gaoler Mr. Crafter was dead. But his Successor Mr. Harle is equally worthy of the Trust.

Dr. Rotheram, a Physician in this Town, visits the Prisoners very assiduously without Fee or Reward. This is the only instance of the kind I have met with.

MORPETH.

ONLY one Court-yard, which is for Debtors. Some commodious rooms have been lately built for them; the old ones being out of repair. — Felons are always locked within doors. In the Women's room I saw (Jan. 1776) two; who, the Gaoler said, were call for Transportation; one in Sep. 1773, the other in Nov. 1774. The term of their punishment was lengthened by all this Time.

Of the other two rooms, generally appropriated to Men-felons, one is a Day-room, the other an offensive Dungeon. In the latter were three Transports, who upon suspicion of intending an Escape were chained to the floor. — They have not the King's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week.

Gaol-delivery once a year. Assize held at Newcastle, whither Prisoners are conveyed; and men and women confined together, commonly a whole week, in a dirty damp Dungeon down fix steps in the Old Castle.

The County has for some years paid the Gaoler's Fees for acquitted Prisoners, if poor: and cloathed stich Transports as were quite indigent.

The Debtors Court-yard Should be allotted to Felons: and one for Debtors might be taken from the Gaoler's spacious Garden.

THIS GAOL is part of the grand Town-Hall, which was built in 1754, and has a fine Steeple: the only one in the Town. The rooms on the ground floor are damp and Prisoners are not put into them, but over the Hall, where is a long room, or gallery, and seven other rooms, sizeable, but dirty. No court-yard: no water. Clauses of AT against Spirituous Liquors not hung up. The Gaoler keeps a Public-house, distant. He told me he went to the Gaol thrice a day; at nine, one, and eight.

This place, though a distinct jurisdiction, in none of the Circuits, is inserted here, rather than at the end of the English and Welch Counties, because its situation gives it a natural connexion with the last-mentioned County, and it falls in here in the order of my journey through the northern part of the kingdom.

Northern Circuit. CUMBERLAND.

CARLISLE.

THE COURT spacious, eighty-five yards by thirty-fixj but common to all Prisoners. In it a Chapel, built, by the date upon it, 1734. Five rooms for Master's-side Debtors; and as many on the Common-side. Most of the latter are large, but have windows to the street. As there are so many rooms, the not separating men and women is inexcusable.

The Wards for Felons are two rooms down a step or two: dark and dirty. One of them, the Day-room, has a window to the street; through which Spirituous Liquors and Tools for Mischief may be easily conveyed: but the last time I saw it, there was a shutter and padlock to it. The Night-room is only eleven feet by nine. No Infirmary. Transports have not the King's allowance of es. 6d. a week. Clauses of Act against Spirituous Liquors not hung up. Gaol-Delivery once a year.

The Gaol-Fever, which some years ago carried off many of the Prisoners, did not deter Mr. Farish from visiting the sick every day.

Few Gaols have so many convenient rooms for Common-side Debtors. It is the more remarkable here, because there is no 'Table signed by the Magistrates to particularize the Free Wards. Some Gaolers avail themselves of such a Circumstance, and demand rent for rooms which were undoubtedly designed for Common-side Prisoners.

CARLISLE CITY GAOL,

Over the Scotch-Gate. Only one ruinous room about twenty feet square; with a window four feet by one and a half. No allowance but a very small quantity of peat taken as a toll upon that commodity, and water brought twice a day.

I was told that many a poor Traveller from the North who by some Calamity had contracted an unavoidable debt of forty shillings, has been confined at a distance from his Friends in this Prison where there is no Provision, nor any means of procuring it.

THIS GAOL was built by the County. The Earl of cfhanet is Hereditary Sheriff, and pays the Gaoler his Salary. Happily for the Prisoners in a Gaol so circumstaneed, the present Gaoler is a man of temper and humanity.

At page 41 I complained of this Prison being within reach of Floods: but in Jan. 1776 there was a new Building on the highest part of the Yard. It consists of four vaulted Wards for Felons, fifteen feet by thirteen; a window in each, but no chimney: and over them three good rooms with chimneys, for Debtors.

Gaol-delivery once a year. — No Table of Fees.

I have not censured the management of any Work-houses (though highly deserving it) because foreign to my subjetft. But I will take the liberty to extol the oeconomy, industry and cleanliness of the Kendal Work-house. It makes some amends for the inconvenience of the Town Gaol, which occasions the fending Town-Prisoners to the County Bridewell as above.

lan- room. The Free Ward for Debtors is large but dark. These, as

cas.er. wejj as t]10fc of the Master's-side, are allowed to walk and work (spin, knit &c.) in the Crown and Shire Halls. Over the Judge's Bench in the latter is written this text; <c Let Judgment run down as waters, and Righteousness as a nighty Jlream. ”

Petty offenders are sometimes sent hither, because the Bridewells are difbnt. There is a large Room for them near the Gate > and they are, as they should be, kept separate from Felons.

Men and Women-felons have their Day-rooms apart, at the upper end of the Yard. Women deep in their Day-room.. — Men have for their Night-rooms two vaulted Cells. One of them, the Low Dungeon, is ten steps under ground, twenty-one feet by nine, extremely close, dark, and unwholesome; so very hot even in Winter, that coming from it in the morning into the cold air mufl be pernicious. Their other Cell, the High Dungeon, is larger but close and offensive, though not under ground.

I once saw three Felons sick: but the Recorder, Mr. Fenton, gave immediate orders for their relief by better nourishment &c. and they soon recovered. No Infirmary. Transports have not the King's allowance of as. 6d. a week. When Prisoners are convicted at Preston or Manchester, and from thence brought hither, Mr. Dane has a shilling a mile Conduct-Money for each.

Part of the Castle-yard is an inclosed Bowling-Green.

One of the rooms for Debtors is called the Quakers Rcon; because, it is said, when those people were so cruelly persecuted in the last Century, vast numbers of them were confined in it.

If the large Stable which is not much used, and the great Room under the Shire-Hall (in which I saw only one poor Lunatic; who

had

437

had been there many years, and is since dead) were converted into Night-rooms for Felons, one small room for each; and an Infirmary was built, this would be a good Gaol. From Mr. Fenton s humanity, and the regard that isjuftly paid him, I cannot but hope for some of thele Improvements.

The Chaplain's Salary £50 is — from the County £36 — from the Dutchy ,£4 — from a Charity £ to.

I will give a Copy of the Table of Fees, though it is not authentic: and of a Paper in the Shire-Hall containing a List of Donations; though imperfect, and not vouched by any Authority.

CHESTER CASTLE

IS the Property of the king. The first room is a Hall or Chapel: there are two staircases leading up from it to four rooms for Master's-side Debtors. Down eighteen Heps is a small Court-yard, which was common to Debtors and Felons. It is lately divided, but the high close pales which separate the two Courts, now lb very small, deprive both Debtors and Felons of the benefit of fresh air. The former in their free ward, the Popes Kitchen; the latter in their day-room, the King's Kitchen. Both these are fix flops below the Yard: each of them about thirty-five feet by twenty-two. Near the former is the Condemned Room. Under the King's Kitchen is the King's Celiar; quite useless. Under the Pope's Kitchen is a dark Room or Pafiage twenty-four feet by ten: to it you defeend twenty-one Heps from the Yard. On one side of it are fix Cells (Stalls), each about seven feet and a half by three and a half, with a barrack-bedstead, and a small aperture over the door. In each of these are locked up at night, sometimes three or four Felons. No window: not a breath of fresh air: 'only an aperture with a grate in the ceiling of the Pafiage, into the Pope's Kitchen above. They pitch these Dungeons three or four times a year: when I was in one of them, I ordered the door to be shut; and my situation brought to mind what I had heard of the Black Hole at Calcutta.

The Felons Day-room is not secure. They escaped in 1775 by breaking through the flight floor into the King's Cellar below; and through the decayed walls of that they made their way down the hill. The Keeper, who is careful and humane, was not blameable.

I have in two of my visits seen the places of confinement for Deserers in this Caille, who are not under the care of the Gaoler, but of the Invalids of the Garrison. They arc bad unhealthy Cells; often productive of the Gaol-Fever. An Officer at Worcester informed me, that having sent a Serjeant and two Men for two Deserters lodged here, three of them died a few days after they came to their quarters, and he had them buried privately, without military honours, to the surprize of the Soldiers, who ktrew not the reason,

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at MIDDLEWICH,

This Prison has been lately much improved by the addition of a Work-room; a little Room at the end of it, -which they call a Shop; and fotne Chambers over them. At one side of the Work-room is a strong brick Bench against the wall, long enough for several to fit on: and fronting the fire-place is another strong brick Seat, almost a semicircle. Two of the old Rooms have now a window in each: the other have only perforations in the doors. I found at my last visit all the Prisoners, but two, employed in picking Oakum; the other two were Shoe-makers, working at their own trade. The Yard is enlarged from the Keeper's Garden, and flagged with broad stones, which are very convenient, not only for cleanliness &c. but particularly for drying the Oakum. The Partition between this and the Garden, is a brick wall about one third of the height, and the rest strong palisades with tenter-hooks. This is a judicious contrivance for keeping the Yard and House airy and healthy.

CHESTER CITY.

THIS GAOL, called the North-Gate Prison, has many convenient apartments for Debtors. The Felons Day-room is spacious: but to their Dungeon, or Night-room, you go down fourteen steps, Ic is fourteen feet by eight, and seven high. No light nor any communication with the external air, but at the door. The Prisoners in March 1774 complained of excessive heat: but in my latter visits I found they had been lodged elsewhere. No bedding nor straw. The Court-yard is common to Debtors and Felons: but the former have the privilege of walking in the Keeper's Garden.

Mr. Duke is Chaplain to the Blue-Coat School; and officiates in little. St. John's Chapel belonging to the School. A Navigation parts that from the Prison-yard; and a foot bridge, made for the purpose, gives these Prisoners an opportunity of attending Divine Service when it is performed; that is Prayers twice a week, and Sermon once a month. Few Prisoners in City or Town Gaols have such a privilege.

In November 1775 several Prisoners were ill in bed of the Cold which then generally prevailed; yet the Surgeon had not, for three weeks, either seen them himself, or sent his man.

Out of repair; and not safe: no yard: no water: no allowance: no employment. They are building a large Workshop, and rooms over it. Below are two new Dungeons about nine feet under ground, I told the Keeper that I wished the Contriver of these might be the first who lodged in them. I heard they intend to enclose a Courtyard: I hope they will not forget a Pump.

Here were several leaden weights marked 30, 40, 60 pounds, with a ring and chains to each: these are fattened, as the Magistrates order, or the Keeper finds needful, to the legs of refractor)' Prisoners, that they may not walk without carrying the weight. The Keeper said he had some Women so turbulent that it was extremely difficult to make them behave orderly, while they were kept together.

This is down eight steps: rain comes through the roof upon the barrack-beds. A Court before it about five yards square: water laid in When Men are here. Women are put in the dark Closets.

Great sessions at Mold: Conveyance thither at the Gaoler's Expense. He has a Salary of/a5 as Keeper of Bridewell.

Near twenty years ago, here was a Debtor who infilled upon not being subject to the Gaoler, nor to any Orders but such as should be enjoined by the Magistrates. Upon this occasion, the Justices-at the Quarter Sessions held at Holywell in July 1759 made some faluta-ry Rules for the government of this Prison, relembling those for Chester Castle, which are hung up in the Gaol. It is probable the man knew he had a Statute to support his claim, namely, the Act the 3 2d of George the Second.

The condemned Dungeon is damp; a small window. One Court-yard; but it is spacious. A House for the Gaoler, lately built in the yard; but he dill lives didant, as before. It has convenient rooms for Mader's-side Debtors; and an Alarm Bell at top: by ringing it, a Debtor lately prevented an escape of the Felons. No water: the Well is useless; and the Gaol oft'enfive. — Houses in the neighbourhood have water laid in — Transports have not the King's allowance of as. 6d. a week. Clauses of the Act against Spirituous Liquors not hung up. No Table of Fees. J. Williams has: 12: o a year as Keeper of Bridewell. To this Prison there are Rules or Bounds, which extend near a mile round.

Two of the Offenders, whom I saw lad time, were for Fives which they can never pay. They have not the County-allowance, and were almost darved.

The Gaoler was desirous of farming the Allowance: but the abuse of such a trust by the Gaoler at Brecon had been detested; and the request of this Gaoler was not granted.

CARDIFF.

Remarks. THE NEW GAOL, not finished, is to consist of three separate Houses, with Court-yards between them. The Old Gaol to be taken down; and in Front (where it now Hands), is to be the House for Debtors: a Court behind it — Then the Gaoler's House: this is built; two rooms on a floor. Behind it, the Felons Court-yard; and beyond that, their House or Wards; which are also built: on the ground-floor, a small room for the Turnkey; and three vaulted rooms: above them three chambers, twelve feet and a half by ten.

The Gaoler's house being in the middle, he will have both Debtors and Felons in view: but his passing to the street through the Debtors house, may be dangerous to him when they prove riotous.

He undertakes for £40 a year to pay Felons ten pence halfpenny a week; and find them straw: and to pay a Hilling a week to such Debtors as the Justices shall appoint. No Table of Fees.

Great sessions always at Cowbridge. — The late Gaoler informed me, that an Exchequer Debtor confined ten years for seven pounds died in the Gaol just before I was there.

Besides the Old Room, there are two Rooms lately built in the Back-yard; each fifteen feet square. In them provision is made for the circulation of air; and there is now little danger of the Gaol-Fever of which the Keeper told me, at my first visit, many had died: a man and woman about a year before; when himself and his daughter were also ill of it. No fewer: no water: no Court-yard; one may be easily enclosed from the Ground adjacent. No allowance. Keeper's Salary £25: 12; o.

CONCLUSION.

IT was once my intention to have published the preceding account of English Prisons,* without any of the introductory matter which compotes the former part of this Volume. But thinking, from a close attention to the subject, that it was in my power in some instances to suggest remedies to the evils which I had been witness of; and aware of the common proverbial objection “that it is easier to find faults than to mend them;” I imagined I should be culpable in suppressing any thing which might conduce to improvement in a matter I had so much at heart.

A person of more ability, with my knowledge of facts, would have written better: but my ambition was not the

* My Readers will observe that I do not give this as an account of every single Prison in the Kingdom. Some, doubtless, have escaped my researches; for it was only by assiduous enquiries in my frequent journeys that I was able to discover all those I have mentioned. It will readily be conceived, however, that those I have missed must be of very small consequence.

488 CONCLUSION.

fame of an Author. Hearing the cries of the miserable, I devoted my time to their relief. In order to procure it, I made it my business to collect materials, the authenticity of which could not be disputed. For the warmth of some expressions where my subject obliges me to complain, and for my eagerness to remove the several grievances, my only apology must be drawn from the deep distress of the sufferers, and the impressions the view of it excited in me — impressions too strong to be effaced by any length of time!

What I have proposed throughout my work is liable, I am sensible, to some objections; and these will, doubtless, be heightened by the cavils of those whose interest it is to prevent the reformation of abuses on which their ease or emolument may depend. Yet I hope not to be entirely deserted in the conflict: and, if this publication shall have any effect in alleviating the distresses of poor Debtors and other Prisoners — in procuring for them cleanly and wholesome abodes; and thereby exterminating the Gaol-fever, which has so often spread abroad its dreadful contagion — in abolishing, or at least reducing, the oppressive fees of Clerks of Assize, and of the Peace; and checking the impositions of Gaolers, and the extortion of Bailiffs — in introducing a habit of industry in our Bridewells; and restraining the shocking debauchery and immorality which prevail in our Gaols and other Prisons — if any of these beneficial consequences shall

CONCLUSION. 489

accrue, the writer will be ready to indulge himself with the pleasing thought of not having lived without doing some good to his fellow-creatures; and will think himself abundantly repaid for all the pains he has taken, the time he has spent, and the hazards he has undergone.

Nothing effectual will, however, I am persuaded, be done in reforming the state of our Prisons, till a thorough Parliamentary Inquiry concerning them be set on foot, on which may be grounded one comprehensive Statute for their general regulation. Should this be undertaken, I would cheerfully (relying still on the protection of that kind hand which has hitherto preserved me, and to which I desire to offer my most thankful acknowledgments!) devote my time to one more extensive foreign journey, in which the Prussian and Austrian Territories, and the most considerable free Cities of Germany would probably afford some new and useful lights on this important national concern.
