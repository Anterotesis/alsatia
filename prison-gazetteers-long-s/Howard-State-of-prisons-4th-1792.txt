INTRODUCTION.

THE distress of prisoners, of which there are few who have not some imperfect idea, came more immediately under my notice when I was sheriff of the county of Bedford*; and the circumstance which excited me to activity in their behalf was, the seeing, some — who by the verdict of juries were declared not guilty, some — on whom the grand jury did not find such an appearance of guilt as subjected them to trial; and some — whose prosecutors did not appear against them; — after having been confined for months, dragged back to gaol, and locked up again till they should pay sundry fees to the gaoler, the clerk of assize, &c.

In order to redress this hardship, I applied to the justices of the county for a salary to the gaoler in lieu of his fees. The bench were properly affected with the grievance, and willing to grant the relief desired: but they wanted a precedent for charging the county with the expence. I therefore rode into several neighbouring counties in search of one; but I soon learned that the same injustice was practised in them; and looking into the prisons, I beheld scenes of calamity, which I grew daily more and more anxious to alleviate. In order therefore to gain a more perfect knowledge of the particulars and extent of it, by various and accurate observation, I visited most of the county gaols in England.

Seeing in two or three of them some poor creatures whose aspect was singularly deplorable, and asking the cause of it, the answer was, "they were lately brought from the bridewells." This started a fresh subject of inquiry. I resolved to inspect the bridewells: and for that purpose travelled again into the counties where I had been; and, indeed, into all the rest; examining houses of correction, city and town gaols. I beheld in many of them, as well as in the county gaols, a complication of distress;

* In 1773.

but my attention was principally fixed by the gaol-fever and the small-pox, which I saw prevailing to the destruction of multitudes, not only of felons in their dungeons, but of debtors also.

The gaol-fever is no new subject of complaint. Stow, in his Survey, mentions*, that "in the year 1414, the gaolers of Newgate and Ludgate dyed, and prisoners in Newgate to the number of sixty-four." And speaking of the King's Bench prison†, says, that in the six years preceding the year 1579, one hundred prisoners died there: and twelve between Michaelmas and March of the last mentioned year, "through a certain contagion called the sickness of the house;" and I shall presently have occasion, among the fatal effects of this distemper propagated from prisons, and infecting many abroad, to mention another ancient instance of that sort also. These effects are now so notorious, that what terrifies most of us from looking into prisons, is the gaol-distemper so frequent in them.

Upon this subject I was examined in the House of Commons in March 1774: when I had the honour of their thanks. Soon after that, Mr. Popham, member for Taunton, repeated the humane attempt which had miscarried a few years before; and brought in a bill for the relief of prisoners who should be acquitted — respecting their fees; and another bill for preserving the health of prisoners, and preventing the gaol-distemper. They both passed, that sessions: these two acts I had printed in a different character, and sent them to the keeper of every county gaol in England. By those acts, the tear was wiped from many an eye; and the legislature had for them "the blessing of many that were ready to perish."

The great honour done me by the House has excited the curiosity of some to inquire what facts I had collected. This is one reason of the present publication: but it is not the only, nor yet the principal one. There are still remaining, many disorders that ought to be rectified: prisoners suffer great hardships, from which I am desirous that they should be set free: the gaol-fever is not, as I am persuaded it may be, totally eradicated. These are my motives for printing this book. I think it will shew plainly, that much is yet to be done for the regulation of prisons; and I am not without hope, that the legislature will finish what was so laudably begun.

I was called to the first part of my talk by my office as sheriff. To the pursuit of it I was prompted by the sorrows of the sufferers, and love to my country. The work grew upon me insensibly. I could not enjoy my ease and leisure in the neglect of an opportunity offered me by Providence of attempting the relief of the miserable. The attention of parliament to the subject, led me to conclude that some additional labour would not be lost; and I extended my plan. The difficulty I found in searching out evidence of fraud and cruelty in various articles, together with other real sources of distress, obliged me to repeat my visits, and travel over the kingdom more than once: and after all, I suspect that many frauds have been concealed from me; and

that sometimes the interest of my informants prevailed over their veracity. Besides, as I had in my first journies gathered, from facts and experience, proofs of the mischievous effects of the want of cleanliness and fresh air, I had in my latter visits these strong arguments to enforce my persuasions; and, in consequence, some gaolers grew at last more mindful and complying, for the sake, not only of their prisoners, but of themselves and their own families.

It was not, I own, without some apprehensions of danger, that I first visited the prisons; and I guarded myself by smelling to vinegar, while I was in those places, and changing my apparel afterwards. This I did constantly and carefully when I began; but by degrees I grew less attentive to these precautions, and have long since entirely omitted them*. On account of the alteration made by the act for preferring the health of prisoners, one may now look into many a prison without gaining an idea of the condition it was in a few years ago. I wish the reformation to be not for the present only, but lasting. If the motive for amendment, has any where been merely temporary, there is no doubt but the effect will cease with the cause: those who from such inducement have obeyed, will in future follow the example of others who have disregarded the law; and prisons that have been amended, will relapse into their former state.

As to what is still wrong, I set down matter of fact without amplification; which would in the end rather impede than promote the object of my wishes; that is, the correction of what is really amiss.

The journies were not undertaken for the traveller's amusement; and the collections are not published for general entertainment; but for the perusal of those who have it in their power to give redress to the sufferers.

The writer begs his reader to excuse the frequent egotisms; which he did not know how to avoid, without using circumlocutions that might have been more disgusting.

* I have been frequently asked what precautions I use, to preserve myself from infection in the prisons and hospitals which I visit. I here answer, next to the free goodness and mercy of the Author of my being, temperance and cleanliness are my preservatives. Trading in Divine Providence, and believing myself in the way of my duty, I visit the most noxious cells; and while thus employed, "I fear no evil." — I never enter an hospital or prison before breakfast, and in an offensive room I seldom draw my breath deeply.

SECTION I.

GENERAL VIEW OF DISTRESS IN PRISONS.

THERE are prisons, into which whoever looks will, at first sight of the people confined, be convinced, that there is some great error in the management of them: their sallow meagre countenances declare, without words, that they are very miserable. Many who went in healthy, are in a few months changed to emaciated dejected objects. Some are seen pining under diseases, "sick, and in prison;" expiring on the floors, in loathsome cells, of pestilential fevers, and the confluent small-pox: victims, I must not say to the cruelty, but I will say to the inattention, of sheriffs, and gentlemen in the commission of the peace.

The cause of this distress is, that many prisons are scantily supplied, and some almost totally destitute of the necessaries of life.

[Food.]

There are several bridewells (to begin with them) in which prisoners have no allowance of Food at all. In some, the keeper farms what little is allowed them: and where he engages to supply each prisoner with one or two pennyworth of bread a day, I have known this shrunk to half, sometimes less than half the quantity, cut or broken from his own loaf.

It will perhaps be asked, does not their work maintain them? for every one knows that those offenders are committed to hard labour. The answer to that question, though true, will hardly be believed. There are few bridewells in which any work is done, or can be done. The prisoners have neither tools, nor materials of any kind: but spend their time in sloth, profaneness and debauchery, to a degree which, in some of those houses that I have seen, is extremely shocking.

Some keepers of these houses, who have represented to the magistrates the wants of their prisoners, and desired for them necessary food, have been silenced with these inconsiderate words, Let them work or starve. When those gentlemen know the former is impossible, do they not by that thoughtless sentence, inevitably doom poor creatures to the latter?

Sect. 1. DISTRESS IN PRISONS. 5

I have asked some keepers, since the late act for preserving the health of prisoners, why no care is taken of their sick: and have been answered, that the magistrates tell them the act does not extend to bridewells*.

In consequence of this, at the quarter sessions you see prisoners, covered (hardly covered) with rags; almost famished; and sick of diseases, which the discharged spread where they go; and with which those who are sent to the county-gaols infect these prisons.

The same complaint, want of food, is to be found in many county gaols. In above half these, debtors have no bread; although it is granted to the highwayman, the house-breaker, and the murderer: and medical assistance, which is provided for the latter, is withheld from the former. In many of these gaols, debtors who would work are not permitted to have any tools, lest they should furnish felons with them for escape or other mischief. I have often seen these prisoners eating their water-soup (bread boiled in mere water) and heard them say, "We are locked up and almost starved to death."

As to the relief provided for debtors by the benevolent act, 32d of George II. (commonly called the lords act, because it originated in their house) I did not find in all England and Wales (except the counties of Middlesex and Surrey) twelve debtors who had obtained from their creditors the four-pence a day, to which they had a right by that act. The means of procuring it were out of their reach. In one of my journies I found near six hundred prisoners, whose debts were under twenty pounds each: some of them did not owe above three or four pounds: and the expence of sueing for the aliment is in many places equal to the small debts; for which some of these prisoners had been confined several months.

At Carlisle but one debtor of the forty-nine whom I saw there in 1774, had obtained his groats: and the gaoler told me, that during the time he had held that office, which was fourteen years, no more than four or five had received it; and that they were soon discharged by their creditors neglecting to pay it. No one debtor had the aliment in York castle, Devon, Cheshire, Kent, and many other counties. The truth is, some debtors are the most pitiable objects in our gaols.

To their wanting necessary food, I must add not only the demands of gaolers, &c. for fees; but also the extortion of bailiffs. These detain in their houses, (properly enough denominated spunging-houses) at an enormous expence, prisoners who have money. I know there is a legal provision against this oppression; but the mode of obtaining redress (like that of recovering the groats) is attended with difficulty: and the abuse continues. The rapine of these extortioners needs some more effectual and

* If the late act does not include bridewells, it is required, by an act 7th James I. Cap. IV. that "the masters and governors of — houses of correction shall have some fit allowance — for the relieving of such as shall happen to be weak and sick in their custody."

6 GENERAL VIEW OF

easy check: no bailiff should be suffered to keep a public house; the mischiefs occasioned by their so doing, are complained of in many parts of the kingdom*.

Here I beg leave to mention the hard case of prisoners confined on exchequer processes; and those from the ecclesiastical courts: the latter are excluded from the privilege of bail; and the former, generally, from the benefit of insolvent acts.

Felons have in some gaols two pennyworth of bread a day; in some three halfpennyworth; in some a pennyworth; in some none: the particulars will be seen hereafter in their proper places. I often weighed the bread in different prisons, and found the penny loaf seven ounces and a half to eight ounces, the other loaves in proportion. It is probable that when this allowance was fixed by its value, near double the quantity that the money will now purchase, might be bought for it†: yet the allowance continues unaltered: and it is not uncommon to see the whole purchase, especially of the smaller sums, eaten at breakfast; which is sometimes the case when they receive their pittance but once in two days: and then on the following day they must fast.

This allowance being so far short of the cravings of nature, and in some prisons lessened by farming to the gaoler, many criminals are half starved: such of them as at their commitment were in health, come out almost famished, scarce able to move, and for weeks incapable of any labour.

[Water.]

Many prisons have no Water. This defect is frequent in bridewells, and town gaols. In the felons courts of some county-gaols there is no water: in some places where there is water, prisoners are always locked up within doors, and have no more than the keeper or his servants think fit to bring them: in one place they were limited to three pints a day each: a scanty provision for drink and cleanliness

[Air.]

And as to Air, which is no less necessary than either of the two preceding articles, and given us by Providence quite gratis, without any care or labour of our own; yet, as if the bounteous goodness of Heaven excited our envy, methods are contrived to rob prisoners of this genuine cordial of life, as Dr. Hales very properly calls it: I mean by preventing that circulation and change of the salutiferous fluid, without which animals cannot live and thrive. It is well known that air which has performed its office in the lungs, is feculent and noxious. Writers upon the subject shew, that a hogshead of air will last a man only an hour: but those who do not choose to consult

* By the statute 32d George II. it is enacted, that "No sheriff, bailiff, &c — shall convey any person arrested — to any public victualling or other drinking-house — without the consent of the person so arrested." Now if the bailiff himself keeps a public house, this seems to preclude the debtor's choice; he must go to a public house, or directly to gaol.

† In 1557, a penny loaf of wheat bread weighed twenty-six ounces. In 1782, the weight of a twopenny white loaf, at London, was eighteen ounces; at Edinburgh, nineteen ounces and a half; at Dublin, sixteen ounces; in September 1783, at London, one pound three ounces; and the 4th of August 1783, in Dublin, only eleven ounces three drachms.

philosophers, may judge from a notorious fact. In 1756, at Calcutta in Bengal, out of a hundred and seventy persons who were confined in a hole there one night, a hundred and fifty-four were taken out dead. The few survivors ascribed the mortality to their want of fresh air; and called the place Hell in miniature.

Air which has been breathed, is made poisonous to a more intense degree, by the effluvia from the sick, and what else in prisons is offensive. My reader will judge of its malignity, when I assure him, that my clothes were in my first journies so offensive, that in a post-chaise I could not bear the windows drawn up; and was therefore obliged to travel commonly on horseback. The leaves of my memorandum-book were often so tainted, that I could not use it till after spreading it an hour or two before the fire: and even my antidote, a vial of vinegar, has, after using it in a few prisons, become intolerably disagreeable. I did not wonder that in those journies many gaolers made excuses; and did not go with me into the felons wards.

I learn from a letter to Sir Robert Ladbroke, printed in 1771, page 11, that "Dr. Hales, Sir John Pringle, and others have observed, that air, corrupted and putrefied, is of such a subtile and powerful nature, as to rot and dissolve heart of oak; and that the walls of buildings have been impregnated with this poisonous matter for years together*."

From hence any one may judge of the probability there is against the health, and life, of prisoners crowded in close rooms, cells, and subterraneous dungeons, for fourteen or fifteen hours out of the four-and-twenty. In some of those caverns the floor is very damp: in others there is sometimes an inch or two of water: and the straw, or bedding, is laid on such floors; seldom on barrack-bedsteads. Where prisoners are not kept in under-ground cells, they are often confined to their rooms, because there is no court belonging to the prison, which is the case in many city and town gaols: or because the walls round the yard are ruinous, or too low for safety: or because the gaoler has the ground for his own use. Prisoners confined in this manner, are generally unhealthy.

[Sewers.]

Some gaols have no Sewers or vaults; and in those that have, if they be not properly attended to, they are, even to a visitant, offensive beyond expression: how noxious then to people constantly confined in those prisons†!

One cause why the rooms in some prisons are so close, is the window-tax which

* See also the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. XLVIII. Part I. page 42.

† An act made in Ireland the 3d year of his present Majesty, for better preventing the severities, &c." has the following clause: "Whereas many infectious disorders are daily produced by the confinement of numbers in close prisons, whereunto there is no back-yard adjoining, and the lives of his Majesty's subjects are endangered by the bringing of prisoners into public streets for air; be it enacted — that every grand jury at the assizes or quarter sessions — may be enabled, and they are hereby required and directed, to contract either by lease, or to purchase a piece of ground next adjoining the gaol, or as near as conveniently can be had thereto, and cause to be erected necessary houses, and a wall sufficient for the security of the said prisoners."

8 GENERAL VIEW OF

the gaolers have to pay: this tempts them to stop the windows, and stifle their prisoners*.

[Bedding.]

In many gaols, and in most bridewells, there is no allowance of Bedding or straw for prisoners to sleep on; and if by any means they get a little, it is not changed for months together, so that it is offensive and almost worn to dust. Some lie upon rags, others upon the bare floors. When I have complained of this to the keepers, their justification has been, "The county allows no straw; the prisoners have none but at my cost."

[Morals.]

The evils mentioned hitherto affect the health and life of prisoners. I have now to complain of what is pernicious to their Morals; and that is, the confining all sorts of prisoners together: debtors and felons, men and women, the young beginner and the old offender; and with all these, in some counties, such as are guilty of misdemeanors only; who should have been committed to bridewell to be corrected, by diligence and labour; but for want of food, and the means of procuring it in those prisons, are in pity sent to such county gaols as afford these offenders prison-allowance.

Few prisons separate men and women in the day-time. In some counties the gaol is also the bridewell: in others those prisons are contiguous, and the court-yard common. There the petty offender is committed for instruction to the most profligate. In some gaols you see (and who can see it without sorrow) boys of twelve or fourteen eagerly listening to the stories told by practised and experienced criminals, of their adventures, successes, stratagems, and escapes.

[Lunatics.]

I must here add, that in some few gaols are confined idiots and Lunatics. These serve for sport to idle visitants at assizes, and other times of general resort. Many of the bridewells are crowded and offensive, because the rooms which were designed for prisoners are occupied by the insane†. Where these are not kept separate, they disturb and terrify other prisoners. No care is taken of them, although it is probable that by medicines, and proper regimen, some of them might be restored to their senses, and to usefulness in life.

[Gaol-fever.]

I am ready to think, that none who give credit to what is contained in the foregoing pages, will wonder at the havock made by the Gaol-fever. From my own observations in 1773, 1774 and 1775, I was fully convinced that many more prisoners were destroyed by it, than were put to death by all the public executions in the

* This is also the case in many work-houses and farm-houses, where the poor and the labourer are lodged in rooms that have no light, nor fresh air: which may be the cause of our peasants not having the healthy ruddy complexions one used to see so common twenty or thirty years ago. The difference has often struck one in my various journies.

† See Irish Act, the 3d of George III. p. 478. where such persons are required to be kept separate.

Sect. 1. DISTRESS IN PRISONS. 9

kingdom*. This frequent effect of confinement in prison seems generally understood, and shews how full of emphatical meaning is the curse of a severe creditor, who pronounces his debtor's doom to rot in gaol. I believe I have learned the full import of this sentence, from the vast numbers who, to my certain knowledge, and some of them before my eyes, have perished by the gaol-fever.

But the mischief is not confined to prisons. Not to mention now the number of sailors, and of families in America, that have been infected by transports; — multitudes caught the distemper by going to their relatives and acquaintance in the gaols: many others from prisoners discharged; and not a few in the courts of judicature.

In Baker's Chronicle, page 353, that historian mentioning the assize held in Oxford castle 1577 (called from its fatal consequence the black assize) informs us, that "all who were present died within forty hours: the lord chief baron, the sheriff, and about three hundred more." Lord chancellor Bacon ascribes this to a disease brought into court by the prisoners; and Dr. Mead is of the same opinion.

The first of these two authors, Lord Bacon, observes, that "the most pernicious infection next the plague, is the smell of a jail; when the prisoners have been long and close and nastily kept: whereof we have had, in our time, experience twice or thrice; when both the judges that sat upon the jail, and numbers of those who attended the "business, or were present, sickened and died†."

At the Lent assize in Taunton, 1730, some prisoners who were brought thither from Ivelchester gaol, infected the court; and lord chief baron Pengelly; Sir James Sheppard, sergeant; John Pigot, Esq. sheriff, and some hundreds besides, died of the gaol-distemper. At Axminster, a little town in Devonshire, a prisoner discharged from Exeter gaol in 1755, infected his family with that disease; of which two of them died; and many others in that town afterwards. — The numbers that were carried off by the same malady in London in 1750, two judges, the lord mayor, one

* I have in my possession a large copper-plate, first published in 1772, by Sir Stephen Theodore Janssen, shewing the number of malefactors executed in London for the twenty-three preceding years; and the crimes for which they suffered. I will give an abridgment of it in a table at the end of the book. In it will be seen, that the total number of executions in London for those twenty-three years, was 678; the annual average is between 29 and 30. I leave to others the discussion of the questions, whether those executions were too numerous? whether all the crimes for which they were inflicted, were deserving of death? An ingenious writer, Mr. Eden, Principles of Penal Law, page 306, observes that "the accumulation of sanguinary laws is the worst distemper of a state. Let it not be supposed, that the extirpation of mankind is the chief object of legislation." — And it may be left to any one to judge, whether, including debtors and petty offenders, the number of those that died in the several London prisons of the gaol-fever, does not exceed the number of those that were executed annually during that time. I have not the number of executions in all the counties, but am well assured it falls still much shorter of the number that perished in prisons.

alderman, and many of inferior rank, are too well known to need the mentioning farther particulars.

Sir John Pringle observes, that "jails have often been the cause of malignant fevers;" and he informs us, that in the late rebellion in Scotland, above two hundred men of one regiment were infected with the jail-fever, by some deserters brought from prisons in England*.

Dr. Lind, physician to the royal hospital at Haslar, near Portsmouth, shewed me in one of the wards a number of sailors ill of the gaol-fever, brought on board their ship by a man who had been discharged from a prison in London. The ship was laid up on the occasion. That gentleman, in his Essay on the Health of Seamen, asserts, that "The source of infection to our armies and fleets are undoubtedly the jails; we can often trace the importers of it directly from them. — It often proves fatal in impressing men on the hasty equipment of a fleet†. — The first English fleet sent last war to America, lost by it above two thousand men." In another place he allures us, that "the seeds of infection were carried from the guard-ships into our squadrons — and the mortality, thence occasioned, was greater than by all other diseases or means of death put together‡."

It were easy to multiply instances of this mischief; but those which have been mentioned are, I presume, sufficient to shew, even if no mercy were due to prisoners, that the gaol-distemper is a national concern of no small importance.

[Vicious Examples.]

The general prevalence and spread of wickedness in prisons, and abroad by the discharged prisoners, will now be as easily accounted for, as the propagation of disease. It is often said, "A prison pays no debt;" I am sure it may be added, that a prison mends no morals. Sir John Fielding observes, that "a criminal discharged — generally by the next sessions, after the execution of his comrades, becomes the head of a gang of his own raising:" — improved, no doubt, in skill by the company he kept in gaol. And petty offenders who are committed to bridewell for a year or two, and spend that time, not in hard labour, but in idleness and wicked company, or are sent for that time to county gaols, generally grow desperate, and come out fitted for the perpetration of any villany. — Half the robberies committed in and about London, are planned in the prisons, by that dreadful assemblage of criminals, and the number of idle people who visit them. — How contrary this to the intention of our laws with regard to petty offenders; which certainly is to correct and reform them! Instead of which, their confinement doth notoriously promote and increase the very vices it was designed to suppress. Multitudes of young creatures, committed for some trifling offence, are totally ruined there. I make no scruple to affirm, that if it were the wish and aim of magistrates to effect the destruction, present and future, of young delinquents, they could not devise

a more effectual method, than to confine them so long in our prisons, those seats and seminaries (as they have been very properly called) of idleness and every vice.

Shall these irregularities, the sources of misery, disease, and wickedness, be endured in a nation celebrated for good sense and humanity; and who from these principles, do treat one sort of prisoners with tenderness and generosity? I mean prisoners of war. These have provision in plenty; some to spare and sell to the soldiers on guard*; we frequently saw their stated allowance hung up for their inspection. Some prisons have large areas for them to walk in; and at night every man had a hammock to himself. It is the farthest thing in the world from my wish to deprive captives of any one of these benefits — I am only desirous of seeing the same humanity shewn to our own countrymen in distress: so that a consistent and uniform practice may prove our benevolence to be a firm and steady principle; and that those who are censorious may find no occasion for ascribing our kind usage of foreigners to a less amiable motive.

Here it will be said, prisoners of war are not felons, nor yet debtors; and government is sometimes, at the end of a war, reimbursed the expence of maintaining them. This latter I believe is fact; and the former is true without dispute: we do not look upon foreign enemies, nor they upon us†, as either debtors or felons: we cut one another to pieces in battle, but when that is over we grow cool and compassionate. I grant there is a material difference in the circumstances of foreign and domestic

* I am now speaking of the practice of the war before last. The daily allowance, to six prisoners was, nine pounds of bread — four pounds and a half of beef — three pints of pease, four days in a week — six quarts of beer. — On Friday they had not the beef; but a pound and a half of butter instead of it. — On board the men of war, indeed, they were upon short allowance.

† I must not be understood here to mean a compliment to the French. How they then treated English prisoners of war, I knew by experience in 1756; when a Lisbon packet (the Hanover) in which I went passenger, in order to make the tour of Portugal, was taken by a French privateer. Before we reached Brest, I suffered the extremity of thirst, not having for above forty hours one drop of water; nor hardly a morsel of food. In the castle at Brest, I lay six nights upon straw: and observing how cruelly my countrymen were used there, and at Morlaix, whither I was carried next; during the two months I was at Carhaix upon parole, I corresponded with the English prisoners at Brest, Morlaix, and Dinnan: at the last of those towns were several of our ship's crew, and my servant. I had sufficient evidence of their being treated with such barbarity, that many hundreds had perished; and that thirty-six were buried in a hole at Dinnan in one day. When I came to England, still on parole, I made known to the commissioners of sick and wounded seamen, the sundry particulars: which gained their attention, and thanks. Remonstrance was made to the French court: our sailors had redress: and those that were in the three prisons mentioned above, were brought home in the first cartel-ships. — A Lady from Ireland, who married in France, had bequeathed in trust with the magistrates of St. Malo's, sundry charities; one of which was a penny a day to every English prisoner of war in Dinnan. This was duly paid; and saved the lives of many brave and useful men. — Perhaps, what I suffered on this occasion, increased my sympathy with the unhappy people, whose case is the subject of this book.

12 BAD CUSTOMS.

prisoners, but there is none in their nature. Debtors and felons, as well as hostile foreigners, are men, and by men they ought to be treated as men.

Those gentlemen who, when they are told of the misery which our prisoners suffer, content themselves with saying, Let them take care to keep out, prefaced perhaps, with an angry prayer; seem not duly sensible of the favour of Providence which distinguishes them from the sufferers: they do not remember that we are required to imitate our gracious Heavenly Parent, who is kind to the unthankful, and to the evil: they also forget the vicissitudes of human affairs; the unexpected changes to which all men are liable: and that those whose circumstances are affluent, may in time be reduced to indigence, and become debtors and prisoners. And as to criminality, it is possible, that a man who has often shuddered at hearing the account of a murder, may on a sudden temptation commit that very crime. Let him that thinks he standeth take heed lest he fall, and commiserate those that are fallen.

But it may be said, enough of the declamatory kind has been written by others. Much, it is true, has been written: and I beg leave to transcribe almost verbatim a few lines from a celebrated author, which may be thought to come under that description. After representing the sufferings of prisoners, he goes on to this purpose, "The misery suffered in gaols is not half their evil; they are filled with every sort of corruption that poverty and wickedness can generate: with all the shameless and profligate enormities that can be produced by the impudence of ignominy, the rage of want, and the malignity of despair. In a prison the check of the public eye is removed; and the power of the law is spent. There are few fears, there are no blushes. The lewd inflame the more modest; the audacious harden the timid. Everyone fortifies himself as he can against his own remaining sensibility; endeavouring to practise on others the arts that are practised on himself; and to gain the applause of his worst associates by imitating their manners."

Besides the grievances already mentioned; there are several bad customs in gaols, and relating to them, which aggravate the distress of prisoners. I shall enumerate these distinctly, yet concisely.

SECTION II.

BAD CUSTOMS IN PRISONS.

[Garnish.]

A CRUEL custom obtains in most of our gaols, which is that of the prisoners demanding of a new comer Garnish, footing, or (as it is called in some London gaols) chummage. "Pay or strip," are the fatal words. I say fatal, for they are so to some; who having no money, are obliged to give up part of their scanty apparel;

Sect. II. BAD CUSTOMS. 13

and then if they have no bedding or straw to sleep on, contract diseases, which I have known to prove mortal*.

In many gaols, to the garnish paid by the new comer, those who were there before make an addition; and great part of the following night is often spent in riot and drunkenness. The gaoler or tapster finding his account in this practice, generally answers questions concerning it with reluctance. Of the garnish which I have set down to sundry prisons, I had my information from prisoners who paid it. But I am aware that the sum is sometimes varied by sets of succeeding prisoners, and the different circumstances of a new comer. In some gaols, if a felon can pay the debtors garnish (which is commonly more than that of the felons) he is entitled to partake of the garnish paid afterwards by new-come debtors. In a few places, this demand has been lately waved; in two or three, strictly prohibited by the magistrates.

[Gaming.]

Gaming in various forms is very frequent; cards, dice, skittles, missisippi and por tobello-tables, billiards, fives, tennis, &c. In the country the three first are most common; and especially cards. There is scarce a county gaol but is furnished with them: and one can seldom go in without seeing prisoners at play. In London, all the sorts that I have named were till lately in use. I am not an enemy to diverting exercise: yet the riot, brawling, and profaneness, that are the usual consequences of their play; the circumstances of debtors gaming away the property of their creditors, which I know they have done in some prisons to a considerable amount; accomplishing themselves in the frauds of gamblers, who, if they be not themselves prisoners, are sure to haunt where gaming is practised; hindering their fellow-prisoners from walking in the courts while they play, of which inconvenience I have heard them complain: these seem to me cogent reasons for prohibiting all kinds of gaming within the walls of a prison.

[Irons.]

Loading prisoners with heavy Irons, which make their walking, and even lying down to sleep, difficult and painful, is another custom which I cannot but condemn. In some county gaols and even bridewells the women do not escape this severity: but in London they do: and therefore it is not necessary in the country†. The practice must be mere tyranny: unless it proceed from avarice; which I rather suspect; because county gaolers do sometimes grant dispensations, and indulge their prisoners,

* "In the year 1730, Nicholas Bennet, Joseph Robinson, John Head and George Taverner, were indicted at the Old Bailey for robbing John Berrisford of two half-guineas, two sixpences, and two halfpence, in New Prison under the pretence of garnish, which fact being plainly proved, they were all found guilty of an assault and robbery; and to deter others from the infamous and inhuman practice of taking the money, and if they had none, of stripping poor prisoners that were upon any account committed to prison, so that often-times they have perished for want of cloathing and necessaries, they received sentence of death." Burton's New View of London, page 468.

14 BAD CUSTOMS.

men as well as women, with what they call of "the choice of irons," if they will pay for it.

The author of A Letter to Sir Robert Ladbroke on Prisons (particularly on Newgate, which was then to be rebuilt) cites in page 79, the opinion of Lord Coke, Horn's Mirror of Justice, &c. against this oppression; and adds afterwards, "The learned editor of Hale's History of the pleas of the crown likewise declares, that fetters ought not to be used, unless there is just reason to fear an escape, as where the prisoner is unruly, or makes an attempt to that purpose; otherwise, notwithstanding the common practice of gaolers, it seems altogether unwarrantable, and contrary to the mildness and humanity of the laws of England, by which gaolers are forbid to put their prisoners to any pain or torment."

The Gentlemen of the Gaol-committee, who distinguished themselves by an accurate and zealous inquiry into the abuses practised by gaolers*; in their Report concerning the Fleet prison, 20th March 1728, after mentioning a petition presented to the judges by one who had been put in irons by the wardens, informs us, that the judges reprimanded the wardens, and declared, that "a gaoler could not answer the ironing of a man before he was found guilty of a crime." — To the plea which gaolers use in defence of this practice, that "It is necessary for safe custody," an answer may be given in the words of lord chief justice King (afterwards lord chancellor) to the wardens of the same prison, when he forbade dungeons, which they had made use of. That judge declared, "they might raise their walls higher, &c." See the Report of the same Committee. To what lord King suggested of raising the walls, one might presume to add — The number of turnkeys should be increased in proportion to the number of prisoners. — If the daring character of our felons should seem, after all, to make it necessary to confine them in irons, it would be right, at least, to bring them into court without irons, unless they have escaped, or attempted it before their trial†.

Sect. II. BAD CUSTOMS. 15

The Marquis Beccaria, in his Essay on Crimes and Punishments, page 75, observes that "Imprisonment, being only the means of securing the person of the accused, until he be tried — ought — to be attended with as little severity as possible." — The distress occasioned by chains is increased by

[Varying Towns.]

Varying the towns where quarter-sessions and assizes are held: so that prisoners have to walk in irons ten or fifteen miles to their trial: and sometimes to towns that have no prison; where numbers of both sexes are shut up together for many days and nights in one room. This occasions such confusion and distress, and such shrieks and outcries, as can be better conceived than described. Surely prisoners ought to be conveyed in carts; or else committed at first to the town where the sessions or assizes are to be held. And in that town a proper prison ought to be built.

[Gaol Delivery.]

Gaol-delivery is in some counties but once a year. What reparation can be made to a poor creature for the misery he has suffered, and the corruption of his morals, by confinement in a prison near twelve months before a trial, in which, perhaps he is at last declared by his country not guilty?

The judicious Marquis, whom I quoted above, asserts, that "Privation of liberty" being a punishment, ought not to be inflicted before condemnation, but for as "short a time as possible." And in cases of guilt, his doctrine is, "The more immediately after the commission of a crime, a punishment is inflicted, the more just and useful it will be." This sentiment is illustrated by a variety of acute remarks in the chapter of the Advantage of immediate Punishment. My mind reverts to an admirable thought of Mr. Eden's; Principles of Penal Law, page 330. "A very slight reflection, on the numberless unforeseen events which a day may bring forth, will be sufficient to shew that we are all liable to the imputation of guilt; and consequently all interested, not only in the protection of innocence, but in the assignment to every particular offence, of the smallest punishment compatible with the safety of society."

One cause of gaol-delivery being so seldom, is in some places the expence of entertaining the judges and their retinue. At Hull they used to have the assize but once in seven years. Peacock a murderer was in prison there near three years: before his trial the principal witness died; and the murderer was acquitted. They now have it once in three years.

[ Clerks of Assize, &c.]

Although acquitted prisoners are by the late act in their favour* cleared of gaolers fees; they are still subject to a similar demand made by Clerks of assize and Clerks of the peace†; and detained in prison several days after their acquittal. At assize,

* 14th George III.

16 BAD CUSTOMS.

till the judges: at quarter-sessions, till the justices of peace leave the town; in order to obtain those fees, which the gentlemen say are not cancelled by the act. And yet the express words of it are. Acquitted prisoners "shall be immediately set at large in open court." It is evident then, that all fees of the commitment in respect to the prisoner, are by this act totally abolished.

Since the said act, the clerks of assize in some circuits have started a new demand upon the gaoler, for the judge's certificate of acquitment viz. six shillings and eight pence for the first prisoner acquitted; and a shilling for each of the rest: or two shillings for every one. I have copies of two receipts given by the clerk of the Western circuit to the gaolers of Exeter and Salisbury. One of them is as follows: "Received 1 April 1775 of Mr. Sherry gaoler one pound eight shillings and eight pence for his certificate entitling him to his gaol fees for the county of Devon per J. F**** Clerk of the Assize." — The gaoler told me this was for twenty-three acquitted prisoners.

I was informed at Durham, that judge Gould, at the assize 1775, laid a fine of fifty pounds on the gaoler for detaining some acquitted prisoners, for the fees of the clerk of assize. But upon the intercession of the Bishop (proprietor of the gaol) the fine was remitted; and the prisoners set at large: the judge ordering the clerk of assize to explain to him in London the foundation of his demand.

One pretence for detaining acquitted prisoners is, that "It is possible other indictments may be laid against them before the judge leaves the town." I call it a pretence, as the grand jury are often dismissed some days before that time, and because those who do satisfy the demands of the clerk of assize are immediately discharged. Another pretence is, the gaoler tells you "he takes them back to knock off their irons." But this may be done in court: in London they have an engine or block, by the help of which they take off the irons with ease in a minute; the machine is brought into court, and the acquitted prisoner is immediately discharged. If, according to what I proposed, prisoners were tried out of irons, this pretext would be entirely removed.

Clerks of assize, and of the peace, ought most certainly to have a consideration for their service to the public: the thing I complain of is what I am led to by my subject, that is, the demand that is made directly or indirectly upon acquitted prisoners*.

* The clerks of assize give to the judges large sums for their places. One of the present gentlemen gave for his place £2500. On many accounts these places ought not to be bought of the judges. If they were only presented, the fees might be much lower. — The demand from the gaoler for a copy of the judge's calendar is now £1: 1: 0: whereas his Majesty's Commissioners for inquiring into the officers and their fees, &c. in the Home Circuit, were of opinion that a demand not near so much was enormous, as we see in their report, dated 1st December 1735 (MS. page 21;)

"Paid by the gaoler of the County of Surry for the copy of a calendar - £0 7 6

"And by the gaoler of each of the other countys - 0 5 0

"As to these two last Fees or articles. We are of opinion that they are unreasonable and no ways to be justified, &c."

Sect. II. NUMBER OF PRISONERS. 17

[Gaolers Non-resident.]

Some gaolers live distant from the prison, in houses that do not belong to the county. Non-residence is not consistent with the attention that is requisite for securing the prisoners; and preserving good order, cleanliness, &c. — Over the door of some of the houses of these keepers is wrote, "Spirituous liquors sold here."

[Wives and Children,]

Debtors crowd the gaols (especially those in London) with their Wives and children. There are often by this means, ten or twelve people in a middle-sized room; increasing the danger of infection, and corrupting the morals of children. This point ought (no doubt) to be treated with tenderness. Man and wife should not be totally separated; but no women, unless prisoners, should ever be permitted to continue so much as one night in any prison; except, perhaps, when their husbands are dangerously ill. Yet the little probability there is of an industrious woman being of much service to her family in a prison: the number of men in the same room; and of lewd women admitted under the name of wives; prove that this affair needs some regulation.

[Gaols Private Property.]

Some gaols are private property: in these the keepers, protected by the proprietors, and not so subject as other gaolers to the controul of magistrates, are more apt to abuse their prisoners, when a temptation offers. One of these gaols some years ago was quite out of repair, and unsafe; and the proprietor not choosing to repair it, the gaoler to confine his prisoners took a method, that was really shocking*. Some years before that, a prisoner in another of these gaols was tormented with thumb-screws. The grand jury took up the case, and remonstrated to the proprietor; but in vain. I had the account from a worthy friend of mine, who was upon that very jury†.

Of the complaints, which I have hitherto made only in general terms, I shall give instances in the account of particular prisons. To that account I refer, for evidence and fact.

NUMBER OF PRISONERS.

In the spring 1776, I summed up carefully the total number of prisoners in the sundry prisons. My list was as follows:

Debtors. - Felons &c. - Petty Offenders. - Total.

1. In Middlesex, i.e. London and Westminster; together with three prisons in Southwark, viz. the King's Bench, Marshalsea, and Borough-compter, - 1274 - 228 - 194 - 1696

2. In the other thirty-nine counties of England, - 752 - 617 - 459 - 1828

3. In the twelve counties of Wales, - 67 - 27 - 0 - 94

4. In city and town-gaols, - 344 - 122 - 0 - 466

2437 - 994 - 653 - 4084

* See account of Ely gaol.

† Durham.

18 NUMBER OF PRISONERS.

Petty offenders in the Welsh county gaols, blank in the third column third line, are included in the preceding number of felons, &c. 27: most of the gaols in those counties being also the county bridewells.

Petty offenders, blank in third column fourth line, are included in the number 459 of petty offenders in the thirty-nine county gaols; and in the number 122 second column, fourth line.

All that were in the county-gaols besides debtors, I have reckoned in the list of felons, &c. although many were petty offenders and fines.

In the third column, under petty offenders are included a few felons occasionally committed to bridewells.

I have found by carefully examining sundry gaols, that, upon an average, two dependants (by which I mean wives and children*) may be assigned to each man in prison. My computation is confirmed by the account which we have from the benevolent society at the Thatched-house, March 27, 1782, as follows. Since their institution in 1772,

Discharged debtors, - 7196

who had wives, - 4328

and children, - 13126

Persons immediately benefited, - 24650.

We have farther confirmation by the account from the Bristol society; who in their list published May 31, 1775, have

Persons discharged, - 73

who had wives, - 45

and children, - 120

Total 238.

And I find by the account of the society for the discharge of persons imprisoned for small debts in Dublin, that a greater number of dependants are there assigned. For the number of persons discharged by the society from the institution on the 15th of May 1775, to May 1782, was - 1134

Dependants on them, - 3611

Total relieved - 4745.

Each of these totals is considerably larger than the respective products of multiplication by my rule: the first exceeds by 3062, the second by 19, and the last by 1343. — There is indeed commonly a surplus among debtors; but a deficiency among felons, &c. reduces the average of dependants to that which I stated.

* I do not include parents, many of whom I have seen sorrowfully attending at prisons, and deeply sharing in the distress arising from the confinement of their children.

Sect. III. PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS. 19

If then to the total number in England and Wales, that is, - 4084

You add twice that number of dependants, - 8168

The number of the distressed is, - 12252.

It appears from the foregoing table of prisoners, that their number has been greatly magnified by conjectural computations; but surely the real numbers, with those partaking of their distress, is an object worthy the farther attention of the legislature.

It may afford some satisfaction to my readers, to see at one view the number of prisoners in the counties of England and Wales, in 1779, and 1782. A table for this purpose shall be inserted at the end of the book.

SECTION III.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS

IN THE STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT

OF PRISONS.

HOWEVER sanguinary the wish of an angry creditor maybe when he arrests and imprisons his debtor; there is no doubt but every one who listens, not to his passions but to reason, must know and will own, that it is a flagrant crime to take away the life of a man for debt. And as to felony, a gaol is not designed for the final punishment even of that; but for the safe custody of the accused to the time of trial, and of convicts till a legal sentence be executed upon them. "Humane treatment debtors have a claim to; nor can we confidently with any good principle, either of morals or government, refuse the same to persons accused, or even to the most atrocious convicts." Principles of Penal Law, page 52. The

20 PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.

laws of England do not suffer private executions. No condemned malefactor may be secretly put to death; nor murdered in a prison directly or indirectly; much less ought those to be destroyed there whose sentence does not affect their life. Their destruction is not only unjust; it is inconsistent with prudence and sound policy. They might, no doubt, be useful at home or abroad; if proper care were taken of them in prison, to keep them healthy and fit for labour. But certain it is, that many of those who survive their long confinement, are by it rendered incapable of working. Some of them by scorbutic distempers; others by their toes mortified, or quite rotted from their feet; many instances of which I have seen. Messrs. Stephenson and Randolf of Bristol, great contractors for transport convicts, complained of this to Mr. Biggs, gaoler at Salisbury, in their letter to him Sept. 13, 1774. I will transcribe their words. "Sore feet prove very fatal. The mortality we met with in our last of ship, if repeated in this, will so surfeit us, that we shall never take another. We lost an immense sum by them; and our ship is detained to this moment under quarantine."

If one who has turned king's evidence, or has been barely acquitted upon trial; terrified by his narrow escape, seeks for honest employment; he is commonly such a sickly miserable figure, that no one will set him to work. That, I believe, is the principal cause of his being rejected; for there are several aorts of labour that require but little confidence: yet the poor acquitted prisoner shall go from door to door asking for work, in vain. Is it not to be lamented, that every spark of good intention, instead of being cherished, should be thus extinguished? and that the penitent should by an almost irresistible necessity be driven again, though reluctant, to the practice which soon brings him back to his former mansion; and shortens a wretched life, that might have been, that fain would have been, an useful one

In order to redress these various evils, the first thing to be taken into consideration is the prison itself. Many county-gaols and other prisons are so decayed and ruinous, or, for other reasons, so totally unfit for the purpose, that new ones must be built in their stead. Others are very incommodious, but may be improved upon the ground about them, which is occupied by the keeper, or not used at all. Some need little more than a thorough repair. In order to give what little assistance I can to those who must build a new county gaol, I will take the liberty to suggest what hath occurred to me upon this head, in hopes that some more skilful hand will undertake the generous and benevolent talk of carrying to perfection a scheme, of which I can only draw the outlines. But first I will say a word of the

[Plate.]

Sect. III. PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS. 21

SITUATION.

A County Gaol, and indeed every prison, should be built on a spot that is airy, and if possible near a river, or brook. I have commonly found prisons situated near a river, the cleanest and most healthy. They generally have not (they could not well have) subterraneous dungeons, which have been so fatal to thousands: and by their nearness to running water, another evil, almost as noxious, is prevented, that is the stench of sewers.

I said a gaol should be near a stream; but I must annex this caution; that it be not so near as that either the house or yard shall be within the reach of floods. This circumstance was so little thought of at Appleby in Westmorland, when their new gaol was first building, that I saw the walls marked from nine inches to three feet high by floods.

If it be not practicable to build near a stream, then an eminence should be chosen: for as the walls round a prison must be so high as greatly to obstruct a free circulation of air, this inconvenience should be lessened by a rising ground: and the prison should not be surrounded by other buildings, nor built in the middle of a town or city.

PLAN.

THE annexed engraving represents such a plan for a prison as, according to my ideas, unites the greatest advantages with regard to security, health, and order. By the assistance of the references, it will explain itself better than can be done by a verbal description. I shall only subjoin a few general remarks on some particulars in the structure.

[Arcades.]

That part of the building which is detached from the walls, and contains the men-felons ward, may be square, or rectangular, raised on Arcades, that it may be more airy, and leave under it a dry walk in wet weather. These wards over arcades are also best for safety, for I have found that escapes have been most commonly effected by undermining cells and dungeons. When I went into Horsham gaol with the keeper, we saw a heap of stones and rubbish. The felons had been for two or three days undermining the foundation of their room; and a general escape was intended that night. We were but just in time to prevent it; for it was almost night when we went in. Our lives were at their mercy: but (thank God) they did not attempt to murder us, and rush out. — If felons should find any other means to break out of this raised ward, they will still be stopped by the wall of the court, which is the principal security; and the

22 PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.

walls of the wards need not then be of that great thickness they are generally built, whereby the access of light and air is impeded. Every room should be vaulted; for I have known many poor creatures burnt to death, as at Halstead, &c. who would have been saved if such a precaution had been used. The staircases of all prisons should be stone.

[Small Rooms.]

I wish to have so many small rooms or cabins that each criminal may sleep alone. These rooms to be ten feet high to the crown of the arch, and have double doors, one of them iron-latticed, for the circulation of air. If it be difficult to prevent their being together in the day-time: they should by all means be separated at night*. Solitude and silence are favourable to reflection; and may possibly lead them to repentance. Privacy and hours of thoughtfulness are necessary for those who must soon leave the world; (yet how contrary to this is our practice! Keepers have assured me, that they have made £5 a day after the condemnation of their prisoners.) — In the Old Newgate there were fifteen cells for persons in this situation, which are still left standing, and are annexed to the new building. The like provision for such as return to society cannot be less needful. Bishop Butler, one of the writers cited in the note, affirms that it is much more so, "since it must be acknowledged, of greater consequence in a religious, as well as civil respect, how persons live than how they die."

The separation I am pleading for, especially at night, would prevent escapes, or make them very difficult: for that is the time in which they are generally planned, and effected. This also would prevent their robbing one another in the night. Another reason for separation is, that it would free gaolers from a difficulty of which I have heard them complain:

[King's Evidence.]

they hardly know where to keep criminals admitted to be evidence for the king: these would be murdered by their accomplices if put among them; and in more than one prison, I have seen them, for that reason, put in the women's ward.

Where there are opposite windows they should have shutters; but these should be open all day. In the men-felons ward the windows should be six feet from the floor; there should be no glass; nor should the prisoners be allowed to stop them with straw, &c.

[Women-Felons.]

The Women felons ward should be quite distinct from that of the men†; and the young criminals from old and hardened offenders. Each of these three classes should

* See the importance of this separation strongly urged in a Letter to Sir Robert Ladbroke, printed for Oliver, 1771. — See also a Spital Sermon of bishop Butler, preached before the magistrates of London, April 14th, 1750, particularly page 20, &c. And Mr. Hanway's. 8th, 10th, and 22d Letters in his book entitled The Defects of Police the Cause of Immorality, &c.

† By an act made in Ireland, 3d of his present Majesty, it is enacted, "That in all gaols hereafter to be built, there may be distinct apartments for the men and women; and that all gaolers, whose gaols will at present admit of such a distinction, may be obliged to separate and keep apart the different sexes."

Sect. III. PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS. 23

also have their day-room or kitchen with afire-place; and their court and offices all separate.

[Pump.]

Every court should be paved with flags or flat stones for the more convenient washing it; and have a good Pump, or water laid in; both if possible: and the pump and pipes should be repaired as soon as they need it; otherwise the gaols will soon be offensive and unwholesome: as I have always found them to be in such cases. A small stream constantly running in the court is very desirable.

[Bath.]

In a room or shed near the pump or pipe, there should be a commodious Bath* with steps (as there is in some county hospitals) to wash prisoners that come in dirty, and to induce them afterwards to the frequent use of it†. It should be filled every morning, and let off in the evening through the sewers into the drains. There should also be a copper in the shed, to heat a quantity of water sufficient to warm that in the bath; for washing those that are sickly.

[Oven.]

There should likewise be an Oven: nothing so effectually destroys vermin in clothes and bedding, nor purifies them so thoroughly when tainted with infection, as being a few hours in an oven moderately heated‡.

[Infirmary.]

The Infirmary or sick wards should be in the most airy part of the court, quite detached from the rest of the gaol, and raised on arcades. These rooms should never be without crib-beds and bedding. In the middle of the floor of each room there should be a grate of twelve or fourteen inches square, for a current of air‖; covered with a shutter or hatch at night. The same contrivance might also be convenient in the other wards.

[Ventilators.]

Besides the grate, it may be necessary to have in the wards of the infirmary, hand-ventilators to freshen them every day. This machine is of excellent use when most wanted, and when the wind or sail-ventilator is of no service, that is, in calm weather. Dr. Hales (on the subject, page 12) shews that it will supply seventy-five tons of air in a minute. But on farther observation, I am persuaded that ventilators are of little use in those gaols, where there are no dungeons; for if they have courts, and the rooms are a proper size, and have apertures, and are kept clean; and also lime-whited twice a year, there will be no danger of infectious disorders.

* 14th George III. Cap. XLIII.

† I might mention as an evidence of the advantage of Baths in prisons, that I have known instances where persons supposed to be dead of the gaol-fever, and brought out for burial; on being washed with cold water, have shewn signs of life, and soon after recovered. Even persons with the small-pox have found advantage by the cold bath. See some remarkable instances in the appendix to Dr. Watson's Account of a Series of Experiments.

‡ See Dr. Lind's Essay on the Health of Seamen, p. 320 and 336.

‖ Dr. Lettsom's successful method has proved the benefit of fresh air in putrid fevers. Sec his Medical Memoirs, p. 19, 57, 58, 62, &c. A putrid fever was lately in the poor-house at Yarmouth, but by the airiness of the situation was so mild, that many of the patients walked out with the spots on them.

24 PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.

The sewers or vaults of all prisons should be in the courts, and not in the passages, and (like those in the colleges) close boarded between the seats up to the ceiling, the boards projecting ten inches before each seat.

The infirmary and sheds will not render the court unsafe, provided the walls have parapets, or small chevaux de frise.

[Separation of Debtors and Felons.]

Debtors and felons should have wards totally separate: the peace, the cleanliness, the health and morals of debtors cannot be secured otherwise. The act 22d and 23d Charles II. Chapter XX. requires this separation at night; that debtors may not be disturbed by the curses and other profane language of felons: "Be it enacted, — That they shall be put, kept, and lodged separate and apart one from another, in distinct rooms." These words do perhaps in the strict construction imply no more than nocturnal separation. But surely it is a far greater mischief for debtors to be annoyed and corrupted by the wicked conversation of felons all day long, than to be disturbed by it in the night-time. I am not designing to infer from hence, nor yet from the character of the Gentlemen who composed that parliament, that the act should be construed according to my view of the argument; or to what I conjecture was their intention. I know it is wrong to explain laws by such a vague principle as the supposed spirit of them. But it seems to me necessary that there should be a total separation: for where there is but one court, the lower class of debtors join with the felons in their diversions of fives, &c. and often become equally profligate: as at Worcester, Glocester, Salisbury, Aylesbury, Bedford, Ipswich, Bury, Leicester, &c. These different sorts of prisoners are indeed generally separated at night. I do not recollect more than one or two gaols where they lodge together, viz. the Borough-compter, Clerkenwell bridewell, the Devizes and St. Albans. I must now add Tothillfields bridewell, where debtors are confined, since Westminster gatehouse is taken down. Constant separation is desirable. The gaol will by that means be kept cleaner: and if the small-pox, or the gaol-fever, should infect one ward, the other at a distance may be free from it. This would also remove the objection that is now made against permitting debtors to work: that is, the danger of their furnishing felons with tools for mischief, or escape.

[Workshop.]

In the debtors ward there should be a day-room or kitchen; also a large work-shop for such as are willing to work. Some few gaols have the latter; and in them I have seen basket-makers, shoe-makers, &c. employed in their several trades; preserving their habit of industry; contributing to the support of their families, and lightening the burthen that by their imprisonment falls on the respective parishes. Here I would observe, that wherever the windows are glazed there should be casements; for I have found the debtors rooms, and passages of many town and city gaols, very offensive for want of apertures.

Prisoners indicted for felony should not be compelled to work. But I have heard many of them wishing they might be permitted to earn something for their more

comfortable support. In some few gaols they have this privilege, as at Exeter, Norwich, Ipswich, &c*.

[Women-Debtors.]

I had said in my first edition, that Women-debtors should have a ward, a court, a pump, &c. to themselves; and no communication should be allowed between the two sexes: but observing. that there are so few women-debtors in prison (the number of whom may be seen in the table) I leave it to the consideration of the justices, whether a room or two in the gaoler's house may not be as convenient as a separate ward.

[Debtors Ward.]

The Ward for men-debtors should also be over arcades, and placed on one side of the gaoler's house. This house should be in or near the middle of the gaol, with windows to the felons and the debtors court. This would be a check on the prisoners to keep them in order; and would engage the gaoler to be attentive to cleanliness and constant washing, to prevent his own apartments from being offensive.

[Chapel.]

A Chapel is necessary in a gaol. I have chosen for it what seems to me a proper situation. It should have a gallery for debtors, or women; for the latter should be out of aight of all the other prisoners; and the rest may be separated below. Bibles and prayer-books should be chained at convenient distances on each side: those who tear or otherwise damage them should be punished.

REGULATIONS.

WITHOUT a due attention to the oeconomy and government of a prison, it is evident that no contrivance of structure can secure it from being the abode of wickedness, disease, and misery; I shall therefore offer a few hints for the better regulation of a gaol.

[Gaoler.]

The first care must be to find a good man for a gaoler; one that is honest, active, and humane. Such was Abel Dagge, who was formerly keeper of Bristol Newgate. I regretted his death, and revere his memory. And such is George Smith, keeper of Tothill-fields bridewell.

This officer must be sober himself, that he may, by example, as well as authority, restrain drunkenness, and other vices in his prison. To remove a strong temptation to the contrary, it is highly requisite that no gaoler, turnkey, or other servant be

* The debtors at York, Lincoln, Norwich, Ipswich, Chelmsford, &c. employ themselves in knitting and weaving purses, garters, nets, laces, &c. This is an easy and amusing employment, and might be established in any prison, even among felons. For the art may be learned in a week's time, and no dangerous instruments are necessary. But then they must have proper rooms and courts for their work.

26 PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.

[Tap.]

suffered to hold the Tap; or to have any connexion, concern, or interest whatever in the sale of liquors of any kind. Gaolers who hold, or let, the tap, find their account in not only conniving at, but promoting drunkenness and midnight revels, so that most of our gaols are riotous ale-houses and brothels. What profligate and debauched company of both sexes, do we see let into our gaols, that the tap may be kept running! Even condemned criminals are sometimes heated with liquor till they become outrageous, as Lewis was, who was executed at Leicester in 1782. Besides this, the gaoler's interest in the sale of liquors, may prompt him to be partial in his behaviour to his prisoners; to treat at least with neglect, those who are poor and have nothing to spend; which is the case of far the greater number: while he shall caress dishonest debtors, who take shelter in a prison, in order to live there in riot upon the property of their creditors. I am persuaded there would be fewer debtors in prison if there were no taps, and they were restrained from riot and drunkenness.

I know that by the statute of 32d George II. a debtor has a right to send out of the gaol for liquor and other necessaries*. This is a very judicious provision; and very beneficial to prisoners, where they have the free use of it†. But some keepers there are, who find ways to restrain this privilege, for the profits of their tap: whereas if they were prohibited from all concern in the sale of liquor, this would not only remove that check, and restore to prisoners the enjoyment of the liberty they are entitled to; but would also be the means of suppressing much intemperance; and perhaps of abolishing garnish, as well as clubs or night associations.

That it is necessary to deprive gaolers of all profits arising from the tap, I am convinced, not by mere speculation, but by what I have learned from conversation with gaolers themselves. I asked two of them, whom I found candid and intelligent, "What they thought would be the most likely means of effecting a thorough reformation in gaols?" The answer I had from both, was to this purpose, "Let no licences be granted for selling beer or wine in gaols: let it be made some other way worth our while to keep them."

Gaolers should have salaries proportioned to the trust and trouble; since no office, if faithfully and humanely administered, better deserves an adequate encouragement: yet not so much as to raise them above attention to their duty, and the daily inspection of their gaols.

The Gaol-Committee, which I have mentioned before, in their report of the Marshalsea prison, 14th May 1729, after enumerating many mischiefs which they

* Wine is not necessary, therefore I could wish it were under the same restriction as spirituous liquors in all prisons.

found had been occasioned by the gaoler's holding or letting the tap, draw the following conclusion: "This shews the inconveniency of the keepers having the advantage of the tap-house, since to advance the rent thereof, and to consume the liquors there vended, they not only encourage riot and drunkenness, but also prevent the needy prisoner from being supplied by his friends with the meer necessaries of life, in order to increase an exorbitant gain to their tenants."

When I was in Ireland (January 1775) I found not without some surprise, that no liquors were permitted to be sold by gaolers in any of the prisons which I then visited. Upon inquiry, I learned that there is an act against it, made in the third year of his present Majesty*.

No prisoner should be a turnkey. — It is the gaoler's duty to inspect the wards himself every day, that he may see they are clean, and not to leave this to servants†. He should open and unstop the windows, and order the bedding out to be aired, and the cribs, to be taken out and washed, otherwise they will gather dirt, and answer no salutary end. The magistrates of Glasgow‡ have expressly ordered that "The gaoler every morning and evening, at the opening of, and before the shutting up the prison, shall personally visit every room and place therein."

He must encourage and promote cleanliness. For this reason an old or infirm man should not be a gaoler: when that is the case, all is commonly dirty. — He should be compassionate to the sick. — If he distributes the allowance, he must do justice to the county, or city, and to his prisoners, by giving to the latter their full stated quantity.

I have, said before, a gaoler should not live at a distance from his prison∥. He should not only reside on the spot, but be constantly at home. Prisoners generally take advantage of his absence. — For this reason, no keeper of a prison should be a

* The preamble runs thus, "Whereas-many frauds and abuses have been committed by gaolers — exacting exorbitant fees, brewing of drink, and baking of bread, which they oblige their prisoners to take from them at their own rates — Be it enacted — that no gaoler, or any person in trust for him, shall brew or bake in the gaol — or in any place — for sale, or keep any shop for the selling of bread, or beer, or ale, or other liquors, under the penalty of five pounds for every such offence."

† In my first journies many county gaolers excused themselves from going with me into the felons ward. In York castle (in 1774) the felons told me once and again that the gaoler had not been in their ward for months. I would not have quoted a report from felons, if the turnkey, who was present, had not confirmed their testimony.

‡ I ought not here to omit my grateful acknowledgments of the politeness and civility of these Gentlemen, who, on my visit to the place in January 1775, did me the honour of presenting me with the freedom of the city, in a manner truly hospitable and obliging.

∥ The bad consequences of a contrary police I have often seen and lamented; particularly at Dublin in the old and new gaol.

28 PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.

[Sheriff's Officer.]

Sheriff's officer. Such are very often abroad: and some of them have acknowledged to me, that their business as officers was incompatible with their duty as gaolers.

[Chaplain.]

I had the pleasure to find a Chaplain appointed to most of the county gaols; in consequence of the act made the 13th of his present Majesty. When this office is vacant, it behoves magistrates not to take the first clergyman who offers his service, without regarding his real character. They should choose one who is in principle a Christian: who will not content himself with officiating in public; but will converse with the prisoners; admonish the profligate; exhort the thoughtless; comfort the sick; and make known to the condemned, that mercy which is revealed in the Gospel.

In the Life of Bernard Gilpin, page 173, the writer, speaking of his labours, informs us, that "wherever he came, he used to visit all the jails and places of confinement; few in the kingdom having at that time any appointed minister." And by his affectionate address "he is said to have reformed many very abandoned persons in those places*."

In some prisons where there is a chaplain appointed, no worship is fixed for Sunday: in some where that day is fixed, the chaplain, choosing his hours, comes sometimes too soon in the morning, sometimes between morning and evening service, at the prisoners dinner-time. In some there is no fixed day at all; consequently (as I have too often found) the service is totally omitted. — It would be proper to have sermon and prayers once, at least, on the Lord's day†: and prayers two fixed days in the week besides. And if a chapter of the New Testament were read daily by one of the prisoners to the rest, or by the gaoler, before the distribution of prison allowance, the time would not be mispent. The reader, if a prisoner, might be allowed a small weekly pension. — The gaoler should not, as some do, hinder any prisoner from attending divine service. He ought to remove every hindrance. And, on Sunday especially, no visitants should be admitted during that time. Visitants who are there, should go out or attend. The chapel bell should ring ten minutes before divine service. Upon asking at more places than one, "Why there were so few prisoners at prayers?" I have been answered, "They are drinking with their friends." I have heard some worthy clergymen lament the little success attending their labours in prisons, which they attributed to the sale of liquors, and the want of a proper separation of the sexes. The gaoler should be constant at chapel with

* In the reign of Queen Mary, this faithful minister of the Gospel was to have been a sacrifice. But in his journey from Durham to London, where he expected to suffer, his leg was broken by a fall from his horse; and by that circumstance Providence saved him from the fiery trial; for the bigotted Queen died before his recovery. In the next reign he was promoted to the rich living of Houghton in Northumberland: and it was there he laboured, as is said above.

† For on Sundays I have often seen debtors and others lying on their beds in the day-time; which I am persuaded would not have been the case, if there had been divine service in the chapel.

his prisoners; and set a good example for them to follow. The chaplain who officiates in the gaol may also officiate at the bridewell, where the distance will allow; and preach once a Sunday in each prison*.

It perhaps will be said, that I propose a great deal of duty to these gentlemen. The act just recited allows a sum not exceeding fifty pounds a year for their services. Many counties have fixed that salary; but I should hope that clergymen might be found who would act from a much nobler motive, a regard to the most important interests of their fellow-creatures.

[Surgeon.]

The late act for preserving the health of prisoners requires that an experienced Surgeon or Apothecary be appointed to every gaol: a man of repute in his profession. His business is, in the first place, to order the immediate removal of the sick, to the infirmary; and see that they have proper bedding and attendance. Their irons should be taken off; and they should have, not only medicines, but also diet suitable to their condition. He must diligently and daily visit them himself; not leaving them to journeymen and apprentices. He should constantly inculcate the necessity of cleanliness and fresh air; and the danger of crowding prisoners together: and he should recommend, what he cannot enforce. I need not add, that according to the act, he must report to the justices at each quarter-sessions, a state of the health of the prisoners under his care†.

At Newgate there are commonly about two hundred prisoners. Here the danger to them, and to the City from them, is great. To this capital prison in the metropolis, the magistrates would, in my opinion, do well to appoint a physician, a surgeon and apothecary. One of the two latter to visit each ward in the prison every day. The two Compters are near enough to be taken care of by the same gentlemen; and they need to be visited as constantly. This attention would, in all probability, prevent the spread of any infectious disease in those gaols; and silence county gaolers, who, when their prisons are infected, tell you (as I have often heard them) "The distemper was brought from Newgate, by prisoners removed from thence by habeas corpus."

[Fees.]

No prisoner should be subject to any demand of Fees. The gaoler should have a salary in lieu of them: and so should the turnkeys; their wages should not be included in the gaoler's salary: and not only their pay, but the number of them

* In the book of Common Prayer in Ireland, there is very properly inserted, "A form of prayer for the visitation of prisoners, treated upon by the Archbishops and Bishops, and the rest of the clergy of Ireland, and agreed upon by her majesty's license in their synod, holden at Dublin, in the year 1711."

† In some foreign countries an officer of rank is obliged frequently to visit the prisons, with a surgeon. He has a list of the prisoners, and sees each of them, and makes a report to the regency of their health, and the care that is taken of them.

30 PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS.

necessary for each prison, should be determined by the magistrates. Neither of those articles should be left to the interested appointment of a gaoler. If fees be not abolished, I am sure they should be reduced; and so should the chamber-rents for master-side debtors. In this matter (of the chambers) another regulation is also needful; that is, no middle-sized room should have more beds than two. The bedding and other furniture should be specified as to articles and value.

[Free Ward.]

For common-side debtors there should be a ward entirely free: they should not be subject to any demand of rent; as in many prisons they are. These prisoners should either be alimented by their creditors without expence and delay; or have from the county the same allowance of every kind as felons: food, bedding, and medicine.

[Cleanliness.]
---
In order to Cleanliness; than which scarce any thing in the whole ceconomy of a gaol is of more importance, the ceiling and walls of every ward and room should be well scraped; and then washed with the belt stone-lime taken hot from the kiln, and flaked in boiling water and lize, and used during the strong effervefcence *; at least twice a year; just after the Lent and Summer assize. Each ward and room should be swept, and washed every day3 by the respective inhabitants; and sometimes with hot vinegar. Idle gaolers affect to excuse their negligence in this respect, by pretending that daily washing would make the rooms damp, and endanger the health of prisoners. This is mere pretence. I know the effect is directly contrary. There is not in England a prison more healthy, considering the number of prisoners, than Tothillfields bridewell; where the rooms are washed every day. The prisoners do the work by turns: and the healthiness of the prison is a demonstration, that no inconvenience, but great benefit is the consequence In Newgate, the prisoner who sweeps the ward has a double allowance

* This is called lime-white, although whiting is not an ingredient in it. Nothing is more effectual to destroy vermin, purify the air, and prevent infection. White-washing is not only proper for cleanliness, but attempts to escape are more easily discovered in white than in dirty walls.

f From the general practice of foreigners in building their prisons near the water, it seems, that they had no apprehensions of bad conferences arising from such a situation; but they were convinced of the necessity of cleanliness, and of the bad effects of offensive drains. Dr. Heberden has expressed his sentiments on this subject in the Medical Transactions, pages 521, 524. "In England few make any doubt of the great danger attending wet rooms. — Is this opinion founded upon experience, or is it a prejudice, which has been suffered to grow up and get strength merely for want of being examined? If we inquire into the arguments in favour of this notion, we shall hardly find any other, than the random conjectures of the sick about the cause of their illness; or than their artfully substituting this origin of it in (lead of some other, which they are unwilling to own. — The air from rivers and from the sea is«probably more replenished with vapours, than inland countries cleared of their woods; yet the most celebrated of antient physicians recommended the bank of a running river for the situation of a house, on " account of its peculiar healthiness; and many invalids are sent by the modern physicians to the sea side, only for the benefit of the sea air."

of bread. — Every prisoner should be obliged to wash his hands and face before hfc comes for his daily allowance; and to keep himself as neat as circumstances will admit. I have said -before, there should be plenty of water in a prison; and need not add now, that prisoners should constantly have free and easy access to it. Nothing can be more unreasonable than the pretences used among us to justify inattention and negligence. I cannot help taking this occasion to add the following authorities on this subject. All unprejudiced persons must acknowledge the absolute necessity of fresh air and cleanliness to preserve and promote health. To this purpose Dr. Mead writes, in his Discourse concerning Pestilential Contagion, page 41, &c. 3d edit. 1720. " Nothing approaches so near to the first original of contagion, as air pent up,

" loaded with damps, and corrupted with the fikhiness that proceeds from animal " bodies. Our common prisons afford us an instance of this, in which very few " escape, what they call the gaol-fetter, which is always attended with a degree of " malignity in proportion to the closeness and stench of the place. And it would certainly very well become the wisdom of the government, as well with regard to the " health of the town, as in compassion to the prisoners, to take care, that all houses of " confinement, should be kept as airy and clean, as is confident with the use, to which they are designed."--- And that " as nastiness is a great source of insession, so cleanliness is the greatest prefer vat ive."

Sir John Pringle, in his Anniversary Discourse at the Royal Society, on the subject of Captain Cook's successful care of the Chip's crew in his voyage round the world, and the medal deservedly adjudged to him on that account, has the following passage at page 26. " It is well known how much 'cleanliness is conducive to health; but it is not

" so obvious how much it also tends to good order and other virtues. That diligent " officer was persuaded — that such men as he could induce to be more cleanly than " they were disposed to be of themselves, became at the same time more sober, more " orderly, and more attentive to their duty." This remark is confirmed by an observation in the Spectator, No. 631. " Several vices, destructive both to mind

" and body, are inconsistent with the habit of cleanliness."

Every prisoner who comes to gaol dirty, should be washed in the cold or warm bath; and his clothes should be put into the oven, in a sack on a pair of iron dogs. He should be provided with coarse washing clothes to wear while his own are thus purifying: clothes should be kept ready in the gaol for this purpose *. Each prisoner should have a clean shirt twice a week. There should be in each ward a towel on a roller clean every day. Pails, mops, brooms, soap, vinegar, and fuel, shoulcL

It would be better if criminals were to wear a kind of prison-uniform during the whole of their confinement, as I have seen practised at many foreign prisons. Among other good effects, this would make them more liable to be discovered on escaping. On the other hand, they should be tried in their own clothes, for the obvious reason that they may be more easily recognized by the witnesses.

be supplied by the county or town: otherwise gaols will never be kept clean and wholesome*.

No stable, hogcote or dunghill should be suffered in the court f; nor any fowls kept there, which I have often seen not only in the courts, but also in the rooms of many prisons. No gaoler should keep more than one dog, and none should be kept by any prisoner whatever. Sweepings, ashes, See. should be taken away twice Bedding. a week. If the Bedding is draw, it (laould be put in coarse canvass; if it is not so enclosed, it ought to be changed every week. Each bed should have a blanket and coarse coverlet, and not be laid on the floor, but on a crib-bedstead, which should be moveable for washing the room. This would prevent infection by cutaneous disorders, which are common in prisons. — Sir John Pringle obferves, page 51, " There being no draw at Fort-Augustus, the men were ordered to cut the heath for " bedding; and it was observable, that such as were most careful in providing " themselves with a due quantity, and renewing it osten, were lead sickly." May

As fumigation may sometimes be necessary in the rooms of prisons, I here give some extracts from the account with which the ingenious Dr. Lind favoured me, of his successful method of purifying infefted* ships. "Charcoal fires should be lighted in the morning, and allowed to remain till evening, and half a pound of brimstone thrown upon each; their smoke in the mean time being closely confined. They may be made in iron pots. This fumigation should be repeated every day for a fortnight. Every evening after the fumigation, the ports and hatchways should be opened, and the inside of the ship washed with warm vinegar: and after the last fumigation, before the men return to the ship, the decks should be thoroughly scraped and cleaned. If the infection has been very violent, the parts of the ship most exposed to it may also be white-washed. Every thing ragged and dirty should be destroyed, as also the clothes and bedding of such as brought the infection into the ship, the bedding of such as have died of the fever, and unless the infection has been very mild, the bedding of such as have had the fever though recovered. The remaining clothes and bedding should be purified by being exposed twice a week to the steams of the brimstone and charcoal; or when the brimstone might be supposed to injure the clothes, they may be hung up in a dose* place — exposed to the smoke of tobacco strewed on charcoal fires. Linens, and such articles as will admit of being wet, should, after the first fumigation, be sleeped* for several hours in cold water or leys, be well washed, and then dried in the open air. If, during the fortnight of this fumigation, any person is taken ill of the fever, the fortnight should again commence from the day on which such person leaves the ship. Strict attention should be paid to the cleanliness of the men both in their persons and apparel: such as are sluggish and dirty should be made to bathe and clean themselves; and a sufficient quantity of flops should be issued, that every man may have a change of clothes."

I have observed in prisons abroad a very cheap and pleasant fumigation, which surprisingly corrects the -offensiveness of the bad air. I suppose it is the same as is used in Roman catholic churches, viz. juniper berries thrown upon burning coals in a chafing-dish.

+ The act of parliament in Ireland, which I mentioned in a former note, orders that No gaoler, or any person employed by him, shall presume on any account to keep in the said gaols, or the yard, " or the houses adjoining thereto, and provided for the use of such prisoners, any hogs, cows, or other " cattle, under the penalty of forty shillings for such hog, cow, or other beast kept in the said gaol or prison."

not one great cause of the unhealthiness of our prisoners be, the want of proper bedding, which obliges them to lie in their clothes? How different did the prisoners appear at Trieste from many that I have seen in Prussia and at Vienna! I was struck with the same good appearance of the women prisoners at several of the spin houses in Holland. This reminds me of what I heard an old general say, " That he always found his men <c subject to illness and diseases when they lay in camps, not from dampness, but from " lying in their clothes and the want of proper bedding; for at the same time all his " officers had been quite healthy and well." Whatever be the cause of this difference, whether a more free perspiration in bed, taking off bandages, or ventilation of the clothes, I am fully convinced of the fatt.

Prisoners should not remain in the day-time in the rooms in which they sleep; they should have a common ward, day-room or kitchen, and an allowance of firing. They should also be made to get up early, and be called over — to their bread — and prayers. This would divert them, prevent them from sleeping immoderately, and be conducive to health. The doors of all the wards should be open at six in summer, and seven in winter. — Debtors should be locked up in their rooms at ten at night, as in France and other foreign countries.

Those who drink only water, and have no nutritious liquor, ought to have at least a pound and a half of good household bread every day. The bread should be one day old, and then honestly weighed to them. If once a week (suppose on Sunday) some of the coarser pieces of beef were boiled in the copper, and half a pound of the meat without bone given to each prisoner, with a quart of the broth, this Sunday dinner might be made an encouragement to peaceable and orderly behaviour: the turbulent and refractory should not have it. Such an allowance might help to remove a bad custom that obtains too generally, the pretence of refreshing prisoners with better food and drink on Sunday; upon which many are admitted into the gaols, and keep the prisoners from chapel.

I state the allowance in weighty not money, because of the variable price. Besides that quantity of bread, each prisoner should have a penny a day in money for cheese, butter, potatoes, pease, turnips: or he should have an honed: pennyworth of one of those articles.

Here, as in the tap, I must insist upon it as highly necessary, that every gaoler, bridewell-keeper, turnkey, &c. be excluded from all concern in the prisoners allowance; from all profit arising directly or indirectly from the sale of their bread, or other food. Whoever distribu tes it, should be free from all temptation to fraud: and be subject to a strong check. Scales and weights should be in all prisons, that the prisoners may see that they have their allowance. The whole allowance of prisoners should never be given them in money. — In Ireland, the minister of the parish where the gaol is, orders the felons bread; and keeps (should keep) the account of it: for he is allowed by act of parliament, the 3d of Geo. III. Chap. XXVIII. a sum not exceeding ten pounds a year for the trouble.

The reader will plainly see, that I am not an advocate for an extravagant and prof lifer allowance to prisoners. I plead only for necessaries, in such a moderate quantity, as may support health an*"' strength for labour. The law allows the poor debtor who is detained in prison, two shillings and four pence a week*(I wish it were more easily obtained) 5 and the government allowance to assize convicts under sentence of transportation is a little more, viz. two shillings and six pence, which the sheriff* charges to government in his bill of cravings, presented at the expiration of his office. — And I believe upon the average price of bread, potatoes, See. the allowance I have mentioned does not exceed those sums. I presume it may be thought rather incongruous to allow prisoners before trial (on which some of them may be found not guilty) less than is given to those that are convicted.

No fighting should be suffered in a gaol: no quarreling, or abusive language; nor the frequent occasion of them, gaming. If any one be injured, let him complain to the keeper, who must hear both parties face to face, decide the matter, and punish the aggressor by closer confinement. Faults that deserve more severe animadversion, should be reserved for the cognizance of the magistrates, or an inspector.

Money sent, collected, or bequeathed, should be distributed by the magistrates impartially. Some of it might be laid out in tools, See. for such debtors as will work.

The mention of Legacies reminds me of the need there is of a list of them painted legibly on a board; which should be hung up so as to be read by the prisoners. Very few gaols have such a table: and for want of it many legacies have been entirely lost} and the charitable intention of the testators frustrated. Yet care of legacies is expressly required by the act 32d George II. " And it is farther enacted, that it be given in "charge to every grand jury impannelled and sworn, to make inquiry concerning the same."

In the like conspicuous manner should be hung up in every gaol an authentic ‘Table of fees, till they all are abolished. This also is expressly required by the same ad. Yet in many gaols it is totally disregarded, and they have no such table, and prisoners are exposed to the imposition of keepers.

In the act 24th George 11. which prohibits the use of spirituous liquors in prisons or work-houses, it is expressly required, that every gaoler, keeper, master, &c. shall procure one or more copies of the three clauses f which contain the several articles of the prohibition, to be printed or fairly written, and hung up in one of the most

The act for preserving the health of prisoners requires that it be painted on a board, &c. not merely written or printed on paper, because that is more perishable, and liable to be torn *. I have observed that those prisons were the cleanest in which the act was conspicuously hung up. The rules for cleanliness, and orders against garnish, gaming, drunkenness, quarreling, profaneness and obscenity, should also be visibly exhibited; with the penalties for each of those crimes. The penalties should be fixed by the magistrates, or by law. — The table should also shew the hours of opening and shutting the several wards; and of attending public worship. Besides setting down these hours in a table, notice should be given of them by a bell, as in the dock-yards. I have known prisoners absent from chapel, who said they would have been there, but did not know the service was performing.

It is expressly required by the act 32d Geo. II. that Rules and orders made, signed, and confirmed, as the table of fees, be drawn up for every prison, and hung up conspicuous in it for the inspection of prisoners f. Yet in many prisons neither tables of fees nor orders are to be seen; the latter in very few. Regulations relative to cleanliness and order, are as necessary for debtors as for felons; the want of them has often been lamented by keepers.

An Alarm bell would be extremely proper in every prison, in order to summon assistance in case of any insurrection, or general escape. The very idea of such a thing would greatly contribute to prevent the projecting of such schemes.

I have not seen the clauses hung up in any <iuork-house. I shall in the sequel mark the numerous prisons that have the same defect:I could also have mentioned prisons in which, notwithstanding the act, spirituous liquors are freely used: I could even name gaolers who find ways to evade the act, and do themselves sell such liquors to their prisoners; and I have known the clauses against spirituous liquors hung up till the keepers had licences, after which they were no more seen. — I have seen so much of the bad e Jedts of spirituous liquors, that I am persuaded a total prohibition of them would be greatly conducive to the health and morals of the community. — Dr. M‘Far I an, in his Inquiries concerning the Poor, page 30, fays, " There is no vice that has ruined a greater number of tradesmen, or brought more families to misery, than this habit of drinking spirituous liquors."

I mention this circumstance, that may seem trisling, as I know the disposition of prisoners to destroy the printed copies of the clauses against spirituous liquors.

f " Be it also enacted — That the judges and justices of assize — shall, at all assizes — make inquiry whether such table of fees, and rules and orders — are hung up and remain publick — and shall inform themselves — " and supply and redress — and shall expressly give in charge to every grand jury impannelled and sworn " before them respectively, to make inquiries concerning the same."

Inspector.

Finally; The care of a prison is too important to be left wholly to a gaoler; paid indeed for his attendance, but often tempted by his passions, or interest, to fail in his duty. To every prison there should be an Inspector appointed; either by his colleagues in the magistracy, or by parliament*. Sheriffs and magistrates have indeed this power already; and prisons are their immediate care. But some sheriffs excuse themselves from attention to this part of their duty, on account of the short duration, expence, and trouble of their office; and these gentlemen, as well as gentlemen in the commission of the peace, have no doubt been fearful of the consequence of looking into prisons. But the danger from such inspection is in great measure abated: and it may be expected that sheriffs will now engage in this business; and that among justices, and town magistrates, there may always be found one man generous enough to undertake this important service. Or if the constant trouble be thought too much for one person, it may proceed by annual, quarterly, or monthly rotation. The inspector should make his visit once in a week, changing his days. He should take with him a memorandum of all the rules, and inquire into the observance or neglect of them. He should (as is done in some of our hospitals) look into every room, to see if it be clean, &c. He should speak with every prisoner; hear all complaints; and immediately correct what he finds manifestly wrong; what he doubts of, he may refer to his brethren in office, at their next meeting. — A good gaoler will be pleased with this scrutiny; it will do him honour, and confirm him in his station; in case of a less worthy gaoler, the examination is more needful, in order to his being reprimanded; and, if he be incorrigible, he should be discharged. This honourable delegate should have no salary: he should engage from the noble motive of doing justice to prisoners, and service to his country. — The great Dr. Young fays, " If half the misery that is felt by some, were seen by others, it would shock them with horror." And the author of Yelemachui makes this delicate remark, " The prosperous turn away their eyes from the miserable, not through insensibility, but because the fight is an interruption of their gaiety." If such motives prevail with those who think themselves under no obligation to shew pity to prisoners; surely magistrates should ad upon a more righteous principle, and consider what is due from them.

I have ofen, inquired of gaolers, whether the sheriffs, justices, or town-magistrates inspect their gaols? Many of the oldest have answered, "None of those gentlemen ever looked into the dungeons, or even the wards of my gaol." Others have said, " Those gentlemen think that if they came into my gaol, they should footi be in.

The Vagrant act 17th George II. requires that two justices visit the houses of correction " twice, or oftener if need be, in every year; and to examine into the estate and management thereof, and to report, &c." And that the justices at quarter-sessions impose fines and penalties on the governors or masters who do not keep their prisoners to hard labour, and punish and correct them according to the directions of the warrants, &c.

their graves." Others, cc The justices think the inside of my house too close for them; they satisfy themselves with viewing the outside." Now if magistrates continue thus negligent of their duty, a general thorough reformation of our prisons must be despaired of What has been already obtained will soon be loft; and all will fink again into the former dreadful condition.

BRIDEWELLS.

If our bridewells be not more properly conduced, sending prisoners from them to county-gaols will defeat all the care of the most attentive gaolers, and the whole intention of the act for preserving the health of prisoners. And when offenders are discharged, they will spread disease and vice wherever they go: and instead of being amended, become an aggravated evil to society.

It is a shocking thing to destroy in prison the morals, the health, and (as is osten, done) the lives of those whom the law consigns only to hard labour and correction. — One is charged with bastardy: another is abusive in a drunken quarrel: a young creature, who perhaps was never taught a moral lesson, is guilty of some petty theft fend them to bridewell for a year, or two, which they must waste in idleness, hunger, dirt, and with companions much improved by such education. — If that prison be not secure, fend them into still worse company; that of abandoned felons in the county-gaol. What is this but devoting them to destruction ? Many may date the total loss of every principle of honour and virtue, from their confinement in these schools. of wickedness.

Every county and town that has a bridewell should be careful to fee, first of all, that it be suitable to the purpose. In many places the county-gaol is also a bridewell. But this prison ought to be quite separate from the gaol: at least not within the same walls: nor should even the court-yard be common to both. The building must be proportioned to the general number of delinquents.. None of the rooms for confinement should be lower than the ground-floor , rather a story above it. Each Work-room should have a thorough-fare for air: but the opposite windows need not be equal; the back windows half the size of those in front, and six feet from the floor *. Few or none of the windows should have glass; only bliqds, similar to what are used. in distilleries f; or shutters, and these should be open several

In all large rooms, where there are numbers of people, provision should be made for letting out the vitiated air. at the top of them. See Dr. Priestless Experiment*, &c. page 281.

WORK.

hours in the day. The rooms, where the windows are not glazed, should have fireplaces. The windows should be by no means towards the street, that spirituous liquors or files, &c. may not be conveyed to the prisoners. In the court-yard (for such is necessary in every prison *) there should be a pump, or some other provision for water in plenty. And prisoners should be permitted to walk about, when they have done working.

For in work they ought, most certainly, to be employed. This is Indispensibly requisite. Not one should be idle, that is not sick j\ Where the prisoners are numerous, there should be several work-rooms; and but few prisoners in one room. Those who work by compulsion are more likely to be seduced to idleness in large companies, than when they are more solitary. — The keeper should be a master of some manufacture £; a man of activity ||, prudence, and temper. And he should keep his prisoners at work ten hours a day; meal-times included.

For women, especially those. that have children with them, and sometimes at the breast, there should be a chimney in one or two rooms: and in winter they should be allowed firing. I have known infants starved to death for want of this §. In

By an act 7th James I. Cap. IV. it is required that there be in every county " one or more fit " and convenient house or houses of correction, with convenient backside thereunto adjoining — Every " justice of peace within every county — where such house and backside shall not be erected or provided," (within about two years) " shall forfeit for his said neglect, five pounds of lawful English " moneyone moiety to the informer, the other towards eresting, building, &c. the said house and backside — And an act made in Ireland the 10th and 11th of Charles I. requires the same, under the like penalty, for neglect.

t Many are committed to bridewell to live in idleness. Some 'warrants do not order them to labour. Magistrates should consider that prisoners confined for one or two years are entirely ruined; not only as to morals, but as to their capacity for labour; for I have known some on going to work, immediately fall into a decline.

J The acts cited in a preceding note require that houses of correction have " mills, turns, cards, and " such-like necessary implements, to set rogues or other idle persons on work." And the act 17th George II. quoted in a former note, requires that the justices at their quarter-sessions " take effectual care that the " houses of correction — be duly fitted up, furnished, and supplied with sufficient implements, materials, and " furniture, for keeping, relieying, setting to work, employing, and correcting all idle and disorderly persons, " rogues, vagabonds, &c."

|| It was remarked that a gaoler should not be an old or infirm person; the same caution is requisite with regard to the keeper of a bridewell; since such an one would neither be able to keep the prisoners properly at work, nor to prevent their making their escape at the time of locking up, as I knew to happen at Preston in Lancashire, and other places.

§ Not having sufficiently insisted on the necessity of an allowance of firing in gaols, I take occasion here to observe, that this is not only what humanity demands in our climate, but that it is essential to the preservation of the health of prisoners, by promoting the circulation of air, and preventing those mortifications of the feet to which they are so liable. I well know, that the want of firing joined to

some prisons where firing is allowed, the smoke has no vent but at the doors and windows. — There should be a separate room or two for faulty apprentices, as at Tothill-fields, Clerkenwell, St. George's Fields, &c And two airy rooms for the sick: with medical relief. Men and women should be here entirely separated, as well as in gaols, to prevent the debauchery and vice so generally practised in our prisons. They should have work-shops, as well as night-rooms, separate j\ — There should be baths, and an oven, for the same purposes as in the gaols. — In some county bridewells there are from ten to twenty prisoners, and in Tothill-fields and Clerkenwell many more. Great care should be taken to prevent infection; to keep the house clean, and well aired: and invariably to adhere to flridt rules of sobriety and diligence, in order to correct the faults of prisoners, and make them for the future useful to society. Gentle discipline is commonly more efficacious than severity; which should not be exercised but on such as will not be amended by lenity. These should be punished by solitary confinement on bread and water, for a time proportioned to their fault Endeavours should be used to persuade the offender that he is corrected only

scanty provision, has been the cause of great mortality in our prisons during the winter. In one of theft houses three prisoners were starved to death, only one halfpenny being' found on them all. I waited on the coroner (who from the humanity of our laws must be applied to in such a case) and he acquainted me, that the verdict. brought in was by the visitation of God, otherwise, the keeper would have been liable to a prosecution for felony, and might have been hanged; whereas, the fault lay with the justices, who had ordered an allowance not sufficient to support nature.

Boys confined for correction should always be separate from other prisoners, and indeed from one another. A kind and tender monitor should often see them, and without tiring their attention, converse with them as a parent or a friend.

f In all prisons, it would be an excellent improvement to have crib beds for each person, like those at Haflar, and the royal hospital at Plymouth. (See Plate II. B.) These may be made of call iron, without sides, nearly as cheap as of oak. The beds or cradles at Plymouth are fourteen inches from the floor: three feet one inch high at the head, and two feet three inches at the feet: six feet two inches long, and three feet one inch wide in the clear. The boards on the sides (three feet eight inches long) slide in an inch groove. A medicine box hangs by two hooks at the back of each cradle, which is necessary only in infirmaries. To these cradles are hair mattresses, bedding, &c. If offenders have only loose straw, though with a coverlet, they must lie in their clothes, and of necessity be dirty and sickly objects. Therefore proper bedding is necessary. Without this, how can habits of cleanliness be produced and promoted in young creatures ? or what disposition can such have for work?

J The notion, that convicts are ungovernable, is certainly erroneous. There is a mode of managing some of the most desperate, with ease to yourself, and advantage to them. Many of them are shrewd and sensible;: manage them with calmness, yet with ffeadiness: shew them that you. have humanity, and that you aim.to make them useful members of society: let them see and hear the rules and orders of the prison, and be convinced that they are not defrauded in their provisions or clothes by contrndlors or gaolers. When they are sick, let them be treated with tenderness. Such conduct would prevent mutiny in prisons, and attempts to escape; which I am fully persuaded are often owing to prisoners being made desperate, by the inhumanity and ill usage of their keepers.

Chaplain.

for his own good. — The keeper should, by all means, reside in the house. He should not be suffered to farm any part of the allowance: nor to sell liquor, or any thing else. I have often observed, that bridewells are cleaner and quieter where keepers have no licence. He should have no fees *, but a salary proportioned to the trust, that he may not be obliged to follow any business out of the house. — The whole management should be frequently examined, in the same manner as that of a gaol, and by the same fort of inspectors. — In the house there should be a room for the magistrates, as there is in foreign houses of correction, similar to the governors room in hospitals, and in the houses of industry in Suffolk and.Norfolk. The courts of justice fat in the prisons in Scotland formerly] and this is still the case in some of the towns. This would be attended with many advantages. Mr. Henry Fielding remarks, that <c The sufferings of the poor are indeed less observed than their misdeeds; not from " any want of companion, but because they are less known; and this is the true <c reason why we so often hear them mentioned with abhorrence, and so seldom with " pity."

I have before said, that I am no advocate for luxury in prisons; for I would have no meat diet for criminals in houses of correction, or at most, only on Sundays. Yet I would plead, that they should have a pound and a half of good household bread a day, and a quart of good beer: besides twice a day a quart of warm soup made from pease, rice, milk or barley. For a change they might sometimes have turnips, carrots, or potatoes. It may be said, this diet will starve those who work in houses of correction: but I am persuaded of the contrary; by what I have seen abroad, in the galleys, in the houses of correction, and among the most robust labourers. Though I am sensible that persons confined, whose minds are depressed, need more nourishment than such as are at liberty.

I know not any reason why an house of correction may not be conducted with as much regularity, as any other house where the family is equally numerous. Some foreign bridewells are so conducted. — Let the sober and diligent be distinguished by some preference in their diet, or lodging; or by shortening the term of their confinement: and giving them, when discharged, a good character. This last will be a strong incitement to good behaviour. — The hours of rising, of reading a chapter in the Bible, of prayers, of meals, of work, &c. should all be fixed by the magistrates, and notice of them given by a bell. A Chaplain is necessary here in every view. — To reform prisoners, or to make them better as to their morals, should always be the leading view in every house of correction, and their earnings should only be a secondary object. As rational and immortal beings we owe this to them; nor

Many young creatures, when their term is expired, are detained in prison; others stript of a remaining handkerchies, apron, or petticoat. Such necessaries have I seen left with the keepers till they could bring iheir fees.

can any criminality of theirs justify our neglect in this particular. The last recited author fays, " Religion will, I am satisfied, have a strong influence in correcting the <( morals of men; and I am no less persuacted, that it is religion alone which can " effectually accomplish so great and so desirable a work."

Some have supposed that the profit of the work in a house of correction might support the expence of the house. But however it may appear in speculation, in practice it is always found otherwise. The difference is great between involuntary labour and that which is performed from choice. In the belt regulated houses of correction in Holland, taxes are fixed for their support *. But though a bridewell cannot support itself, yefe under proper regulation, it would contribute in some measure towards its own maintenance. An exact account should be kept of the profit of the work; and all of it applied to common benefit; not left to the disposal of keepers: for some of them, in the few bridewells where work is done, keep to themselves a sixth part, some half, and some the whole of the prisoners earnings; giving them only the short county-allowance, and sometimes but part of that. When I said all the earnings should go to common (lock, I meant it of the stated hours for working. Those who will employ themselves in extra-hours, should have the profit to themselves. And it would be an encouragement to diligence in the stated hours, to give them some portion of the profit of these also; or employ them in beating hemp, and spinning, and weaving linen for their own use: for clean linen they should have every week. With regular ceconomy, prisoners would be better nourished, and fitter for labour, than they now are; and yet the county not burthened with much, if any, additional expence. But a building fit for the intention they ought to provide.

The charge of this, as well as of a proper gaol, will, no doubt, be complained of But if that be weighed against the benefit which will accrue to the public, it will be found but light. Besides, that ought not to be allowed as a valid objection, the occasion of which should have been removed long ago. Why have some prisons been suffered to become ruinous, so that many rooms in them are unrsafe, and prisoners are crowded together in the few that remain; or, for the smallest offences are loaded with irons to prevent their escape ? Why were not the walls of the courts repaired in time, that prisoners might with safety be allowed the proper use

of them ? Money, to the amount of thousands, is not with-held when Shire-halls and Town-halls are wanted:(these we see grand and elegant edifices.) Why should it be spared when the morals and lives of multitudes are at (take; and when it is impossible the design of the legislature should be answered without it? I mean, amending the manners of petty offenders; preventing the spread of diseases, and the increase of felonies. That the two latter, instead of being prevented, are promoted by the present irregularity of bridewells, is notorious Prescription founded on culpable negligence should not be admitted in bar' of a demand, which every principle of equity, humanity, and utility conspires to enforce.

I could wish, that no persons might suffer capitally but for murder — for setting houses-on fire — for house-breaking, attended with acts of cruelty. The highwayman — the footpad — the habitual thies, and people of this clan; should end their days in a penitentiary house, rather than on the gallows. " That many cart-loads of our fellow creatures are once in six weeks carried to slaughter, is a dreadful consideration; and this is greatly heightened by refleding, that, with proper care and proper regulations, much the greater part of these wretches might have been made not only " happy in themselves, but very useful members of society, which they now so " greatly dishonour in the fight of all Christendom†."
---
The management of bridewells is now a matter of more than ordinary concern, since offenders are at present committed to them for terms so long as two or three years. Mod of these persons would probably have been sentenced to transportation, when that mode of punishment was more general.

I had taken some pains to make inquiries concerning the date of Transports, with regard to whom many cruelties and impositions were commonly practised, and whose condition was in many respects equally contrary to humanity and good policy: I flattered myself that I had discovered means of remedying these evils in a considerable degree, and of disburthening the counties of a heavy expence with which they were charged; and was preparing to lay them before the public, when a new turn was given to the matter by the late act of parliament‡.

* The benevolent Marquis Beccaria closes his 31st chapter with this maxim. "The punishment of a crime cannot be just, (that is necessary) if the laws have not endeavoured to prevent that crime by the best means which times and circumstances would allow."

† H. Fielding*s Enquiry, page ult.

‡ 16th of George III. Cap. XLIII. "An act to authorise, for a limited time, the punishment by hard labour of Offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations." Mr. Eden has observed that "The numbers of persons for whom some mode of restraint and punishment in lieu of transportation must be provided, may be estimated at one thousand annually." See the Preface to his Draught of a Bill, 1778. If the impolitic mode of transportation be again adopted, the cruelty should not be aggravated by confining convicts a long time before they are sent off.

Sect. III. PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS. 43

Since this has taken place, I suppress what I had written*; and will only give, at the end of my book, a list of the numbers delivered from Newgate for transportation in the course of three years. This will shew, in a very alarming light, the danger there may be in future of crowding our prisons, so as to produce the most destructive consequences.

I cannot conclude this section, without attempting to obviate some objections that may occur to the improvements proposed in it. It may be said, that from the many conveniences suggested in the structure of prisons, and the removal of those hardships which rendered them so terrible, the dread of being confined in them will in great measure be taken off, and the lower classes of people will find them more comfortable places of residence than their own houses. But let it be considered in the first place, that although I have indeed recommended such attention in the construction and management as may free them from the diseases and hardships under which they have laboured, I have proposed nothing to give them an air of elegance or pleasantness. On the contrary, I have censured the plan of some modern gaols as too shewy and splendid; and nothing abroad struck me more with regard to these buildings, than the perfect plainness and simplicity of their appearance. Then, with respect to the more humane treatment of the prisoners in the articles of food, lodging, and the like, I venture to assert, that if to it be joined such strict regulations in preventing all dissipation and riotous amusement, as I have inculcated, confinement in a prison, though it may cease to be destructive to health and morals, will not fail to be sufficiently irksome and disagreeable, especially to the idle and profligate.

The Penitentiary houses directed by a late act of parliament, may, under proper management, be made to answer very useful purposes. Much, however, will depend upon their proper regulation. I do not pretend to be qualified for drawing up a perfect system of this difficult business; but in order to assist persons of superior abilities in their researches on this subject, I have added, at the end of the volume, a table of such general heads and particulars as seem to me most deserving of attention.

* On the whole, I perfectly concur in opinion with a learned writer, who has asserted that "every effect of banishment, as practised in England, is often beneficial to the criminal, and always injurious to the community." Principles of Penal Law, p. 33.

SECTION IV.

AN ACCOUNT OF FOREIGN PRISONS AND HOSPITALS.

I DESIGNED to publish the account of our prisons in the spring 1775, after I returned from Scotland and Ireland. But conjecturing that something useful to my purpose might be collected abroad; I laid aside my papers, and travelled into France, Flanders, Holland, and Germany. I flattered myself that my labour was not quite fruitless; and repeated my visit to these countries, and went also to Switzerland, in 1776.

In the conclusion of my first edition, I made a promise, if the legislature should seriously engage in the reformation of our prisons, to take a third journey, through the Prussian and Austrian dominions, and the free cities of Germany. This I accomplished in 1778, and likewise extended my tour through Italy, and revisited some of the countries I had before seen in pursuit of my object. These observations were published in a second edition in 1780. But before the publication of another edition, I wished to acquire some further knowledge on the subject. For this purpose in 1781 I again revisited Holland, and some cities in Germany. I visited also the capitals of Denmark, Sweden, Russia and Poland; and in 1783 some cities in Portugal and Spain, and returned through France, Flanders and Holland. The substance of all these travels is now thrown into one narrative. — I have only to add, that, fully sensible of the imperfection that must attend the cursory survey of a traveller, it was my study to remedy that defect by confining my attention to the one object of my pursuit, during the whole of my journies abroad.

HOLLAND.

Prisons in the United Provinces are so quiet, and most of them so clean, that a visitor can hardly believe he is in a gaol. They are commonly (except the rasp-houses) white-washed once or twice a year: and prisoners observed to me how refreshing it was to come into the rooms after they had been so thoroughly cleaned.

Sect. IV. HOLLAND. 45

A physician and surgeon is appointed to every prison; and prisoners are in general healthy.
---
In most of the prisons for criminals there are so many rooms that each prisoner is kept separate. They never go out of their rooms: each has a bedstead, draw mat, and coverlet. But there are few criminals, except those in the rasp-houses and Jpin-houses. Of late, in all the seven provinces, seldom more executions in a year than from four to fix. One reason of this, I believe, is the awful solemnity of executions, which are performed in presence of the magistrates, with great order and seriousness, and great effect on the spectators. I did not see the process in Holland; but it was particularly described to me, and was similar to what I had been witness of in another place abroad.

The common method of execution for unpremeditated murder, is decollation by a broad sword. Robberies are generally punished by the halter. For the more atrocious crimes, such as premeditated murder, &c. the melefactor is broken on the wheel; or rather on a cross laid flat upon the scaffold. But a description of the manner of this execution, which is finished by a coup de.grace on the bread, would not, be agreeable to any of my readers.

Debtors also are but few. The magistrates do not approve of confining in idleness any that may be usefully employed. And when one is imprisoned, the creditor mud pay the gaoler for his maintenance, from five and a half to eighteen divers a day, according to the debtor's former condition in life. The aliment mud be paid every week: in default whereof, the gaoler gives eight days notice; and if within that time, the money, or security for it, be not brought, the debtor is discharged.

Another reason is, that the situation is very disgraceful. But, perhaps, the principal cause that debtors, as well as capital offenders, are few, is the great care that is taken to train up the children of the poor, and indeed of all others, to industry.

No debtors have their wives and children living with them in prison: but occasional visits in the day-time are not forbidden. You do not hear in the dreets as you pass by a prison, what I have been rallied for abroad, the cry of poor hungry starving debtors.

The States do not transport convicts , but men are put to labour in the rasp-houses, and women to proper work in the spin-houses: upon this professed maxim, Make them diligent, and they will be honest. The rasping logwood, which was formerly the principal work done by the male convicts, is now in many places performed at the mills, much cheaper: and the Dutch, finding woollen manufactures more profitable, have lately set up several of them in those houses of correction. In some, the work 4

of the robuff prisoners does not only support them; but they have a little extra-time to earn somewhat for their better living in prison, or for their benefit afterwards.

Great care is taken to give them moral and religious instruction, and reform their manners, for their own and the public good. The chaplain (such there is in every

46 FOREIGN PRISONS.

Rotterdam.

house of correction) does not only perform public worship, but privately instructs the prisoners, catechifcs them every week, &c. and I am well informed, that many come out sober and honest *. Some have even chosen to continue and work in the house after their discharge.

Offenders are sentenced to these houses, according to -their crimes, for seven, ten, fifteen, twenty, and even to ninety-nine years: but, to prevent despair, seldom for life. As an encouragement to sobriety and industry, those who distinguish themselves by such behaviour, are discharged before the expiration of their term. And the prisoner who gives information of an intended escape is greatly favoured in this respect: his term is shortened, and sometimes he gains his liberty. A little before the election of new magistrates, those who are in office inspect these prisons; and inquire of the keeper which prisoners, of those who have been confined a few years, have been diligent and orderly; and of the minister, which of them have been most attentive to public and private instructions. According to the accounts, they abridge the appointed time of punishment: so that fourteen years will sometimes be reduced to eight or ten; and twelve years to six or seven. This practice is in every view wife and beneficial. Indeed, I have some reason to think that criminals are often doomed to a longer term, with an intention to make such deductions upon their amendment.

I was informed that the produce of the work does not maintain theffr houses: though the men that are robust earn from eight to ten stivers a day; and healthy women by spinning, &c. from four to fix. But some earn less; and those that are infirm, very little: none however are quite idle, unless sick. This is surely excellent policy; for besides guarding against the pernicious effects of idleness in a prison, and breaking criminals to habits of industry, if work so constant does not support the houses, how much heavier would be the public burthen, maintaining the numerous offenders in these prisons, if, as in many of our bridewells, no work at all were done there

In Holland, as well as in Germany, there are private rooms in most of the houses of correction, in which young persons of a vicious and profligate turn are confined on the representation of their parents, till they shew signs of amendment.

At Rotterdam, in the Stadt-house prison, there were no debtors in either of the three rooms at any of my former visits, but in 1781 there was one debtor. When

I have heard in England that a countryman of ours, who was a prisoner in the rasp-house at Amfter-dam several years, was permitted to work at his own trade, shoe-making; and by being constantly kept employed, was quite cured of the vices that were the cause of his confinement. My informant added, that the prisoner received at his release a surplus of his earnings, which enabled him to set up his trade in London where he lived in credit; and at dinner commonly drank n Health to his worthy matters at the rasp-house."

there are any, they are alimented at one fixed sum, viz. sixteen slivers a day There are seven vaulted rooms for criminals or disorderly persons about seventeen feet by ten. One of them is called the condemned room, into which a criminal is put fourteen days before his final sentence; and immediately after the sentence, he is executed with a solemnity very striking to the common people. In three of the rooms, were three persons confined for a limited time for some small offences, and kept to bread and water. Their daily allowance was fora four to five slivers, and their pitcher was filled with water three times a day; but the other criminals had their pitcher filled once a day with beer, and their allowance was from nine to ten slivers. There were cases with thick straw mats, and two or three coverlets to each. At my last visit there were four criminals.

In the Rasp-house, (or Spin-house as it should be called) at one of my former visits there were thirty-eight men, and in 1781, twenty-eight men and forty women. Two men were rasping logwood, others, combing, spinning, and carding wool, and (a few) making fishing nets, and sorting coffee-berries. The women were spinning wool and flax, and carding hair, or winding at a great wheel like those which at Derby are turned by water. They were clean, and appeared healthy and well. I observed the ceiling was very white; and one of the regents informed me, that the room was white-washed regularly twice a year.

The men were more separated than the women into rooms (about seventeen feet long, eleven feet broad, and ten high), each of which contained only four or five prisoners. These rooms were very offensive; the persons confined in them being taken out only once in the week. For preventing combinations, two of the men are removed every ten or fourteen days, to different companies. There were among them some Jews, whose dinner was not pork as was that of the other prisoners, but muttony which the society of Jews in the city sent them with a slice of white bread by permission of one of the five regents or inspectors -J-.

For the refractory there are dark rooms, but not dungeons: in one of these, on shutting the door on myself, I found no dampness. My conductor observed, that the floor was raised to preserve it dry. Here they are allowed no bedding, and are kept to bread and water, which is given them at an aperture in the doer. Their confinement is for fix, eight, ten, or fourteen days.

A guinea 2521!. is = 11 guilders 11 stivers = 231 stivers (for 20 stivers is a guilder) therefore stivers are to pence as \\\ =\i ?' e. 11 stivers is equal to a shilling.

t As I was there at one o'clock, the time of the distribution, I observed that the bread was all cut in slices: this prevents those contests or frauds which sometimes happen where prisoners mess together, and the bread is given out in one loaf; as I saw on board the hulks in the Thames, where one loaf was given to six persons.

At the whipping-post (which is in the middle of the court, in full view of the male criminals) some of our dexterous countrymen in 1781, were disciplined, for melting their pewter spoons and forming them into keys. The pewter was hardened with a mixture procured from an apothecary, under the pretence of its being a remedy for the tooth-ach. But the scheme was defeated by an English Jew, who for this service obtained his liberty, though he had been committed for thirty years.

The regents have a room in which they assemble once a fortnight. Their ladies assemble in another room to give directions concerning the work, linen, provisions, &c. They also attend by rotation at dinner, and other times; and their accounts are carried to the regents*.

The keeper has a salary from the city, of four hundred florins or guilders per annum -|*, and also a house, victuals and drink, firing and candle, and one seventh part of the produce of all the labour of the prisonersfo that it is his interest to see that the work be well performed: yet as the quantum is fixed by the regents, it is not in his power to be a cruel task-master. The manner of dieting the prisoners seemed to me worthy of being inserted at length J.

A principal reason of the cleanliness and order in work-houses in Holland, is the attention and humanity of the Governesses: for each house has four who take the charge of inspection, and have their names painted in their room.

Being at Rotterdam on a Sunday, I was desirous of seeing, whether there was such dissipation in their prisons, as there is in ours, on that day. The public service at the Rasp-house began at half after one o'clock. The audience confided of about thirty or forty inhabitants of the town, Mr. Schumacher the presiding regent, the head-keeper and his family, and three under-keepers, besides the prisoners. The number of women prisoners was about forty, who were separated from the rest of the congregation by a wooden palisade, and seated on benches raised one above another. They were all clean and neat had nothing distinguishing in their dress, but were without hats. While they flood up during prayer, they held up their aprons to cover their faces. The men were neat, dressed in brown coats, had been shaved, had clean shirts (which were most of them chequed), clean dockings, and wore handkerchiefs about their necks. They also were seated on raised benches, in a room out of the chapel, and separated from it by an iron grate from the top of the room to the bottom, so wide that all the audience except the female prisoners, had them full

in view. The keeper's feat adjoins to this grate, and two of his servants, who are turnkeys, fat observing their behaviour.

The chaplain, after a short prayer, preached extempore; then, the men convicts joined in singing, most of them having books. When the chaplain had prayed again, he catechised for about three quarters of an hour. It being the women's turn that Sunday, six of them stood up, one after another, and made the responses, which the chaplain explained to them. After this he prayed, and the service concluded by singing the fifty-first Psalm. The decent behaviour and attention of the audience, evidently proved that the service, though of two hours and a half, was not tedious or disagreeable.

During the time of catechising, the head-keeper and one of his servants went out, to inspect the empty wards, and to search whether any tools or instruments were concealed. The keeper returned to his feat in an hour. At the end of the service, the women passed by the regents feat *; and when they were gone, he went into the court to see the men go to their several wards, four or five together, that number only being let out at a times. After they were all locked up, he went to each window, and conversed with them. Many of them returned their thanks for the abridgment of their term of confinement, as this was just before the time for electing new magistrates. One or two who had been at sea, entreated to go in any capacity to India, as is sometimes permitted. He afterwards went to the lattice of the women's ward, and conversed with them; and gave the catechumens some token of his approbation.

I cannot forbear closing this account, without mentioning the ardent wishes it inspired in me, that our prisons also, instead of echoing with profaneness and blasphemy, might hereafter resound with the offices of religious worship; and prove; like these, the happy means of awakening many to a sense of their duty to God and

The Pejl-house across the Maes opposite Rotterdam is a spacious building in a small isle. It is a square of one hundred and fifty-four feet: has four large wards, two of which are eighty-seven by thirty, and twenty-one high. I mention this edifice, not only as it occurred to me that it would be a good plan for a house of correction, being airy, and built round a court in which is a bason of water communicating with the Maes; but on account of the sentiments of veneration it

inspired, when I trod on the ground under which such piles of my brave countrymen lie buried; it having been used as a military hospital after the siege of Bergen-of-Zoom.

In 1781 I visited the few English prisoners of war in Holland, who were confined in the Admiralty at Rotterdam. A room was assigned for the officers, in which there were only two. In another room (twenty-one feet by eighteen and fifteen feet high) there were eleven sailors, who appeared healthy and well. Several had died a little time before, which, I apprehend, was in part owing to their being confined in a small room called the hospital, which was dirty, without a chimney, and its sides were wood. Their allowance was eight stivers a day, a bed an^ coverlet, and on most days they walked some hours in the court.

At Dordrecht (or Dort) the prison is in the Stadt-house. It consists of rooms up stairs which are distinguished on the outside by strong iron-bars in the windows. In this prison there are seldom any prisoners, though the jurisdiction (or bailiwick) extends through thirty villages. There was one criminal here in November 1781. And I have been well informed, that for thirty or forty years there has been but one debtor here, and that he continued in confinement only fourteen days.

The rooms in the prison at Middleburg are spacious, lofty and clean. The three dungeons are used to force a confession; as there is no direct torture, and the criminal is not executed till the crime is confessed. The allowance to a criminal is eight stivers a day.

In the House of correction the prisoners were employed in weaving cloth or sacking for the East India company. This is more profitable than their late employment on coarse carpeting. None were in irons. No more than four persons were in any of the men's rooms; in some there were but two. Each criminal pays three guilders at his entrance, and the same at his discharge.

The prison at Breda is an old tower. In 1781 there were no prisoners in it except one boy, though thirteen villages, and some of them large, are under the jurisdiction of this city. The allowance to criminals is five stivers a day. — I was informed, that the torture-stool, in the chamber of examination, has not been used for many years.

In the new house of correction (in 1778) there were eleven men and two women prisoners; and in November 1781, fifteen men and four women. They were employed on a coarse carpeting like the Scotch carpeting, but much cheaper. The specimen I purchased cost only eleven stivers (or a shilling) their ell, which is two feet four inches. The prisoners are always confined to their rooms, which are latticed with wood from top to bottom, and open into the passages. In this and other similar houses the passages are very offensive, for the keepers will never open the windows. It would therefore be much better if the upper part of the windows were wire latticed.

I here give the plan of the house taken by the builder, who has been particularly attentive to the construction of the drains and sewers, which are of the greatest importance to the health of prisoners.

The old house of correction was burnt down about ten years since, and seven women perished in the flames. In the construction of the new prison, proper precautions were taken against such an accident, by laying the beams, or large joists edgeways, ealing the two undersides of them with iron plates, and arching the space with, brick work.

At La Porte, the prison at Gouda, there is a small room for debtors, which the keeper informed me had not been occupied since 1761. There are many (octagon) rooms, but all empty: some are assigned to those who are committed for small offences, and kept to bread and water, for which there is an allowance to each of them of three stivers a day. — In the Spin-house the prisoners were all employed in carding and spinning wool for stockings. On observing little towels hanging in one room, they told me, that each of them had one clean every week. Here were some prisoners from the Hague, and other towns which have no rasp-houses, who were admitted at a stipulated annual sum, of about a hundred and ten florins for each, besides fifteen for clothing. — Near this city is inclosed a triangular gallows, with an inscription over the gate.

Recte faciendo neminem timeas.

The best translation of which may be the words of Scripture,

"The righteous is bold as a lion."

At Delft over the gate of the house of correction (Tucht en Dol-huis) there is a representation of two men raping logwood, and the city arms, dated 1682. At my first visit here, were near ninety of both sexes, and in 1781, forty-seven men and thirty-six women. The men and women were quite separate; all neat and clean, and looked healthy. They told me their allowance was five stivers a day. All were employed on a woollen manufacture — women spinning, carding, &:c. — men weaving from coarse to very fine cloth: their talk, to earn thirty-five stivers a week. Some earn a small surplus, but they have only half of it. A burgomaster, to whom I mentioned that circumstance, said it was the truth. They do not put more than eight or ten men to work in one room: for when large numbers are together, one idle person corrupts more; and there is not generally so much work done. Here also, if a prisoner has behaved well for a few years, and given proofs of amendment, the magistrates begin to abridge the time for which he was sentenced. One whom I saw very cheerful, told me the cause of his joy was, that a year had lately been taken from his term.

Near the men's court there are several rooms for the insane, but the particular description of the excellent hospital at Amsterdam will excuse my omission of others.

HOLLAND. 53

At the Hague I was honoured with the ver y polite assistance of Sir Joseph York. A magistrate accompanied me to the prison; where all was quiet and in order. The same gentleman presented me with a copy of instructions to the sheriff of the court: a copy of rules for officers of the attorney-general; and with a M. S. copy on several sheets of forty-four rules for the management of the prison. — The gaoler is never suffered to lleep out of the house, but with the express consent of the court, or the advocate &c. and when that leave is, on any special occasion, granted, he must provide a substitute approved by the court &c. This substitute is sworn to his temporary office. If any prisoner escapes, whether by the immediate fault of the keeper, or the fault of his servants, he is to suffer the punishment that was due to the prisoner. He may not keep a tavern or alehouse: nor play at cards &c. with his prisoners: nor accept of any treat or gift from them, directly or indirectly, during their confinement or afterwards. He must keep the prison neat and clean: furnifti frefti straw once a week; and in winter, coverlets. The attorney-general, or his deputy, is to see that all this be duly preformed. The keeper is to supply prisoners with good bread, soup and beer. Those who pay eighteen stivers a day (or what other sum the magistrates shall allow them to expend) are to have provision proportioned to that price. Visitants are not permitted to be in the prison from eleven in the morning till two: and are dismissed in the evening at six in summer, and four in winter. None to be admitted on Saturday: nor in time of divine service on Sunday. Candles to be taken away at nine. The keeper to guard against accidents by fire.

The rules for officers of the high-bailiff, and of the sheriff, have an admirable effect in preserving peace, and order. There are thirty-two of them. I cannot forbear abstracting a few. No officer to stir out of town without special leave: and while in town each must always give notice where he may be found. In case of fire, they must immediately repair to the court-gate for instructions. Arrests of delinquents must be performed quietly. No officer to serve or watch instead of another. Neglect of duty through drunkenness is punished with living in prison on bread and water at their own expence for three days — eight days — and at last, with discharge. They may not keep company with any persons in public houses See. Giving ill language is punished by a fine: quarrels, at discretion of the magistrates. Not giving information of defaulters is punished with discharge. They are to guard against being guilty of ill behaviour of any fort, that no dishonour may be cast upon the court of judicature. Each officer to have a copy of the rules, and keep it to shew on demand, on pain of a fine. The whole to bfe read to them all together by the sheriff once a month.

In the house of correction at Leyden they were fourteen men and twenty women all employed in spinning wool. The talk for each was thirty-two stivers a week.

The Pest-house near Leyden is similar to that at Rotterdam, but more spacious. The crew of the Barker East indiaman which was wrecked on this coast, were here confined. One of the large rooms is now fitted up with beds, &c. for the reception of wounded seamen. But very injudiciously, it has been contracted by two partitions through its whole length.

[Harlem Spin-house.]

At Harlem, the Spin-house (which is the work-house or poor-house) being old, is not so airy and commodious as modern buildings. Here were about thirty male and fifteen female offenders. The latter were at work with the mother (as they call her) making and mending the linen of the house. The former were weaving coarse linen, in which, at the distance of every six inches, there was a blue stripe, to distinguish the linen of the house, and to prevent its being in any manner disposed of elsewhere. One person was working at a loom on flowered silk damask, because that had been his former trade. Taylors were also employed in the way of their profession. The room in which the women worked, and that in which they slept, were quite clean. Each bed had two persons allotted to it, and they were all allowed sheets. The poor here, as in other work-houses in Holland, appeared clean and comfortable, and were decently clad.?

Harlem Hospital?

In this city (as in some others) is a noble Hospital, airy and spacious, called the Proeveniers, in which the persons admitted are decently provided with meat, drink and lodging during their lives, and a burying place at their decease. Persons of all ages from twenty to the most advanced period are admitted, though it is not common for any under forty to apply for admission. At entrance, each person pays a greater or smaller sum, according to his age, as by the table in the note *. A common table is provided for all who are not sick or infirm. If any after residing some time, choose to have their victuals brought to their rooms, rather than eat in common, they must pay for that privilege according to their age, one fifth part of the sum that would be required for admission at that age. For example — if a person of seventy years of age

chooses to eat in his apartments, he must pay one fifth of the admission money required at the age of seventy, namely, four hundred and twenty florins.

It often happens that there are not vacant places, when persons desire admission. But many secure places before a vacancy, by paying two hundred florins in advance of their entrance money*, in consequence of which, their names are inscribed in a list; and the money deducted from the sum required when they enter.

Those who choose to leave the house entirely, receive, during the remainder of their lives, a certain, though very small, interest of the sum which they paid at admission*.

At Amsterdam the prison is in the Stadt-house. Debtors and felons quite separate. No court. Visitants may converse with debtors at the lattices of their rooms from nine to twelve in the forenoon. The debtor may buy an anchor of wine to deposite with the keeper (who sells liquors): he is allowed to call for a bottle of it a day, paying the keeper two {livers a bottle. — The city allows each debtor one quart of beer daily, and turf for firing.

By conversing with the debtors, I found that they were all alimented alike, the first fourteen days at eleven stivers or a shilling a day; after that time at five stivers and a half. But this is paid to the gaoler, who has great profit out of it, as appeared from the daily allowance, which I weighed several times. — Their two rooms are thoroughly cleaned and white-washed twice a year.

In this city they compute 2 50,000 fouls -j-, about one third of those in London:

For this account I am indebted to Dr. Maelaine, the worthy minister of the English church at the Hague.

yet in 1775, I found but eighteen debtors; — in 1776, only fifteen; in 1778, eighteen; — in June 1781 sixteen, and in November, seventeen; — and in June 1783, seventeen*.

The walls of this prison are stone twenty-two inches thick; most of the rooms ten feet by nine and a half; each for one prisoner only; a bedstead &e. The doorway twenty-two inches wide, door three inches and a half thick, and plated with iron; the condemned rooms have an iron door besides. There are on the ground-floor two rooms for debtors, and twelve or thirteen for criminals, which open into passages seven feet wide; and below ground there are eight rooms more for criminals. The windows are double barred, and open into a passage in which there is a strong door between every two cells. In the condemned rooms a criminal is never left alone: two prisoners from the rasp-house are always with him to prevent his destroying himself. They rejoice at the service; for if they discharge it faithfully, their reward is an abridgment of their allotted term. The execution is generally performed within forty-eight hours after sentence. From a book containing the names and crimes of all who have been executed at Amsterdam, from January 1693 to the end of 1766, the following state of executions at different periods is drawn.

From 1693 to 1735 (43 years) 288.

1736 — 1745 (10 years) 20.

1746 — 1766 (21 years) 28.

And I have been well informed, that in the eight years preceding my visit in 1783, only five criminals were executed; two of them were beheacted, one broke on the wheel, and two hanged.

The instruments of torture are still in the magistrates room, I hope only interroremt for the laws in general are not sanguinary, and justice is executed, though with a steady, yet with a lenient hand.

In 1776, in the Stadt-house there were six delinquents , in 1778 only five, and their offences not being capital, all the strong rooms under ground were empty. In 1781 there was none, in 1783 only two petty offenders. Their allowance is nine stivers a day, for which the keeper gives them — in the morning, four slices of bread and butter — at dinner, rice soup, and two slices of bread — at supper, milk — besides about a quart of beer a day; and on Sunday three quarters of a pound of meat. He also pays for their weekly (having, and for washing their linen. In some other provinces the allowance is the same: in some, more. One of the magistrates, with whom

There are two places in this country, Viane and Culenburg, (not far from Utrecht) whole ancient privileges exempt them from the juridiction of Holland. In those places a few debtors screen themselves from arrests.

Sect.IV. HOLLAND.

[Amsterdam

I was conversing upon the subject of English prisons, said, " Nourish your prisoners well, and keep them in dry rooms, and they will be healthy

The children of the malefactors who are executed, and of those who are committed for a long term, to the rasp, or spin-house, are sent to the orphan-house, and there brought up in industry, and not left destitute vagabonds to become unhappy victims to the wickedness and folly of their parents.

[Rasp-house.]

At the Rasp-house over the gate, there is in has relief \ a device of a man driving a waggon loaded with logwood, drawn by lions, wild boars, and tigers, with this inscription,

Virtutis eft domare Quce cunEli pavent.

Over this device, there is a representation of two men in chains, with a woman near them, holding the arms of Amsterdam in her left hand, and a whip in her right, and over her head the word Castigatio. At the inner gate is (as at other rasp-houses) a representation of two men rasping logwood: which is here their principal employment. Yet regard is had, not only to their degree of guilt, but to their strength: for I saw two men winding silk. In summer 1776 there were fifty-four prisoners. In fbme rooms, where they also sleep, there were ten or twelve men rasping an appointed talk. Others were in the warehouses, sorting and weighing; others bringing the wood to those rooms. Hours of work from six to twelve, and from one to four. In extrahours they make tobacco-boxes, &c. which they sell to visitants, who pay two stivers to go in.

The four regents who manage the Rasp-house are appointed by the burgomasters, to whom they are accountable f. The gaoler or father is strictly obliged to obey all the orders of the high-bailiff, the burgomasters, and also of the regents. In no case may he, or any of his family, receive a gift from the prisoners or their friends, either before or after their enlargement. He must not entrust a servant with the keys, but must himself carefully search the convicts and their cots, or rooms, before he locks them up in the evening] at six o'clock in summer, and at four in winter.

In many of the towns in Holland I purchased the different sorts of bread of various bakers, not only to see if the police was strict in that necessary article, but also to compare the prices with those of other places, and particularly of London.

At Amsterdam, June 5, 1778, the two-stiver loaf of white bread weighed exactly I lb. — the one and half-stiver loaf of best rye bread, I lb. io ox. — the black rye bread, a doit less than a stiver per lb. As eleven stivers is equal to one shilling, the white bread was above two pence a pound. In 1781 bread was somewhat dearer. By a list of the assize of bread put up at the Stadt-house, June 7, 1783; white bread was 11 oz. for two stivers, and black rye bread was one stiver a pound.

of It may be proper to mention, that these regents have no salaries, but only foine privileges and honorary distinctions; as exemption from the city watch.; liberty of free entrance after one of the city gates is shut; and a deacon's feat in the church.

must never be absent a night, without special permission. He is severely punished if any prisoner escapes. He must register in order all acts concerning commitments and discharges, and produce them to the regents when required. Also he must keep an exact register of the clothes, and all other things which belong to those confined.

The regents assemble in the house at four o'clock every Wednesday afternoon, to collect and examine the transactions of the preceding week. They appoint a servant to give any necessary assistance to the father, to cut the slices of bread for the prisoners; and when the father is ill, in the evening to visit and examine the cots.

In the nine lower rooms of this house, in June 1778, were confined upwards of forty prisoners5 in June 1781, fifty-five; in November, sixty-five; June 6, 1783, fifty-one. One of these was incapable of working, his limbs having been dislocated by the torture. Each of these rooms, in which they work in the day and are locked up at night, contains at least four persons. The same prisoners do not continue long together, but are removed and separated once a fortnight or oftener. Few or none of them were rasping logwood, but most of them chopping it for the two mills belonging to the house: as it was found to be too laborious for most of the prisoners, to work with six or eight saws, which often weigh seventy or eighty pounds. The medical gentlemen, who daily visit the prison, informed the magistrates that it had been the cause of frequent ruptures*.

No friends of the prisoners are permitted to visit them, without express orders from the regents, unless on Mondays: and then they must be searched, to prevent the introduction of spirituous liquors, or instruments for breaking out, or any thing else forbidden: and they must retire before the time for shutting up. Every visitant is obliged to put two stivers into a box entrusted with the father. Refreshments may be received and given to the convicts on Tuesdays; but not on other days. Every evening, at eight o'clock, the father must see that all things are in due order. The saws, and other heavy implements for their work, are taken from them in the evening, and returned in the morning. If a convict be guilty of breaking any thing considerable, of burning the logwood, or of neglect or disobedience, he is punished severely by whipping, or confined to bread and water in a dungeon under ground. On careful inquiry, I learned, that what has been said concerning a cellar in which such transgressors are put to pump or drown, is a fiction.

Prayers are read morning and evening, and before and after meals, by one of the best-behaved convicts: and divine service, with a sermon, is performed in the chapel by a clergyman on Sunday mornings.

Once a year, a little before the change of the regency, the high-bailiff and magistrates, with a secretary, attended by the inferior officers of justice, come to this prison, in order

to contraB or lengthen the terms of confinement of the convicts, according to their good or bad behaviour, as represented by the regents.

The house provides for the prisoners, diet*, clothes, shoes.and stockings, with shirts of half-bleached Flemish linen. Here is no infirmary: their labour keeps them in health: the physician, with whom I went the round at my last visit, had only two patients, and those with very flight disorders.

Some persons are confined in private rooms, to which none have access, unless in the presence of a regent. Great care is enjoined the father in conveying provisions to those prisoners. With the regents leave, on Sunday mornings, some chapters of the Bible are read to themf.

The Spin-house was for women. This, and the work-house, were under the direction of six regents and four governesses; who appointed two fathers and two mothers to superintend and inspect the work, the diet, and the lodging of the prisoners; and to chastise the disobedient.

The work-room was a large room up stairs, separated by a wooden balustrade from the passage (six feet wide) into which spectators were admitted. This room was divided by balustrades into two, for distinguishing those who had suffered some public or corporal punishment, from others who had not been whipped, and exposed

f There are many of these rooms, or houses of confinement in Holland, called Verbeterhuizen. The regulations of some of them I collected; but as they are liable to abuse, and contrary to the general notions of public ffice, I cannot but wish that they were universally suppressed.

on a scaffold. The mother was seated at adefk (where she had a full view of her family at work) with a Bible before her. As I *staid longer than a common visitant, one of the prisoners went up to the mistress with the timid modesty of a suppliant, and asked leave to offer me the plate. The leave was granted. The mistress kept what was given, till it amounted to a sum sufficient to purchase a little tea or coffee, for all to partake.

The kitchen, the dining and lodging-rooms, were on the ground-floor. In each of the three bed-rooms were ten wooden cases, with a straw mattress, two coverlets, sheets, and one large pillow, for two persons. All were clean, and shewed the attention of the regents.

In this house you might see a number of criminals (in 1776, there were thirty-two; in 1778, forty-six; in June 1781, thirty-two, and in November, forty) some of whom had been the most abandoned, fitting in presence of the mother, quiet and orderly at their different forts of work; spinning, plain work, &c. Of the latter fort much was sent in from the city. They had the same holidays as at the Rasp-house. Hours of work from six to twelve, and from one to eight. I saw them go from work to dinner*: the keeper, or father as they called him, presided. First they fang a psalm: then they went in order down to a neat dining-room; where they seated themselves at two tables; and several dishes of boiled barley, agreeably sweetened, were set before them. The father struck with a hammer: then in profound silence all flood up; and one of them read with propriety, a prayer about four or five minutes. Then they fat down cheerful; and each filled her bowl, from a large dish which contained enough for four of them. Then one brought on a waiter slices of bread and butter, and served each prisoner.

This house was supported by a small annual Tax on those who sell tobacco, beer, and other liquors, and one fourth fart of what was received at public exhibitions and diversions.

At my visit in June 1783, the prisoners were all removed into the new work-house.

Here (as at some other towns in Holland) was a prison or Work-house for (lighter offences. This was called the old rasp-house, and was worthy of observation, as a well regulated house of industry. Here were confined beggars and vagabonds, who for the first time were committed for six weeks, and for the second three months; but for the third their punishment was either a longer period of confinement or banishment. — Drunkards also were here confined, and such as were guilty of petty larceny. — In a large room at one of my visits I saw forty-six women carding, spinning and reeling; twelve weaving coarse linen or sail-cloth; thirteen making and mending linen; one employed in keeping the room clean; and the mother holding a Hate, on which were inscribed the names of the prisoners *. Some men and boys were in another large room, in which there were many looms. But most of the men were at work in the courts, boiling and picking oakum for calking the seams of ships. Among these men I counted forty or fifty women; and in 1781, there were twenty-five men and one hundred and twenty women all employed in the same manner f; except five or six who were mending the linen of the house.

The women's bed-room was spacious; and I found it clean and in order, though I was there before ten o'clock in the forenoon.

This house was provided, with (what seems to be much wanted in the Dutch prisons.) an infirmary: but it was too small and close for the purpose.

The diet of the prisoners was the same as in the Spin-house J. Their provisions were bought in considerable quantities. The rye for bread was on the floor in an airy room, and was sweet and good. The produce of the prisoners work was applied to the maintenance of the house, and the deficiency was made up from the Spin-house tax. The expence for each prisoner was full five stivers a day. Their number was generally from a hundred and fifty, to two hundred. — These prisoners are removed into the New fVork-houfie or house of correction, which at my visit in June 1783, was finished. There were four hundred prisoners. The ingenious architect Mr. Vander Hart favoured me with the plan of this elegant and commodious building.

Three fathers and three mothers were appointed to superintend this house. One father had the direction of the house-keeping, and the other two overlooked the manufactory. One mother managed the kitchen; and the office of the others was to keep the prisoners cleanly, and to take care of their bedding.

t The prisoners at the new work-house have the same employment: here is a quick sale for oakum; for the Admiralty and India company find the old cords, and take the oakum when fit for use.

J Though in the houses of correction in Holland, the prisoners have meat only on Sundays, yet the pease, beans, barley, &c. are always made into a kind of thick soup or pottage, which is very palatable, and is served up hot at noon,

Dol-huis.

Orphan-

house.

I must not omit the Dol-huis, an hospital for the insane, as it is the bed of the kind I ever saw, and would be a good plan for a bridewell, with the addition of working rooms. The ground plot is rectangular (eighty feet by fifty-five): the keeper's house takes up. one of the shorter sides: the other three sides have, on the ground-floor, rooms in the recess of a walk eight feet and a half wide under arcades, enclosed from the area or garden by a wall to the height of near four feet; the upper part, to the crown of the arch, open. Each person has a separate room ten feet four inches by seven feet, and ten high, with two doors: some of the inner doors are latticed; the outer frequently Hand open. Over the door is an aperture in the wall of about a foot diameter, with a shutter.

In a small court there are twelve rooms (marked with the letters of the alphabet) for the outrageous. Each has one strong door, always shut, with an aperture for the introduction of victuals, which are put into a clean copper bason chained on the outside. There were also apertures over the doors as in the other court. The rooms in both courts are for the poor. At all my visits I observed every thing remarkably neat and clean. Over the rooms of the first court, there are larger rooms for those whose friends can pay for them. Common visitants are not allowed to go up: but, injudiciously, every one that pays four stivers is admitted below. — The windows all open to the court, none outwards.

I visited the pest-house, and several hospitals for the sick; but shall only observe in general the impropriety of keeping the patients too warm, by placing their beds, with woollen curtains, in small recejfes (or cupboards) in the walls *. The women's ward in the gast-huys, which was formerly a church, is an exception. This is lofty and spacious, with windows opposite to one another and a stone floor and though full of patients, it was not in the least offensive.

In the Orphan-house at Amsterdam there were about thirteen hundred children of both sexes, June 10, 1783. The rooms for the directors and the kitchen

were neat and clean; but the bed-rooms were close and unhealthy, being crowded with beds with three or four children for each bed. The infirmaries^were situated on the ground-floor; and the beds in them with two or three children in each

enclosed in boxes in the walls. For want of air, the work-rooms, schooFrooms

and refectories were so unhealthy and offensive, that the children here (as in three

other orphan-houses in this city, and in the orphan-house at Rotterdam) are indeed objects of great companion. Many of the servants in these houses are old and indolent; the children miserably nasty, and most of them troubled with scorbutic and cutaneous disorders to a great degree. On observing this to some of the directors, they replied in words that gave me pain and excited my indignation, "It

This unhealthy mode of placing the beds, is general in the houses of the common people in Holland.

is the house disorder; all our children must have a seasoning." Thus do the physicians and governors excuse the abuse of their trust. The consequence must be, that few of the children reach manhood, and that such as do, are a feeble and sickly race.

In the prison at Leeuwarden several were confined for petty offences; but there has been no execution for fourteen years past.

At my former visit there were thirty-four men in the Rasp-houJey and in November 1781 there were forty-five. A few of them were rasping logwood with an instrument composed of ten saws: others combing and spinning black wool: others spinning twine, weaving sacks, and coarse linen cloth, &c. At their leisure they make shoe-pegs, tobacco-stoppers, sugar-saucers of brass wire, &c. and sell them to visitants. In the Spin-house adjoining, were thirty-six women, and in November 1781, twenty-nine: all at work, preparing thread, spinning, &c. except one, whom the mistress going up with me from her breakfast found idle in a warehouse; and not only chided her for it sufficiently, but entertained me with her murmurs upon the offence a good while after; from whence I concluded the fault was not a very common one.

For the refractory, here are two closets, the bottoms and sides of which are pieces of wood placed edgeways, where being confined without shoes, they must be in a painful situation.

In the prison for the Military at Groningen there were two prisoners. The gallows joins to the prison.

There is also here a prison for the province. On the gallows, which is placed on elevated ground at a distance from the town, a criminal was hanging (November 1781) who had been executed the year before. In this country malefactors are often thus left to hang after execution, till they drop into a well (or deep pit) underneath, which is designed for the reception of their bones.

Over the gate of the Rcjp and Spin-house3 there is the following inscription: Vitiorum Jemma — otiura lab ore exhauriendum. Anno 1664.

On the ground-floor are four rooms for men. In each is an aperture two feet by three and a half into the wool-warehouse above. These were lately made by the advice of a judicious physician (Professor Camper) who thought the men's rooms not sufficiently airy, though they have opposite windows; the men sleeping as well as working in them: on which account they are still somewhat offensive. Women have a work-room and a lodging-room quite, separate; both of them very clean. All the prisoners v/ere employed in spinning wool. In November 1781 there were nineteen men and thirteen women. Here is a small chapel, in which the women fit on benches: and the men have an opening in their room opposite to the pulpit.

In the prison at Zwolle in Overyflel there were no felons, nor has there been an execution there for many years.

The house of correction (Hucht-huys) erected in 1735,^a neat building situated on the ramparts. In November 1781 there were in it seventeen men and twenty-six women. There is an iron latticed door in the front, and over it the device of a dragon chained. This and another door open into a court, on two sides of which are rooms for the men. In each of these I saw three or four prisoners, and they all slept as well as worked in their rooms *. On the other two sides are the keeper's apartments, in which the windows are properly placed to overlook the court. The women were on the first floor in two separate work-rooms, spinning and knitting. Nine of them who had been branded were working in a room by themselves; and they had also a separate lodging-room. The men were spinning, except two who were weaving,' and had their door open into the court.

As I examined this prison at the desire of Professor Camper, who thought it one of the best in Holland, I here give the plan of it.

At Utrecht, in 1776, no prisoners in the Stadt-house; in 1778, no debtors, and only one criminal, and his offence not capital: in 1781, no debtors; and but five offenders, two of whom were to be confined to bread and water; and in June 1783, only three prisoners. There has not been an execution for the city or province these twenty years. The allowance for debtors, the first week, is twenty-eight stivers a day; the second week, sixteen; and every day afterwards, eight stivers f. The state allows criminals thirteen stivers a day, which are paid to the gaoler. For, as he told me, " confinement here is not meant as punishment; but only as safe custody till " trial J. After which, some who are to be punished by a short imprisonment are sent ff to another prison, where they live on bread and water only." He said a woman who had been his prisoner, was that day sentenced to be so punished for a fortnight: but he added, " She will have a sufficient quantity; and if she be ill, her food will be Cf altered."

I went over the Spin-house with Mr. Van Goens} one of the magistrates, to whose kindness I am indebted for the following account of the instructions to the keeper. In this house, at a former visit, were thirty-seven men, and thirty-four women. They were all employed in carding and spinning wool, and knitting. The men were three in a room. The women were separated, according to their crimes. — In October 1781, there were fifty men and twenty-six women. Nine women who had been publicly whipped, had a work-room and bed-room separate from the rest. In June

See Professor Camper s alteration at Groningen, page 63.

f In the Ferbeterhuixen a gradation is also observed in the alimentary allowance.

t The same observation I remember was made to me by the keeper at Nimeguen, where the allowance is ten stivers. There were no prisoners.

1783, there were twenty-five men, and thirty-six women, thirty of the women in one room, and six in another.

The overseer or keeper has a house for the residence of himself and his family, and an annual salary of a thousand guilders from the dates,' and a hundred and thirty from the city, clear of all deductions. According to the copy of instructions, he must not be absent a night out of the city, without leave from the chief officer and the regents. He must, with assistants, search every part of the cells twice a week, to see whether any thing be done — attempted — or introduced, that is not permitted: and he must carefully inspect all things that are conveyed to the prisoners, that no tools, or glass, no gin or other Jirong liquors may be concealed: and he must himself, or one of his family, be present when any persons come to see the house, and no more than six visitants are to be admitted at one time. He must see that the provisions for the prisoners be good; and take care that the manufacturer pays the same for their work, as he would if he employed others. He must confine those condemned for a long term, in strong rooms separate from the rest. He may correct moderately; but if the prisoners are refractory, and deserve severer punishment, he must inform the regents. By a particular permission from the magistrates, he may take in as boarders, persons of bad behaviour, at the desire of their parents, guardians or relations. — The regents only can appoint, or discharge, a servant, or turnkey.

Leewenberch Gast-huys3 in the suburbs of the city, was endowed (as appears by an inscription upon it) by a lady of that name for a pest-house, and built in 1567. I choose to give a plan and description of it, because I think it capable of being improved into a model for a good county hospital. There is an ascent of two steps into the vestibule, which has two folding-doors on both sides, and windows over them, and a staircase to rooms above. On the sides of an extensive passage there are four spacious wards, thirty feet high. A part of one of these has been converted into a kitchen; and in each of the other three there are twelve beds. They have galleries for opening the windows; and two flues from each chimney meet over the middle windows. Like the hospitals in Italy there are no rooms over the wards; this is a circumstance very -favourable to the health of the patients. The floors consist of square bricks, and are supported by strong pillars and arches ten feet wide. From the rooms over the vestibule is the entrance to an open gallery (eight feet wide) over the paflsage, from which all the wards may be seen. By opening the opposite doors, this house may be always kept cool and frefti. It is one of the driest I ever visited. The rain-water is conducted from the roof through vaults built on the outside of the wards, to prevent them from being offensive.

At Deventer, the prison is near the river Iflel. It consists of four, rooms, which were all clean and sanded, but had no prisoners. When there are any, sixteen ftjyers a day are paid for each; which the gaoler receives, as at moil other' towns.

Prisoners for capital offences are removed to the Stadt-house, where the same allowance continued.

I leave this country with regret, as it affords a large field for information on the important subject I have in view. I know not which to admire moll, the neatness and cleanliness appearing in the prisons, the industry and regular conduct of the prisoners, or the humanity and attention of the magistrates and regents*.

GERMANY.

The Germans, well aware of the necessity of cleanliness in prisons, have very judiciously chosen to build them in situations most conducive to it; that is, near rivers: as at Hanover, Zell, Hamburg, Berlin, Bremen, Cologn, Mentz, and many other places.

In the gaols that I first saw, there were but few prisoners, except those calied, improperly, galley-slaves. One cause of this, is a speedy trial after commitment.

The galley-slaves have every where a prison to themselves. They work on the roads, the fortifications, chalk-hills, and other public service; for four, seven, ten, fifteen, twenty years, according to their crimes: and are clothed, as well as fed, by the government. At Wefel, which belongs to the King of Prussia, there were ninety-eight of these Haves: they have two pounds of bread a day, and the value of three halfpence every day they work.

I saw but a very few under-ground dungeons in any new prisons abroad; in Germany none, except at Liege. At Lunenburg the dungeons are disused: and instead of them are built additional rooms up stairs; one for each prisoner. And in many of the gaols each criminal is alone in his room; which is more or less strong, lightsome, and airy, as the crime he is charged with is more or less atrocious.

One often fees the doors of sundry rooms marked Ethiopia, India, Italy, France, England, &c. In those rooms, parents, by the authority of the magistrates, confine for a certain term dissolute children: and if they are inquired after, the answer is, they are gone to Italy, England, &c.

I do not remember any prison in Germany (nor elsewhere abroad) in which felons have not, either from the public allowance, or from charities, somewhat more to

I should accuse myself of ingratitude, did not I take this occasion again to express my acknowledgments to Sir Joseph Yorke; who, not only exerted himself with ardour to promote the success of my inquiries; but while I was confined at the Hague in consequence of an accident, favoured me with instances of kindness and friendship that I never can forget.

live on than bread and water. In some places a person goes on market-days with a basket for prisoners: and I have seen him bring them a comfortable meal of fresh vegetables. But there are separate prisons, in which confinement for a week or two on bread and water is all the punishment for some petty offences. Perhaps, when a condemned criminal is only to live a day or two, such diet may be more proper than the indulgence with which the Germans, and other foreigners treat prisoners after sentence of death, which is commonly executed within forty-eight hours. The malefactor has then his choice of food, and wine, in a commodious room, into which his friends are admitted} and a minister attends him during almost all his remaining hours.

I went into Germany in June 1778, by Osnabrug and Hanover. The prison at Osnabrug I should entirely omit, did I not entertain a hope, that the account of it may possibly engage the notice of an amiable Prince who is the present bijhof, and so be the means of alleviating the sufferings of the miserable prisoners. The prison and the house of correction is one large building, situated in an airy part of the suburbs, near a brook. A Latin inscription over the gate implies, that it was erected " at the public expence, in 1756, for the purposes of public justice and utility, by confining and punishing the wicked." — There are seventeen chambers for criminals, which have no light but by a small aperture over each door. I was happy to find here no more than one prisoner. He had been confined three years, and had survived the cruelty of the torture *. In another fart of the house I found many miserable and sickly objects, men, women and children, almost all without shoes and stockings. They were spinning in different rooms, which were dirty beyond description. These rooms open into an offensive passage, which a gentleman in office in the city, to whom I was recommended, durst not enter. I inquired of the keeper concerning several particulars in the diet, &c. but the misery expressed in the countenances of the prisoners, made me totally disregard the information given me By words.

At Bremen the tower, or prison for debtors, has four rooms; but in 1776 the magistrate who accompanied me. Dr. Hanewinkel, assured me not one of them had been occupied for above thirty years, till very lately; when one was fitted up for a debtor, who was confined in it a few weeks. In 1781 I found it still remained unoccupied. — Over the door of this prison is inscribed.

Hie fraudum terminus ejlo.

That there were few debtors, or none at all, in such towns as Mentz, Coblentz, Manheim, &c. may be aferibed to their being places of but little trade. In such

The mode of torture here is more excruciating than in most other countries, and is known by the name of the Osnabrug torture. I doubt not but the humanity and good sense of his royal highness, will abolish it when he comes of as*e.

large trading cities as Hamburg, and Bremen, it seems owing to the little credit that is given — the expence of aliment &c. falling on the creditor — the being separated from their families, and deprived of every kind of amusement and diversion while in prison — and the disgrace of being the re.

Debtors are not permitted, in any German cities that I have seen, to have their wives and children living with them in prison.

In 1781 I was obliged to apply to the magistrates for permission to visit the prisons, one of the keepers having lately been confined fourteen days to bread and water, for suffering a townsman to converse with a prisoner.

The Gaol is a tower at one of the gates. In the lower part there are four strong rooms (or cells) about thirteen feet four inches by six feet eight, and six feet high. The doors are four feet ten inches high and five inches thick, with iron plates between the boards. The windows are only small apertures (fourteen inches by nine). I found a prisoner in the same cell in which I had seen him five years before. Fie had made his escape, but had been retaken. — There has been no execution in this city for twenty-six years.

In another Prison down ten steps from the street, there are six rooms for criminals without windows. One was six feet nine inches by four feet and a half, and seven feet high: another was ten feet by five and a half, and six feet high. The allowance is six sous (3id.) a day, but there were no prisoners. In this dismal abode, one had lately beat himself to death against the wall, which was stained with his blood.

At the Clock-tower there are several rooms for petty offenders, whose diet is only bread and water; the allowance three sous (ifd.) a day. But their term of confinement is seldom longer than fix, eight, or fourteen days.

The House of correction situated on the Weser is indeed a house of industry; and very quiet. In 1776 there were eleven men and twenty-eight women, and in 1781, nine men and nineteen women, all at work; except a woman who had broke her leg. The stronger and less docile men rasp logwood: others weave a set talk of hair carpets &c. The keeper appoints a weaver in the house to instruct every new comer, who generally teaches him the art in a short time. — The women's apartments were very clean; their work is spinning cows and goats hair, knitting See. — The diet of the men differed from that of the women only in quantity; two men were in a mess, and three women. They have meat only on Sundays and great holidays. — The keeper has a salary, and sells nothing. — The prisoners defeend by a trap-door into the gallery of the church, where the men and women are separated, and have wooden balustrades before them.

This church belongs to an adjoining poor-house (Stat armen' haus) in which there is a number of clean rooms opening into passages seven feet wide, and large enough to hold four beds in each. The number of poor in these rooms was one hundred and eighty, about eighty of whom were knitting, spinning and sewing in a

Sect. IV. GERMANY. 69

large work-room. The regulations for the conduct of the house were hung up in the refectory. The poor are here liberally accommodated in the decline of life; and their cheerful countenances cannot but give great pleasure to all who visit them. — Above stairs is a neat apothecary's shop, and a room for the inspectors which opens into the church, and in which are inscribed the names, of the inspectors from 1712, and of the deacons from 1698.

Not long since this city was remarkable for the number of children begging in the streets but a Work-house has been lately established for the purpose of employing the m; and here, in two rooms, I saw about one hundred and seventy, from six to nine years of age, spinning (with small wheels) under proper matters and mistresses. They are allowed at least twelve sous (6|d.) a week, and all were clean, and seemed cheerful and happy; but were not allowed either diet or lodging in the house. The benefits arising from clearing the streets of such a nuisance have induced the inhabitants of other places, to make inquiries concerning this useful plan.

The Orders and regulations are hung up in the house, and consist of nineteen articles, from which I have made the following extracts.

ARTICLE

I. The children must not come into the house without their heads combed, and their hands and face washed. For the first neglect they are reprimanded, for the second punished.

II. Parents mud keep their children quite clean.

III. The children must obey their governors.

IV. They must endeavour to learn well and quick.

V. Work begins in the morning from six to eight, according to the length of the day; and in the afternoon always at one.

VI. One hour after they have begun work they are to be called over, hear prayers, and ling a hymn.

VII. to XIII. Direct the punishment to be inflicted for not attending regularly, and their treatment in case of sickness.

XIV. Orders the punishments for swearing, injuring others, and damaging the work.

XV. Relates to the conduct of parents who hinder their children from regular attendance, in this house or at school.

XVI. Declares the peculiar attention the magistrates will give to those parents, &c. who bring up their children in the fear of God, and in obedience to these regulations.

XVII. to XIX. Describe the rewards to children for their attention and diligence.

The contributions to defray the expence of this useful institution are voluntary; and a collection for this purpose is made from house to house, every week. No subscription is taken less than one groschen per week; and the greatest subscription is thirty-six grosche a week.

I sat an afternoon with Dr. Duntze of Bremen, who told me he was in London in 1753 and 54, with an inquisitive friend, a German. They went into Newgate to observe the effects of the ventilator; and were struck with an offensive smell in one of the rooms. Next day they were both indisposed. The Doctor's complaint turned out a kind of jaundice. After a few days confinement he visited his friend, and found him excessively low; and in a ftiort time he died with every symptom of the gaol-fever.

Hanover Prison.

House of Correction.

The Prison at Hanover was built about thirty years ago on the banks of the river Leyna; and consists of twenty-six rooms for confinement. The lower rooms have double doors, with large apertures over them guarded by double iron bars. These openings being opposite to the windows afford the prisoners the only fresh air they are allowed. Their beds are solid {tone, a little elevated above the floor, and higher at the head than the feet, with straw on them and two coverlets. In winter the rooms are warmed by stoves, but being too near the water, and lower than the street, they must be unhealthy, and this appears from the countenances of the prisoners. The upper rooms are larger apartments for debtors, &c. When I visited this prison in 1776, I found in it one debtor and seven criminals; in 1778, two debtors and three criminals; and in October 1781, there were twenty-nine prisoners, many of whom had been confined a year, and others six months, without being brought to trial. Seven or eight of them were women, some of whom had been committed with their husbands, but lodged in different rooms. The allowance to all is the same, two marien grosche (or i\d.) per day. Seven of the lower rooms are for the more atrocious criminals. At my last visit I found seven prisoners (one in each room) secured by chains on their feet fattened to the walls, and irons on their wrists with a bar between, two feet long. The keeper is allowed a salary, and sells no liquor. He is old and infirm, and the prison grows evidently dirtier as he grows older. — A guard of six soldiers and an officer is stationed here day and night, who are relieved every morning at eight, and do duty alternately by taking two hours trufi and four repose, so that each soldier is on guard eight out of the twenty-four hours. — The various edicts for regulating this prison are put into frames, and hung in the council-chamber.

The execrable practice of torturing prisoners is here used, in a cellar where the horrid engine is kept. The time for it is, as in other countries, about two o'clock in the morning. A criminal suffered the Osnabrug torture twice about two years ago; the latt time, at putting to him the third question (the executioner having torn off the hair from his head, breast, &c.) he confefied, and was executed. On such occasions a counsellor and secretary attend, with a doctor and furgedn, an Osnabrug executioner, and sometimes the gaoler. If the criminal faints, strong salts are here applied to him, and not vinegar, as in some other places.

The House of correction is a new building in an airy situation, appropriated to vagrants, children and petty offenders. Here were ninety-four prisoners, fifty-eight of whom were' children, clothed in a neat uniform of blue and Miite linfey-woolfey made in the house. The girls were all spinning cotton and linen. The boys, in some rooms were carding, and spinning wool and linen, and making lift ftioes and carpets. In one room there were six boys (the eldest only twelve years of age) working at so many small looms for faddle girths and clothes. In two other rooms there was a number of women employed in spinning. There are also two small rooms for

harder work, such as rasping logwood and harts-horn. The coverlets of all the beds had been made in the house. Besides their own clothes, &c. the prisoners here make girths, flippers and lift carpets for sale, specimens of which I brought with me. The orders for regulating the hours of work, learning, recreation, &c. were hung up in the school-room. Both old and young were neat and clean 5 and every thing in the house appeared quiet and orderly.

This institution, of only two years standing, does great honour to the founder and director Mr. burgomaster Alemann, and is the best monument that can ever be erected for him. A good choice has been made of proper persons to preside, and inspectj which is a circumstance of the greatest importance in such houses*.

In the town-house at Brunswick there are several rooms of confinement for citizens, but they, were unoccupied.

The tower, or prison for capital offences, is over one of the gates. It consists of three rooms, but none of them had been occupied for a considerable time. There had been no execution for fourteen years.

In the prison for the slaves, the barracks were without beds. They had heavy irons, and at a former visit their countenances were unhealthy. But in October 1781, they appeared healthy and clean, and were furnished with shoes, stockings and proper clothing. The irons were fixed round their waists and shoulders, and not their legs. My visit being on Sunday, I observed that their barrows, which had all chains on the handles, were ranged on the outside of the house, ready for work the next day.

The work-house, or House of correction, stands near the river that runs through the city. In October 1781, there were here about seventy prisoners, who are always locked up. On the first and second floor the men and women sleep in boxes in the passages. In the work-rooms (it being Sunday) I was much surprised to find them all (except some lunatics in chains) employed in carding and spinning. This accounted for the keeper's preventing me from seeing them at chapel, by saying no person was admitted. I was however admitted after the service, and concluded from the sand on the floor at the prisoners benches, that few or none had attended. My conductor infilled on carrying a pan of charcoal through the rooms* but his fumigation could not overcome the offen-fiveness of this dirty house.

On one of the doors, both within and without, was hung up the following order, dated December 12, 1748. " That decent people may inspect the house — but no

" more than four at a time — that they mud put a florin (2s. 6d.) into the box, for the prisoners whose term is expired, to afiifl: them in passing on their journey, and <c prevent them from begging or stealing. — Lastly, nothing must be given to the " keepers, or to the prisoners confined for punishment."

At Zell, in the deflorate of Hanover, is a large work-house or house of correction.

At Lunenburg, I found the convicts employed on a different work from any I had before seen; digging stone from a large chalk-hill: others were preparing it for the kiln, grinding, fisting, packing &c. in the warehouses. The calks are about three hundred weight. It is sent to Hamburg and other distant places, as it makes an excellent cement. Many other men were employed, but the criminals, of whom there were thirty one, had a chain of about four pounds. Their allowance was one pound and a half of bread, and three halfpence in money: provisions much cheaper than in England.

At Harburg there were thirteen slaves working on the fortifications, with irons on one leg, and chains supported by girdles round their waists. Their allowance is three halfpenny worth of ammunition bread, and five farthings a day. They are guarded by soldiers, who have orders to fire on them if they attempt to escape. But, notwithstanding this, when the Elbe was frozen over (1780) five escaped to Hamburg.

In the great and opulent city of Hamburg in 1776, I visited all the prisons with every advantage, through the kindness of my friend, Senator Voght. In the Buttuley the felons were all in irons. The common method of execution is decollation. The executioner (who is gaoler) fire wed me the sword kept for this purpose, telling me he had made use of it eight times. Here is no court-yard, and only one day-room on the ground-floor. Above stairs, there are six or eight strong rooms about ten feet square. Allowance for each prisoner is four marks a week (a mark is. 3d.). Divine service is constantly performed on Sundays and Thursdays. — In 1781, there were only two criminals and one debtor. I saw them at chapel, and they seemed very attentive and much affected. The prison was clean: but I perceived by the countenance of the gaoler and his unwillingness to shew me again the torture-room, that he had seen my publication. For among the various engines of torture, or the question, which I have seen in France, Italy, Germany, and other places, one of the most excruciating is kept and used in a deep cellar of this prison. It ought to be buried ten thousand fathom deeper *. It is said the inventor was the first who suffered by it: the last was a woman, a few years ago.

The Werk-und Tucht-haus is a work-house situated near the Alster, and designed for the reception of the poor — beggars — and petty offenders. Confinement in it is not reckoned infamous. The rooms are fifteen feet wide, and have opposite windows. The inhabitants were knitting and spinningj weaving stockings, linen, hair, and

wool; — and rasping logwood and hartshorn; (the talk of logwood to a strong man is forty-five pounds per day.) Some men and horses worked at a fulling-mill; and a smith was in constant employment. At a former visit I saw in the great room about three hundred women and girls; and in 1781 the whole number in the house was about six hundred. There is kept a regular account of the earnings, of the amount of which each person receives one-fourth.

I was happy to find, at my last visit, a great alteration in the countenances of the inhabitants, and in the Hate of the house, as to cleanliness. It is governed by eight directors (or regents) who must be married men. They meet every Saturday in a room appropriated to them, to examine, and give orders. There is also a room for their ladies, who meet at the same time to deliver out the women's work; and too much cannot be said in praise of their care and attention.

In the chapel, the men have a room below, and the women above. An hour is spent in the service here every morning.

There are several dark rooms for the confinement of the refractory (thirteen feet by four feet nine inches,) over which are the names Ethiopia, India, London, &c. — There is a spacious and convenient kitchen and bake-house. But the sick rooms both for the men and women are too small.

In the room where the regents meet are their names and arms; and also the regulations, which Mr. Fan Hafel, one of the regents, was so kind as to give me, together with a look containing an account of the institution, reprinted in 1766 from the original in 1622.

This book contains — instructions for the governors — orders for the officers of the house (such as steward, school-master, task-master, clerk, rasp-master, turnkey, and porter) — and regulations for the management of the poor, and of such as have been committed for offences.

The Steward is to ring a bell every morning at five, (Sundays excepted) as a signal for the officers, the poor, &c. to rife and prepare for prayers. He is then to deliver the keys to the turnkey. He and his wife are to distribute the meals, and to see that all in the house are properly instructed as to moral and religious duties. They are required to establish and preserve good order and harmony among the other officers. The steward must not permit the poor, or the wives, children and servants of the other officers, to converse with such as are confined for offences, or to buy or sell any thing for them.

The School-mafxer must: instruct the' children in religion, and encourage them, at proper times, to learn and repeat portions of Scripture. He must: also teach them, reacting, writing and accounts, and a decent behaviour to those that visit the house. He must take care that they attend divine service, and are orderly at it; and his wife, with the wives of the other officers, are required to examine the rooms, in order to guard against mischief, and wicked contrivances, and the danger of fire.

The Tajk-master on Monday morning must give every person a particular talk for the week, and on Saturday take an account of it. In giving their talks, attention must be paid to the trade in which they had been employed, and to their ability and skill. — The talk-master is not permitted to undertake any work, either by himself or his wife, for his own private advantage. — His wife has the care of all the linen of the house; and to see it regularly delivered, 8tc.

The Clerk must keep an exact account, of the receipts, and expenditure, of all the money, and materials — for work — provisions — and furniture.

The Rasp-master and the Turnkey have the care of the criminals — to conduct therm to, and from their work — to prepare their wood and tools, and to serve them with provisions. Every Saturday the Rasp-master must see that all their rooms are swept and thoroughly walked. He is never to go abroad without being permitted by the steward, and delivering to him the keys. He must avoid all familiarity in conversing with the criminals. The talk-master with the rasp-master, must carefully visit. the bed-rooms of the prisoners two or three times every week, and examine their, bedding and straw, and every Saturday get all the rooms thoroughly cleansed.

The Porter must not suffer any of the poor to go out, without leave, and obtaining a leaden (lamp from the steward. He must stand before the doors of the bed-rooms, of the criminals while they pass to their work-rooms in the morning, and also when they return in the everting.

The Poor are not allowed to be absent all night, or to bring in company. Such, of them as have learned to work, and appear to be reformed and industrious, are. on their humble petition to be discharged.

When prisoners are brought in, they must be examined and washed, and if necessary, clothed. Every Saturday afternoon they are to be dismissed from work to clean themselves and wash their rooms, and the court: after which they are to receive clean shirts, and every four or six weeks, clean bed linen.

Absence from prayers — swearing, curling, lying and cheating — quarelling, or seeing others quarrel and fight without giving notice to the steward or school--master — are punished by fine, or forfeiture. All who commit any violence, or attempt an escape, together with those who abet or conceal them, are punished by a prolongation of their term of confinement, if not in some other way. Such as refuse to work, are to be punished with short allowance, or with stripes; and for a continued refusal, must be ignominiously exposed or put into the pillory. After, an escape they are recommitted and punished; but for the second escape they are banished from the city and territory.

I observed in the table of diet, that the poor are allowed no meat, except on the great festivals. At their meals they are allowed rye bread, and at breakfast butter with it. At dinner and supper they are allowed peeled barley, oats or buck-wheat hot, with milk (which in that city is remarkably good). The logwood-rafpers and hemp beaters, are allowed a double quantity of bread and butter. — The sick are

Sect. IV. DENMARK. 75

allowed a better diet, confining of white bread, beer, soup or meat, just as ordered by the physician.

In the Spin-house, (confinement in which is accounted infamous), the men were employed in spinning, in more lightsome rooms than those of the other house. In 1776, there were seventy-three prisoners, and in 1781, fifty-two.

Here, as at some other towns, is a prison for flight offences (Roken-Kijle). The punishment to be confined for three or four days to two or three weeks, and live on bread and water only. To prevent the prisoners having any thing else, what money they bring with them is taken and sealed up; but it is returned to them when discharged.

The Hospital for the sick (formerly the pest-house) stands in the suburbs. The wards being crowded with beds, the ceilings low, and the windows kept shut in the warmest days, it may properly now be called a pejl-house.

In this city, supposed to contain ninety thousand souls, there were but three debtors in 1776, and but one in 1781*: and in the neighbouring town Altena, which belongs to the king of Denmark, there were but two the first time, and one the last.

At the entrance of many towns in Denmark, a whipping-post stands conspicuous; on the top of which the figure of a man is placed with a sword by his side, and a whip in his right hand.* Gibbets and wheels are also placed on eminences, on which the bodies of malefactors are sometimes left after execution, to deter others from their crimes.

* I here copy a few articles from the code of municipal laws. " Aucun citoyen ne put ni etre tc emprisonne, ni aucune peine lui infligee fans jugement prealable de fes pairs, pourvu qu'il donnat " caution & que le crime ne fut pas capital. Quiconque s'etait enfui, s'etait mis hors de la protection " des loix.

+ Would not some public intimations of the punishment to follow crimes be useful also in England? notwithstanding the numbers of fishermen and loose boys about Amsterdam, the Hague, and Schevelin, their public walks and beautiful plantations remain uninjured; which is owing, partly to the strictness of the police, and partly to the warnings given by placarts painted on boards, and hung up in different places, with representations of whipping, cutting off hands, &c.

Criminals

76 FOREIGN PRISONS.

Criminals are never put into irons before their trial, unless when they are apprehended in the act of murder, or some other very atrocious crime. After condemnation, application is made to parliament, which either confirms, or reverses the sentence pronounced.

Some criminals are punished by being whipped in the market-place, and banished. Some of the lower sort, as watchmen, coachmen, &c. are punished by being led through the city in what is called the Spanish mantle. This is a kind of heavy vest, something like a tub, with an aperture for the head, and irons to enclose the neck. I measured one at Berlin, one foot eight inches diameter at the top, two feet eleven at the bottom, and two feet eleven inches high. In order to convey a clearer idea of it, I have represented it in a drawing. This mode of punishment is particularly dreaded, and is one cause that night-robberies are never heard of in Copenhagen.

The place of execution is out of the City. Decollation is reckoned more honourable by the sword than by the axe. This is the common mode of execution; but of some more heinous crimes the punishment is breaking on the wheels and in executing this on state prisoners, it has been the practice sometimes to begin with cutting off their right hands. — After the sentence of a criminal is confirmed, he is allowed time to prepare for death, from eight to fourteen days, as the chaplain attending him thinks necessary. He is confined in a cell (or dungeon) at night, but is allowed to be in an upper room in the day.

Executions are rare. A great number for child-murder are condemned to work in spin-houses for life, and to be whipped annually on the day when, and the spot where, the crime was committed. This mode of punishment is dreaded more than death, and since it has been adopted has greatly prevented the frequency of the crime. — The punishment for grand-larceny has been, since 1771, whipping and slavery for life.

[Rendsburg.]

At Rendsburg in Holstein, in the guard-room at the entrance of the prison, on a slate was a list of seventy-seven slaves; sixty well, and seventeen sick. They are distinguished by a brown coat, with red sleeves, and irons on one leg, with a chain fastened to their waists. They work on the fortifications; in summer from five to eleven, and from one to six. Their bread was coarse and black, and seemed by the taste, to be made of buck-wheat. Besides an allowance of bread, they have a pay of one stiver (a penny) a day.* They lie on barrack beds. Their countenances were more clear and healthy than those of the common people, postillions, &c. who have opportunities of procuring spirituous liquors.

[Copenhagen.]

At Copenhagen, the State-prison is in the citadel. In this prison there are five or six rooms, about fifteen feet by fourteen, with one window, and a case (or bed)

in each. These rooms were clean and white-washed. I observed here one prisoner, who was guarded by an officer and soldier in the room, and another at the door, though the guard-room was below. The weather being then very warm, (thermometer 77°.) he was permitted to have his window open: and this is all the fresh air allowed state-prisoners, for they are never suffered to go out of their rooms. The king makes them an ample allowance for diet; At the time of divine service, their doors are opened, and they hear it by an oblique perforation into the church, through the thick wall opposite to the doors.

I observed chains fastened to the wall, in the close rooms, where the Counts Struensee and Brandt had been confined*. — Here are some dark rooms for the punishment of soldiers, but no dungeons.
---
In the prison at the Stat-house (Stadens arreji-hus) there were nine persons confined for crimes, and eleven for debt. The female criminals were at work in their several apartments, which I observed to be clean: but the rooms of the male criminals were dirty and offensive. The allowance granted them is three marks (27 pence) a week. There are in this prison several arched damp dungeons. — A resident chaplain reads prayers to the prisoners every day.

The Blue-tower (the prison for the bailiwick and servants of the court) consists of four small rooms, on three floors. There were in it eight men and two women: their allowance is two pence a day, with which they purchase what they please of the gaoler, who keeps a public house, and has a salary from the court. Here, as well as in the prison at the Stat-house, I could not but observe the neatness of the women, whose rooms were a contrail to those of the men-f. The reason is, that the gaolers wives inspect the apartments of their own sex, and are more attentive than their husbands.

The StoB-hause is near the ramparts. Here criminals from the garrison, and convicts from the different classes of the people, are condemned to slavery. On one side of the court belonging to this prison, there are two rooms on the ground-floor, each of which, though only ten feet high, has two tiers of barrack-beds. These rooms, being crowded, are unhealthy. Over them there are two close rooms for the sick; and also a chapel, which has no gallery, the ceiling being very low. Here I saw a hundred and forty-three Haves, who were distinguished by a brown coat with red sleeves, and breeches likewise of both colours. They never put off their clothes at night; and as they have new clothes only once in two years, and those very flight, I did not wonder to find many of them almoll naked. Some had light chains on one leg, some heavier chains on both legs; others had iron coliars: one was

chained by his wrists to a wheel-barrow. These, I understood, were punishments infiidted upon those of them who had attempted to escape, &c*.

On the other side of the court, and down ten Heps, there are seven arched dungeons about fifteen feet by seven, with one window eighteen inches by twelve, in which were eleven prisoners, who lay on barrack-beds.

The distress and despair in the pale and sickly countenances of the slaves were shocking to humanity. My first visit was on Saturday; the next day I went to the service at the chapel, where, of the few that attended, the man chained to the r wheel-barrow was one. They fat together on benches, and soldiers were properly placed at different parts of the chapel, and two with bayonets fixed, flood at the door. Service being ended, the slaves first passed down. I then revisited their rooms, where most of them lay on barracks, dirty beyond description. At my third visit, I found the prison put into better order, and swept. The offensiveness of this prison always gave me a head-ach, such as I suffered from my first visits to the JEngliJJj prisons.

These slaves work on the fortifications, and their time for working in summer, is from five to eleven, and from one to fix. Their allowance is seven pounds of black bread every five days, besides a pay of one stiver a day in winter, and in summer, when they work more hours, a stiver and half. They were attended by a guard consisting of twenty soldiers. In returning from their work, I observed that some of them were chained to one another in pairs with loose chains. These, I found, were some of the worst, who had passed under the hands of an executioner and were branded; on a slate fifty eight in this class; and eighty-five, of the first class.

In the Spin-house there were about three or four hundred prisoners sorting, carding, and spinning wool, for the king's manufactory in this city -f. The rooms are spacious, but notwithstanding this they are close and offensive, the windows being kept shut. In the court I saw several small rooms, with one man in each, employed in either rasping or chopping logwood. Sixty-six women were confined for life J, and all employed in carding and spinning in one room. — Separate rooms are assigned to the sick. The surgeon told me he apprehended one woman had the gaol-fever; but this probably was a mistake, for upon examining her pulse I found it strong and quick.

I observed in the windows of this and two other prisons, an iron ring, of about three inches diameter, on all the bars where they cross each other at right angles, to prevent their brdng wrenched out.

+ The King's military cloth manufactory was built in 1760. It is four hundred and twenty-five feet long, and employs from five to six hundred persons. All the wool spun in the several houses of correction in the Danish dominions is brought to this manufactory. Great quantities, especially of the finer fort intended for clothes for the officers, are spun in the house here described.

In the Aimindelige or great hospital, there are near a thousand poor. The length of one of the wings is two hundred and seventy-five feet.

every story, by a gallery open on the sides; which prevents the floors from being offensive. The passages of the several floors open into the galleries of the chapel, which is in the centre. The chaplain has six rooms and a kitchen. He officiates on Sundays, and has a salary of three hundred dollars a year, (a Danish dollar is 3J. gd.) besides some perquisites; but he has no other charge to attend. A clerk officiates at eight, every morning, and is allowed two dollars a week.

Frederick's Hospital, (or the royal infirmary,) is an elegant building, and has a spacious area, with pleasant walks for the patients. Many of the poor citizens are admitted and maintained gratis: others, on paying seven Danish marks (a mark nine-pence) a week, or if they have separate rooms, fourteen. Thirty soldiers may also be admitted, who, if single, are obliged to give up their whole pay to the hospital, and if married, half. The patients wear the clothes of the house. Each of them has a bed to himself; and their number was one hundred and forty-two men, and eighty-five women. Of these, one hundred and fifty-eight were under the care of the physician, and sixty-nine under the surgeon. Here, a proper separation is made between these two forts of patients. The wards are not crowded; and it is the custom to white-waflh them once every year. If this were universally practised in their hospitals and prisons, it would have a very beneficial effect. — The Diet table which was hung up in the wards was as follows.

Copenhagen.

The Marine Hospital contained one hundred and fifty-seven patients, separated from one another according to their different disorders. Their diet and regimen are the same as in Frederick's hospital. Their beds have no curtains; and in fine weather are carried out to be beat and aired. The wards are spacious, and care is taken to keep them cleanly, by washing them every week.

In the Hospital for the education of poor children, there were two hundred and twenty-five boys , almost all of whom had cutaneous disorders and sickly countenances. I found no proper management here, and the rooms were close and dirty. When the director shewed me the sick rooms, I told him, all the rooms were sick rooms.

In St. John's Hospital, which is the pest-house, and stands half a mile from the city, there were about a hundred men and two hundred women. In each of two of the wards there were ten or twelve small rooms for the insane. Though the weather was warm, the windows were shut; a circumstance peculiarly bad for that fort of patients. The chaplain, who resides here in a neat house, favoured me with his company through some of the wards. The windows, though opposite to one another, were of little use except for light. The house was clean; the floors fai.ded; and the beds neat. — This was formerly the military hospital which is now removed to Christian's Plege-buus, a spacious building in the city; one- of the quadrangles is the great poor-house just described. It is a well regulated establishment. The regulations were drawn up by Major de Pslug, who published them in 1773, with the plans of the building: for which scarce publication I am obliged to Mr. Trefchow, chaplain to the garrison

SWEDEN.

In travelling through the country in Sweden, I observed the houses to be much cleaner than those in Denmark; and this led me to hope I should find the same difference in the prisons; especially as I was told they were visited every Saturday by an officer from the chancery. But I was disappointed, for I found them as dirty and offensive as those in Denmark. Some of the prisons at Stockholm are near the water; the city, which stands on seven islands, being well adapted for that situation. When I attended at the trials in the court of justice in July, the want of fresh air, in consequence of the windows being shut, affected me so much as to make me ill a considerable time afterwards.

Stock- There are three prisons at Stockholm; one in the northern suburbs, one in die holm. southern, and the other in the city itself. Criminals while confined in these prisons, are not in irons. If the offence be capital, they are after condemnation sent to the great prison (called Smed-garden); from whence they may appeal to parliament, which must comfirm the sentence before it can be executed.

The general mode of execution is by the axe. Women are beheaded on a scaffold, which is afterwards set on fire at the four corners, and consumed with the body. The present King has humanely abolished all torture, and ordered a dark cellar applied to this purpose in the great prison, to be bricked up*.

I was present four or five hours in one of the courts of justice, when many civil and criminal causes were tried. The burgomaster (with his gold chain) was seated at one end of a table, and on each side four or five other magistrates. The manner of swearing a witness was by requiring him to put two fingers on a Bible, and to pronounce the words of the oath deliberately after the burgomaster. — In some causes only one witness was sworn; in others, several; and while one was under examination, the rest were not allowed to be present, except in trials for petty offences, when no oath was administered. — In civil causes, both plaintiffs and,defendants presented memorials, and some were allowed counsel. — In a prosecution of a man for beating his wife, I observed that one of the senior magistrates pleaded the wife's cause, and then withdrew with the parties concerned in the prosecution. The judge, having consulted a book of laws, called them in again; and after Itearing the law read and the sentence pronounced, they bowed and departed at

different doors. I observed in petty disputes, a reconciliation so hearty sometimes taking place, that the contending parties shook hands, and went off together shedding tears of joy.

[Norr Kiamnars Ratt.]

In the prison called Norr Kiamnars Ratt for the northern suburbs, (which are four times as large as the city itself) there are two justice-rooms and six other rooms. It had in it only three prisoners. The allowance, six stivers (3d.) per day.

[Soder Kiamnars Ratt.]

In the prison for the southern district Soder Kiamnars Ratt, there were also six rooms; four of which, having their windows nailed up, were very dark, dirty and offensive. Here were five prisoners almost stifled, in consequence of receiving no air except through a small aperture in the door of each room. The other two rooms were light and airy, and are sometimes used as an infirmary. — The gaoler here, as in the other prisons, sells liquors. His room, like those I have too often seen in my own country, was full of idle people who were drinking.

[Stads Kiamnars Ratt.]

In the prison for the city, called Stads Kiamnars Ratt, the rooms were very dirty, and the windows of all, except one, were shut. The countenances of the prisoners bespoke neglect and oppression. Here were two rooms appropriated to criminals condemned for a certain term, to bread and water. In one of these rooms there were two persons, who seemed almost starved, being allowed only six stivers worth of bread, (2d.) per day, and that sold them by an unfeeling gaoler*. Here is no chapel; nor are the prisoners ever allowed to leave their noxious cells. I observed coffins are kept ready for the dead.

[Smed-garden.]

The Smed-garden (to which criminals are sent after condemnation) is a brick building in an airy situation. It has a court enclosed with high planks, or palisades. In one of the rooms on one side of this court, I saw two barrack-beds and three men, one of them loaded with irons. Their allowance is six stivers per day, with which they may purchase what they please. Two stiver worth of bread weighed exactly twelve ounces.

On the other side of the court is the chapel, and the apartments of the women, where I saw five prisoners at needle-work, but none in irons; and, I was informed, the women are never put into irons. There is a bed in the chapel; where the convict rests till his execution, which is sometimes three weeks: two days before this, his irons are taken off.

The men are allowed to walk in the court from eight to nine, and from four to five: the women are allowed the same privilege, but at different times.

[Debtors Prison.]

The Prison for debtors is in the city, and consists of two rooms on the first floor and two over them. Here were sixteen men, and one woman. The rooms being

* Seeing these miserable objects thankful for a small donation of bread, I said to the gaoler, "a sentence for twenty-eight days must be very severe." He replied, "it is good for their health." I can make a good conjecture of the state of a prison, from the countenances of the prisoners: complacency and submission appear under kind treatment, even though the apartments be bad, and the allowance scanty.

all open, they associate with one another as they please*. The allowance to each is six stivers a day paid by their creditors: on default of payment they are released.

This prison being in a close part of the city, is one of the most unhealthy. But I was informed, it is to be removed to a more airy situation in the southern suburbs.

[Spin-house.]
---
The Spin or Rasp-house has an inscription over the door, Stockholms Stad Spin oCh Rasp husj An. 1750. It Hands on a declivity, at the extremity of the suburbs, and near a lake. The number of prisoners was a hundred and eighty; twenty or twenty-five of whom I saw in a room, sorting, carding, or spinning wool: every prisoner is obliged to spin two pounds and a half (equal to about three thousand ells) of yarn in a day: all that is done by any prisoners more than this, they are paid for, at the rate of two stivers a pound; and, as a farther reward, they become entitled to an abridgment of their term of confinement, in proportion to their diligence.

The women's apartments were clean; but the countenances of the men and boys were sickly, and their rooms dirty and offensive. The men were not separated from the boys as they should have been, nor the women from the girls.

The rooms employed as an infirmary were clean, and strewed with the young flhoots of the spruce fir: it had in it five sick women, and five or six convalescents.

On inquiry, I found the scurvy was a prevailing disorder here, especially in August; which, I doubt not, is owing to close confinement, to the want of cleanliness, and to the use of salt-fish and other salt provisions. Some precautions are used against this disorder, for the prisoners at their admission are examined by the surgeons*, after which they are required to bathe themselves, and to continue this as a practice twice a month.

They attend prayers in the hall of the Spin-house every day; in summer, at six in the morning and seven in the evening; and in winter, at eight and four.

A person in the office of an inspector has a convenient house here, with a salary of .£50 per Annum, which is large for this country, and four times more than the salary of the keeper. I am persuaded of the impropriety of trusting such establishments to the care of interested men. Neither the condition of the wards, nor the appearance of the prisoners, did this inspector any credit -f\

[Hospital.]

I visited some charitable institutions in this city; I will just mention the Hospital for the sick. There were in it thirty-two patients. In the largest of the rooms there were only seven beds: a distinct bed was allotted to each patient, and all was clean and neat. Two of the rooms were appropriated to venereal patients.

One advantage which arises from the separation of prisoners is, that it prevents taking garnish: this,.though a constant practice here, is not common in foreign prisons.

RUSSIA. 85

The floors, as in the other hospitals and in most of the private houses, were strewed with the young shoots either of the spruce fir or juniper tree: having asked the reason, one of the surgeons told me, " it was done to prevent infection." I attended Mr. Akren, the principal surgeon, through the wards, and saw him dress the patients. Three or four pupils afiisted, and four other attendants; one of whom was a woman carrying a bason of water V

RUSSIA.

In Russia the peasants and servants are bondmen or slaves, and their lords (or matters) may inflict on them any corporal punishment, or banitti them to Siberia, on giving notice of their offence to the police. But they are not permitted to put them to death. Should they, however, die by the severity of their punishment, the penalty of the law is easily evaded. Instances, notwithstanding, of great attachment of peasants to their lords, in consequence of good treatment, are not uncommon. A gentleman was ttiewn me at Petersburg, whose peasants, hearing of his intention to sell his estate, brought him all the money they had saved, and gave it him, upon condition that he should keep his land, and ftilL continue to be their matter.

Debtors in this country are often employed as slaves by government, and allowed twelve roubles -j- yearly wages, which goes towards discharging the debt j. In some cases of private debts, if any person will give sufficient security to pay twelve-roubles'a year as long as the ttave lives, or till the debt is paid off-, as also to produce the ttave when he is demanded; such person may take him out of confinement: but if he foils to produce him when demanded, is liable to pay the whole debt immediately.

There are no regular gaolers appointed in Russia, but all the prisons are guarded by the military. Little or no attention is paid'to the reformation of prisoners.

[Russia.]

In the instructions for a new Code of laws by the present Empress, however, a very just and humane distinction is made between prisoners of different classes. "One ought not to confine in the same place, 1. an accused person, against whom there are only appearances, 2. a convict, 3. a criminal who is condemned to prison as a punishment. The accused person is only detained; the two others are imprisoned: but with respect to the former of them, the prison is only a part of punishment; with respect to the latter, it is the punishment itself*."

There is no capital punishment for any crime but treason: but the common punishment of the knoot is often dreaded more than death, and sometimes a criminal has endeavoured to bribe the executioner to kill him. This punishment seldom causes immediate death, but death is often the consequence of it.

[Petersburg.]

The governor of the police at Petersburg was so kind as to fix a time for shewing me all the instruments commonly used for punishment — the axe and block — the machine (now out of use) for breaking the arms and legs — the instrument for slitting or lacerating the nostrils — and that for marking criminals, (which is done by punctuation, and then rubbing a black powder on the wounds) — the knoot whip — and another called the cat, which consists of a number of thongs from two to ten.

[Knoot.]
---
The Knoot whip, is fixed to a wooden handle a foot long, and consists of several thongs about two feet in length twilled together, to the end of which is fastened a single tough thong of a foot and half, tapering towards a point, and capable of being changed by the executioner, when two much softened by the blood of the criminal.

August 10, 1781, I saw two criminals, a man and a woman, suffer the punishment of the knoot. They were conducted from prison by about fifteen hussars and ten soldiers. When they arrived at the place of punishment, the hussars formed themselves into a ring round the whipping-post, the drum beat a minute or two, and then some prayers were repeated, the populace taking off their hats. The woman was taken first; and after being roughly stript to the waist, her hands and feet were bound with cords to a post made for the purpose, a man Handing before the poll to keep the cords tight. A servant attended the executioner, and both were flout men. The servant first marked his ground, and struck the woman five times on the back. Every stroke seemed to penetrate deep into her flesh. But his master thinking him too gentle, pushed him aside, took his place, and gave all the remaining strokes himself, which were evidently more severe. The woman received twenty-five, and the man sixty:I pressed through the hussars, and counted the number as they were chalked on a board. Both seemed but just alive, especially the man, who yet had strength enough to receive a small donation with some signs of gratitude. They were conducted back to prison in a little waggon. I saw the woman in a very weak condition some days after, but could not find the man any more.

InfruSlion, Art. CLXXI.

Sect. IV. RUSSIA.

In the Fortress there are many vaulted rooms, Tome of which are now used for the confinement of deserters, and criminals of various forts, who work on the fortifications. Some were glad of the privilege of being employed in the governor's garden, for the fake of the flour which he gave them for their labour. Others, with logs to their legs, were drawing wood out of the Neva. Thirty-five were crowded into one of the rooms, which therefore was excessively hot, having only two small apertures (ten inches by nine) for the admission of air. In another part of this building, seventy-five slaves with logs fattened to both their legs, were lodged in four rooms, which were still more close and offensive. In a few rooms (used as barracks) some officers were confined. Every room was furnished with an oven or stove, and most of them with barrack-beds.

In the Police prison there were in one room nine women, and in two other rooms forty-four men. In two small and low arched cellars (very hot and offensive) I saw fifteen men, most of them in irons. In a room called the infirmary, detached from the rest of the prison, there were seven persons sick. All the prisoners subsist on voluntary contributions, collected in boxes before their grates, and at church. This is all the advantage they derive from the church near the prison, for they are never permitted to enter it, or to go out of their rooms-, except on particular occasions with guards of soldiers.

In the New government prison behind the courts of justice, there are barracks for the guard near the rooms of confinement. The number of prisoners was sixty-eight, including two confined for debt, and twenty-seven male and female vagrants and petty offenders, all crowded together into one room.

In the suburbs is a Prison, confiding of several timber houses, surrounded with high palisades. In one house I saw twenty-five prisoners, in another five or six, all with irons on both legs. Some were out at work, and the whole number was near eighty. Many were boys of twelve or fifteen years of age. In the middle there was a kitchen, in which was an oven and many loaves of bread for the prisoners, like that for the soldiers. They seemed under close confinement, though there is a large court in which they might be allowed to walk with safety.

The Prison for Debtors consists of four vaulted rooms communicating with one another, and furnished with stoves and barrack-beds. The prisoners are never permitted to go out of their rooms. They subsist by alms received from passengers in little boxes placed before the windows; but government supplies them with wood for fuel. One told me, he had been confined for five years, for a debt of fifteen roubles; and another, four years for twenty-five roubles.

A Spin-house (or house of correction) is building in this city, situated near the river. It is an elegant, though plain building, with fifty-seven windows in front, and two galleries at the back-front supported by pillars. There is an ascent of a few steps to the first: floor; all the staircases are stone (five feet wide); the rooms

are about thirty-three feet by twenty-three; the windows six feet from the floor; the ceilings are lofty, in the middle of which are apertures fourteen inches square; and the roof consists of thin iron plate.

I visited several hospitals in this city with pleasure, the rooms, even of the insane, being as clean as those in Holland: but I shall mention only two or three.

The hospital for soldiers, and the marine hospital, from a great quadrangle, built chiefly of brick, in a morass, near the Neva. The Military hospital consists of twenty-eight spacious rooms, besides two or three anatomical rooms in which lectures are read. There is a chapel in the centre, but it is in a ruinous state, having been left unfinished, because the builder had hanged himself in it. — At a little distance in a large area or field enclosed with wooden palisades, there are fourteen or fifteen houses constructed of wood, about eighty feet by twenty-one; in each of which there are forty or forty-five beds or cractes, admitting one patient only. The centre house has fourteen small rooms opening into a close passage, and very offensive.

The Admiralty or Marine Hospital has two floors. The rooms open into a gallery under arcades, and are clean and airy, having windows opposite to one another, and on one side looking towards the Neva. Four of these rooms were occupied, and in one of them there were forty beds, each admitting only one patient.

At the back of this hospital, in an area or garden enclosed by palisades, is a row of seven summer rooms for convalescents, each a separate building, seventy feet by twenty-six. They were clean and sweet, and strewed with the young shoots of the spruce fir. In the centre building the re are rooms for warming water for bathing; as there were also in the military hospital. Bathing is the constant practice of the Ruffians.

This provision of summer rooms is a wife expedient peculiar to Russia, and deserves the highest commendation. By the constant succession of patients, the walls of other hospitals are contaminated; but in Russia, by lodging patients in these summer rooms, the hospitals are left to be freshened and purified.

On a riling ground at a little distance from Petersburg, and on the south side of the river Neva, there is a stately pile of buildings, originally designed for a convent, but ever since 1764 converted by the Empress Catherine the Second, into a public establishment for educating the female nobility of Russia, and a limited number of the children of commoners. The Beeping rooms and dining-halls in these buildings are remarkably lofty and airy, having large galleries round them, and adjoining to the buildings there are spacious gardens and lawns, which extend to the banks of the river. — The number of the children of nobility on this establishment is two hundred; and the number of the children of commoners, or peasants was, till 1770,} limited to two hundred and forty: but since this year it has been increased to two htmdred and eighty, \>y a fund provided by the munificence of general De Betjkoi, the enlightened and liberal head and director-general of this, and all the other institutions of the same kind established by her imperial majesty.

The principal regulations for conducting this institution are the following. Petersburg.

The children are admitted between five and six years of age, and continued on the house

establishment twelve years. They are divided into classes according to their ages, four of

of nobles with fifty in each class, and four of commoners with seventy in each class. — In every third year on the 21st of April, (the birth-day of the Empress) fifty children of the nobility, and seventy of commoners are taken in, to replace the same numbers discharged.

Before they rife every morning, the windows of the rooms are thrown open to purify them with fresh air.

The first class (dressed in brown, and consisting of children of the youngest ages,) rife at seven in winter, and at six in summer. — After being washed and attending prayers, they are taken into the garden where they breakfast, and play about in the coldest weather till nine. During their first year, each of them is allowed for breakfast, a small loaf of white bread, and a glass of milk and water; but after their first year, they are allowed no other drink than water. — At nine they are called back to the house, and from' this hour to eleven are employed in learning the French and Ruffian languages, and in knitting, sewing, &c. but care is taken to render all the instruction they receive agreeable, nothing being taught in this establishment by compulsion. — Twice in the week they receive lessons in dancing; and this is a part of education common to all the classes, and never discontinued, because reckoned conducive to health. — After eleven they return to their play in the garden, where they continue till noon, at which time they are called to dinner, which consists of soup, vegetables, &c. For some months at first they are allowed meat; but they are gradually weaned from it, till at last, while in this and the next class, it comes to be entirely withheld from them except in soups, in order to cure them of some cutaneous distempers to which at this age they are subject, and also to prepare them for passing with less danger through the hooping-cough, measles and small-pox. — After dinner they return to the garden, and at four, have a repast similar to that in the morning, viz. a loaf of bread and a glass of water. Here they continue to divert themselves till at seven they are called to supper, which consists in winter of dried fruit, milk and grain; and in summer of preparations of milk, and some provisions from the garden. — It may be proper to add, that they read and write standing, and are not allowed to fit down, except to needle-work. — In consequence of this management, and of living so much in the air, and being used to exercise, and cleanliness and a Ample diet, they are seldom known to take cold; and become capable of bearing the severest weather of the climate without receiving any harm, their clothing being only a short wadded cloak, whilst others are loaded with furs.

The second class (dressed in blue) enter it about eight years of age, and are obliged to apply more closely to writing, drawing, dancing, &c.

The third dafs (dressed in grey) enter it at eleven or twelve years of age. They rife at five, in the summer, and six in winter; but are called to the house (after break-fasting in the garden,) an hour sooner than the children in the first and second classes; because more time is wanted for instructing and improving them. They are now taught (besides drawing, dancing, turning needle-work, tic.) vocal and instrumental music. They are allowed a ball and concert every week; and a taste for books is inspired, by putting them upon copying and reciting felett passages from the best authors.

The fourth class (dressed in white) enter it at fourteen or fifteen years of age. They are taught tambour-work, house-keeping, the management of a family, &c. and initiated into history, geography and natural philosophy. In order to acquire a just elocution, and to exercise themselves in politeness, and vocal and instrumental music, they occasionally give balls and little operas to company from Petersburg.

The children of the nobility are distinguished from the children of commoners, only by wearing a finer camlet of the colours appropriated to the different classes; and as far as diet, exercise, regimen, &c. are concerned, the method of managing them is the same; but the instruction given the latter, is confined to needle-work, reacting, house-keeping and such other occupations and improvements as are suitable to the humbler walks of life, for which they are intended.

The children on this foundation enjoy, as might be expected, an uncommon degree of health. — Of fifty-one children of nobility admitted in 1764, and fifty admitted in 1767, and fifty-two in 1770, none had died in 1781; and of fifty admitted at different times, by the particular order of the Empress, between 1764 and 1780, only two had died in 1781. — Of sixty children also of commoners admitted in 1767, and seventy in 1770, only seven had. died in 1781. But of sixty admitted in 1764, thirteen had died; in consequence, it is supposed, of having been lodged in a part of the buildings which had been just erected, and therefore was not sufficiently dry.

This account I awe to the obliging information of Dr. Guthrie, physician to a military cadet corps of nobles, established at Petersburg by the Empress, and supposed the grandest institution of the kind in the world.

At Cronstadt (or Crownstade) the principal station for shipping, the staves were lodged in several rooms enclosed by palisades, and guarded by an officer with a hundred soldiers, who attend them while at work. In the rooms, there were only two, who were sick: the rest were removing the ballast flung out of the ships. They had healthy countenances, and were robust and strong, though their diet seemed scanty. — The following is their allowance from government. To each for diet, seventy-

two pounds and a half (about 65 English pounds) of rye flour*, seven pounds and a half of barley or buck-wheat, and two pounds of salt, every month. — For clothing, a sheep-lk:n pelijje-, coarse cloth coat, waistcoat and breeches; woollen hat and fur cap. and a pair of drawers every two years; and every year, sixteen arjhins (about 12-| yards) of coarse linen for shirts and thin drawers; three pair of stockings, three pair of shoes, rwo pair of fur gloves, and a pair of ftieep-skin cangees. Fuel also is allowed by government f.

The number of Haves, malefactors and debtors is in general about two hundred, but in November 1781, their number was only one hundred and fifty-one, viz. Haves indebted to government and malefactors, thirty-four; debtors, and peasants sent by their lords for crimes and misdemeanors on their estates, one hundred and seventeen. — I will say nothing of the prison, because I saw the ground marked out for a new one, which is to be erected under the superintendence of our attentive and judicious countryman Admiral Greig.

In the Hospital at Cronftact, built by Peter the Great, and intended by him for a palace, there were many spacious rooms, all perfectly clean, with eight or ten beds in every room, each bed admitting one patient only. Two hundred and seventeen of the patients were sailors; and on their beds were marked the names of the ships to which they belonged. Books were hung up at the doors of the rooms, containing an account of the numbers of the beds, the prescriptions, diet, &c.

At a little distance from this building, there are seven rooms for convalescents and scorbutic patients, seventy-two feet in length and twenty-three in breadth. Four of them were occupied, one of which had in it fifty-five beds, and the rest almost as many. The kitchen and bake-house were separate buildings; and the bread appeared to be wholesome and good. There was here also a room for the hot, or vapour baths, which are common in Russia, and which undoubtedly conduce greatly to the health, as well as the cleanliness of the inhabitants J.

August 22, 1781, the number of patients in this hospital was five hundred and fifteen. Those attended by surgeons were separated from the rest, and the appearance of all of them shewed plain proofs of the care and attention paid them. An officer visits the hospital every day, and makes a report to the admiral.

The French prisoners in England have been desirous of having their allowance in flour, that they might make their own bread, as the Russian slaves do, who also, both here and at the fortress, make for themselves a fermented liquor called quat, two barrels of which I saw in the rooms.

f The expence for every Have is twelve roubles a year; namely, for diet, eight roubles and fifty-two copecks; for clothes, three roubles and forty-eight copecks. I owe this account to the kindness of Admiral Grets.

AtWvscHNEi Wolotschok. the prison is in the suburbs, conftnnfted of wood, and enclosed with palisades of thick planks. Here were sixteen prisoners employed on the public works, all but one, in irons; two were loaded with irons on their legs, and chained together by the neck.

In the prison at Tver there were twenty-six prisoners. The rooms were so offensive, that a medical gentleman did not choose to look into more than one of them. It is a new prison, but I hope not a model for others, as has been reported. The prisoners in it, and likewise in the prison last mentioned, subsist on charitable contributions.

The great Prison at Moscow, Kalufka OJlrog is in the suburbs In the first room of a brick building the re are four wooden cages, in which were two men chained by the neck to the wall, with irons on their legs. Near this room there were several rooms for the examination and punishment of criminals.

At the back of this building is a court sixty feet wide, with a guard-house in it and six rooms for confinement.

The main prison, on the outside is two hundred and eighty feet by two hundred and forty-four. It is enclosed with strong pieces of timber sixteen or eighteen feet high. The entrance from the court just mentioned leads into a walk (twenty-four feet wide), on one side of which there are three other courts, and four on the opposite side of different dimensions. In these courts there are a number of wooden houses confiding of one, two or three rooms; every room having barrack-bedsteads or Jhelves in it, and an iron-lattice door, with another of wood. In two of the courts there are small rooms or chapels, where divine service is read. The whole number of prisoners in September 1781 was seventy-four. There is a distinct court and two rooms appropriated to women, in which were ten, but none in irons. The doors of the houses were open to allow the prisoners to walk in the courts; except the houses in the two upper courts, where, in a building occupied only by himself, I saw a Ruffian gentleman, who was, always locked up; and whose crime, I was informed, had been cruelly whipping his slaves.

One centinel flood at each corner of this prison, one at the centre of the front, three in the middle walk, and two at the entrance. In the walk there is the well, and a filed, or hut for the sale of quas f, apples and bread; and on the outside of the door many boxes to receive the alms of passengers; the prisoners subsisting chiefly by charitable contributions J.

At the New government in a large room on the ground-floor, there were sixty-nine prisoners, of whom fourteen were women. They were petty offenders, subsisted on charitable donations, and looked dirty and sickly. In a room up stairs I saw eight criminals with irons round their necks, chained with a heavy chain to a log. In each-of the rooms a soldier flood with a drawn sword in his hand.

The Prison for debtors in this city was very dirty. In five rooms I saw above a hundred miserable wretches lying on the floors, most of them half naked. — At a little distance from these rooms there were six criminals in one of the most offensive rooms I ever entered.

The Military prison is fitiaated in the middle of a plain at Butirki, about a mile from this city. It is a single room, into which were crowded one hundred and thirty prisoners, though only twenty-nine feet by twenty-six, and not nine feet high. It is constructed of wood, furrouided with wooden palisades, and furnished with two tier of barrack-bedsteads withou. beds. The pale sickly countenances of the prisoners bespoke oppression and misc-y, and prevented the wonder I should have otherwise felt at finding so large a nunber as fifty-five in the ward appropriated to the sick, in the military hospital. \ centinel was planted at each corner, and two at the door. On the outside of the palirades there was a well, and two or three buildings or barracks, in one of whii* were confined nine officers, but they had beds.

At the back of Catherine hospital in th invalids court, in a prison consisting only of one room, there were fifty-two men and fev^teen women. The women were employed in weeding in the garden, and the men in mptying a moat at a palace about half a mile from the prison. They had no irons, t> Were distinguished by a black cross on the back of their clothes. They work from 'orning till night, except for two hours about noon, and are allowed three copecks woi^ of bread in a day; but salt is withheld from them by way of punishment.

One of my vifirs happening to be on a Sundayj was ffirprised to find the prisoners all at work; some piling and planking the canal, cers cutting the barberry hedges in the palace garden, and the women weeding.

At a Convent about a mile out of the city, there is *room which is used as a prison for petty offenders, in which there were two men i-j five women. The former were -employed in sawing wood, and the latter were.Work in the palace garden. Their drink was water, and their allowance of bread so Rufljan pounds each every day.

Here is a palace unoccupied, which was used as a Lazaret in the time of the plague in 1772, consisting of near a hundred rooms round a courts corridors or passages are about nine feet wide. On going over it, I could not but^ jt was well adapted for a healthy prison, the court being spacious, the situationear tjiei river, and the rooms, of a proper size.

The Military hospital, founded by Peter the Great, is finely situated on a rising ground near a river. On the ground-floor there are four lofty and spacious rooms; in two of which there were eighty-eight patients, the other two were repairing. Over thele rooms there are two anatomical rooms, and a third room in which lectures are read four times in a week. — Adjoining is a wooden building for lunatics, confiding of twelve rooms (fifteen feet by twelve and a half) and a back room to each for a keeper. There are also several houses for the director, physician, surgeons, apothecary, &c. At a little greater distance, but on a more elevated spot, there is a large quadrangular building, in which were upwards of four hundred patients, each room containing about thirty beds. In one part of this building the re were fifty-five patients from the military prison. — At my first: visit the w^ds were dirty and offensive; but at a subsequent visit the physician favoured me wi,n his company, and I found them much cleaner. I flung open some of the windows in one large ward, and this purified it more than all the shoots of the sprucefir with which the rooms were itrewed *. i

In the garden is a building construsted of wod, for drying herbs, plants, &c. many of which grow there. It is the complete house for the purpose I ever saw (eighty-one feet by twenty-eight). A variety / plants were drying on the ground-floor, and six or seven men were employed in cl^hing them, and in cutting roots. The first: floor was divided into two rooms, in which were many double cases, or drawers, (the upper, half as large as the under Ones painted green, with the names of the roots and herbs they contained. The root over these, was full of herbs drying on poles; and in a balcony over the portic'(^x f*eet and a half wide) herbs, roots, and feeds are dried. All the windows f flutters in the house, and the lids of the cases, were open. Those herbs which /e dl7> wefe as green as when they were first gathered.

On conrerfing with the physician, concef'S the treatment of the sick when the plague was at Moscow in 1772, he said, " it was nearly the same vJours in the gaol-fever, viz. bark and good broths, with as much air as possible." The late Sir John PS1*' President of the Royal Society, in his discourse at the Anni-verfary meeting, 30th November 1776, ir/ms us a* PaSe that " the ^ate Dr. Mounsey, F.K. S. who had«lived long in Russia, and had been Ar}ter under two successive sovereigns — happening to be at Moscow < when he perused the Olfervations onf Jail-fever — was induced to compare what he read in that treatise with what he should see in the fevc Prisons of that large city: but to his surprize, after visiting them " all, and finding them full of male/ors (for the late empress then suffered none — to be put to death) " he could discover no fever among*"1' nor learn that anyacute distemper peculiar to jails had ever been " known there. — Upon his return' St- Petersburg, he made the same inquiry there, and with the same result." /

Paulowski hospital is situated on an airy spot about a mile from the city. The entrance is by a flight of seven steps. It is built of wood, and only one (lory high, con-sifting of seven rooms: the beds were linen, and not crowded, and all clean and near. — Here is a chapel; and very near, flood a building for venereal patients; but a more convenient building for such patients is just finished, containing six airy and spacious rooms hung with white painted linen. The apothecary lives in this hospital; and the director and two surgeons in neat houses in the spacious court belonging to it, adjoining to which there is a large garden.

Catherine hospital consists of several houses of one story; which being built round an elegant court, and' painted white, have a pleasing effect. The ascent is three feet and a half *. There are in these buildings twelve rooms hung with paper and clean, with a number of beds not exceeding seven or eight in each room. A separate bed is allotted to every patient. — Thermometers are kept in the rooms of this and other hospitals, but the heat of the air was many degrees above that which the surgeon. said was the proper temperature (io degrees of Reaumur's scale), all the windows being shut. There are small ventilators in the windows; but they can be of little use unless the windows are daily opened. — I was pleased to see in every room of these hospitals a tin or pewter cistern, over a copper bason, with towelsand wished there were the same attention to cleanliness in all our hospitals. — At the front of this hospital are two pumps, by which, in case of fire, water may be easily raised to the top of th‘e buildings.

Here were several rooms with beds for inoculated patients; but none of them had been occupied for same time. Here were also separate buildings for venereal patients. Adjoining, is another court in which there are several rooms, tolerably clean, for old military invalids. Their number was about eighty, and fbme of them had served as soldiers under Peter the Great.

I repeatedly visited the great Foundling hospital in this city at the particular desire of the good general De Betjhoi; but having given a description of the convent at St. Petersburg, which may be thought somewhat of a digression from my subject, I refer my readers to Mr. Coxe's pamphlet for an-account of this hospital f;

The foundation of this and PaultnvJH hospital being stone, and elevated considerably above the level of the ground, I observed several apertures (twelve inches by seven) in the stone work, for eaufing a circulation of air under the floors. If apertures were also made in the floors, they would be conducive to the health of the patients by freshening and airing the rooms.

f Tire public is much obliged to Mr. Coxe, for the account he has given of his examination of the prisons and hospitals in his tour through the northern parts of Europe, and for the many valuable remarks which he has made, in a pamphlet entitled, Account of the Prisons and Hospitals in Russia, Sweden, and Denmark.

POLAND.

In Warsaw, at the Town-house, in September 1781, there were twenty-six men and eight women, crowded into three rooms on the ground-floor for confining debtors; the reason of which was, that the prison was repairing. Down several steps were eight new dungeons for criminals, four on each side a passage only six feet wide. There was no gaoler, the prison being guarded by soldiers.

At the prison near the palace, in two rooms there were seven prisoners, five of them in irons. Allowance a good grosche a day, which is a little more than three halfpence.

The entrance to another prison was through a guard-room full of soldiers. In one room (twenty feet by ten) were twenty-six miserable objects, some sick on the.dirt floor. In another room, not so bad, there were four.

In the prison in the new city there were a few women confined for debt, and a man and woman for theft: their allowance one good grosche a day.

A date on the front of a prison near the Vistula informed me it was rebuilt in 1769. There were eighty-one prisoners in it, whose beds were mattresses fluffed with straw. Mofl of them were employed in sawing wood and other occupations in the streets of the city for the inhabitants, who get their labour at one third less than the expence of other labourers 5 the public being at the same time eased of part of the expence of supporting them.

In the suburbs is the Zugth-hus, or spin-house, improperly so calied, many of the miserable wretches seeming to have nothing to do. Some, however, were employed; and their allowance for working from six in the morning to seven at night, with two hours rest at noon, was two grosche (3?d.) each per day, which went to the keeper for feeding, or rather (as appeared by their looks) for Jlarving them. The sick were lying on floors of dirt, without medical or any other assistance. This gave me so unfavourable an opinion of the police of this country, that I could feel no inclination to visit the prisons in the provinces, or, (according to my confiant practice in other places) to revisit those in the capital.

The Great Hospital (or Enfant Jefui) has this inscription over the gate, Regi facu~ lorura immortali et invisibili soli Deo, Honor et Gloria. There were in this hospital near eight hundred grown persons and children of different ages. The rooms were all clean, and great attention seemed to be paid to the sick by the good sisters, according to their usual practice. Most of the children were foundlings. Those who bring the m

put them into a cradle hung at the outside of one of the rooms, ringing at the same time a bell, in consequence of which notice, persons attending within, turn the cradle on an axis into the house, where the children are immediately taken care of As they grow up they are made to work in different ways suitable to their ages and sexes. I saw a hundred and thirty girls, all neat, working at their needles, and singing at the same time a hymn. At both my visits I found an attentive and affectionate superior in the wards: the countenances of the numerous inhabitants shewed their love and respect to him.

The convent in this city belonging to the Fratres misericordia I found uncleanly; and it is the only instance of the kind to which I have been witness in this fraternity. In the second visit, the wards were fumigated with juniper berries on burning coals.

The Convent of St. Roque also I found'close, crowded and offensive, the windows being kept {hut.

In the Hospital of St. Martin there were many sick, of both sexes.

In the Hospital of St. Lazarus appropriated to venereal patients, there were sixty-one miserable objects, in close offensive rooms. It is badly situated, and in all respects one of the word: hospitals I ever saw*.

SILESIA.

In October 1781 I visited the City-prison at Breslau, built, as the date on the front informed me, in 1689. It consists of twenty-three arched rooms on different stories; in most of which thdre is a piece of timber on the floor with a staple in it, to which criminals may be chained. I found a prisoner or two in some of the rooms, but none in irons. — Their allowance is two pounds of bread each, a day:(one hundred and twelve of their pounds are equal to one hundred English). To most of the rooms there are double doors, one iron-latticed within another of wood; this is a very proper contrivance where prisoners are always confined. — At the top of the staircases trap doors are placed for preventing escapes in the night. This prison has also two dungeons down ten steps.

Near one of the city gates and opposite to the guard-room, there is a Frifon which consists of two circular rooms, each of them nineteen feet and a half in diameter.

At "Warsaw there was no regular assixe of bread', yet 0x1 weighing the various forts which I purchased of several bakers, I found bread cheaper here than in any other part of Europe which I had then visited.

One is appropriated to men and the other to women; in each there were eleven prisoners, who, by the Governor's order, are employed out of doors for seven or eight hours every day. Their allowance is, two pounds of bread a day, besides fire and candle.

In the Spin-house, situated near the river which runs through the town, there were thirty-six poor people, besides eighteen prisoners committed for offences. The former are allowed meat three days in the week; and their rooms and beds appeared clean — the latter are allowed meat only on the great holy-days; that is, four times in the year. During the rest of the year they subsist on soup, and an allowance of two pounds/w day of tolerably good bread. They are employed in spinning from six to eleven every morning, and from twelve to six in the afternoon. — In the chapel belonging to this work-house, divine service is performed every Sunday and Thursday, the poor fitting on benches in the lower part of the chapel, and the prisoners in the galleries.

In the Convent of the Fratres misericordia, there is a ward with forty-three beds for the sick; it is twenty-five feet and a half wide, and the beds about three feet asunder. I saw eight or ten friars serving the sick with their dinners between ten and eleven. The friars themselves dine at eleven. I went again at four, and they were going to supper. All was clean and neat.

Patients from any country are admitted into this convent; and the friars publish every year a list of the admissions and deaths. In 1776, the number admitted was seven hundred and forty-eight, and the number that died was sixty four. In 1780, these numbers were six hundred and fifty-nine, and sixty-one.

I visited two or three other hospitals in this city, but saw nothing remarkable.

GERMANY.

AT Berlin, in the City Prison called Calands Hof, there are eight rooms on the ground-floor, and down ten steps eight dungeons: these rooms (thirteen feet by nine feet four inches) were numbered, and had barracks and stoves, one stove for two rooms. The dungeons are for the more atrocious criminals, of whom I saw several in irons, who were chained to staples in the wall. In 1778 the number of prisoners was eighteen men and thirteen women; and in 1781 it was fifty-eight of both sexes. Two of these were debtors; whose allowance is two grosche (3-d.) a day-'each. This allowance is paid by the creditors, and if omitted one week, the debtor is set at liberty. — The allowance to criminals is one grosche and a half. The prisoners, when their process is finished, are permitted to go into the court; the men for an hour each time, at eight, one, and four in summer, and three in winter; the women for one hour only in the day, from two to three. — The prisoner, at

his discharge, pays the gaoler a grosche a day, for the time he was confined before his process was finished, unless the judge orders otherwise. — The process ought to be finished in three months; and if it is not, the secretary is required to give account of the cause of the delay. After three months imprisonment, the fee to the gaoler is only half a grosche a day. — Here is a head-keeper, who has apartments in the prison; an under-gaoler whose rooms look towards the prison windows; a surgeon whose salary is fifty crowns (ecus) a year, besides the pay for his medicines; a chaplain; and a secretary (greffier) who keeps the books, papers, &c. — The head keeper's salary is fifteen crowns and twelve grosche a quarter. In a book which he keeps the following particulars are entered in ten columns. — The time when the prisoner was committed — the magistrate by whom he was committed — his name — age — religion — place of nativity — condition — cause of confinement — time of discharge — and the number of prisoners. One of the judges is obliged to visit the prison once a week.

There were only three or four prisoners in a room, none of whom are permitted to go into the court till their process is finished (as my conductor informed me), that confederates may not be together. — One soldier at the gate, guards the prison in the day-time; but at night it is guarded by one within, and another at the back of the prison. These soldiers are relieved every two hours.

There is no torture-room in any of the prisons in the Prussian dominions, for the present king has set the example in Germany of abolishing the cruel practice. — In one of the rooms of this prison are alphabetically digested, the names and descriptions, with the sentences, of all who have been confined in this prison, in order that should they be found here a second time, they may suffer a much severer punishment.

[Court Prison.]

In the Court-prison (Haus-Voightey), there are seven cells for criminals, and over them eight rooms for debtors and smugglers. These rooms look into a court, to which prisoners have access two hours in a day. All the rooms have barracks and stoves as in the other prison*. Here are two or three good rooms for debtors adjoining to the keeper's apartments, and several rooms in a back court. Creditors allow each debtor two grosche a day, and one for firing, besides paying one to the gaoler. Here were thirty-six prisoners in 1781; nine of them criminals in the cells. — Allowance to criminals is one grosche a day. — I here saw two of that sort of vests foi punishment, called Spanish mantles (similar to those mentioned at Copenhagen p. 76.). one weighed fifty, the other seventy-five pounds; they are sometimes worn at the gate of this prison, and by smugglers at the custom-house, one, two, or three hours.

* Here the criminals had fire in all the stoves, though early in October. On my observing the propriety of this, the gaoler asked me, whether criminals had not fire allowed them in my country? On my saying that in some prisons they had not; he replied, "How then do they exist in winter?"

[Berlin Maison de Travail.]

---

The Maison de Travail, is a spacious building in the suburbs: it was erected in 1758: the front is two hundred and twenty feet, the sides a hundred and sixty. It has a court in the centre. The number of inhabitants in 1778, were about four hundred and fifty, including fourteen children, and in 1781 five hundred and forty-six. Beggars, idle persons, and petty offenders of both sexes are sent to this house. Those who can work are employed, fed, and clothed; and proper care and attention paid to the aged and infirm. Every time I was there, I was pleasingly struck with the cleanly appearance of all the inhabitants. Old and young, men and women, were spinning and carding wool, in rooms about seventy-five feet by twenty-four. All have clean linen once a week; and I observed a towel hanging up in each room. The apartments are white-washed once a year: this gives freshness and neatness, and also light to the work-rooms. Here is a chapel with two galleries, one for each sex , and an apartment for the chaplain. The hall for meals is spacious: the hours, seven, twelve, and seven. I was present at dinner-time , after ringing a bell, in ten minutes all were seated at about twenty tables, eighteen to each table. Four separate tables were at a little distance for criminals. A servant having called out, silence, the school-master prayed at the desk in the middle of the room. And after all had helped themselves with barley-soup *, while they were eating, he read part of a chapter in the Bible; then sung an hymn, in which the children, who were all at one table, joined; after which, all went out and fetched their cans, each containing about a quart, and they were filled with small beer. After spending about half an hour at dinner, they had half an hour for recreation. The whole was conducted with the greatest regularity.

In the hall are morning prayers, at which all must attend clean, and then they take their bread for breakfast. — The inhabitants are divided into two classes, the poor and criminals. In 1781 there were eighty-six of the latter class, who are more confined than the poor. Both classes have the same nourishment, except that the first have meat twice a week, and the second only on Sunday. Their weekly talk is twelve pieces (or knots), each weighing five ounces: if they do more, they are paid for it. When they are sick, they are sent to the great hospital; where the room allotted to them, and all the other rooms, are two much crowded. — Dinner for the second class is, Sunday, pease and half a pound of meat; Monday and Friday, beans or lentils; Tuesday and Saturday, flour; Wednesday, barley; Thursday, pease.

This house resembles the old rasp or work-house at Amsterdam. It is exceedingly neat, and such great attention is paid to all confined in it, as prevents every ground!

I tailed the barley-soup, the bread and die beer, which were wholesome and good, and they had! enough. — They have butter or cheese, with their bread for supper*

of complaint. The ftrict and good police preserves the city of Berlin entirely free from beggars*.

In the Orphan-house there were forty-six boys and forty-one girls, all healthy and cheerful, employed in spinning wool in two spacious rooms. I looked into their bed-rooms and observed them to be clean and airy, having opposite windows which were thrown open. — From seven to nine o'clock, and from one to three, they are at school; and from nine to eleven, and three to fix, they work.

There are two infirmaries in which there was only one Jick child. — This house exhibits a contrail to that at Copenhagen; though the employments of the children, which my conductor there pretended to be the cause of their cutaneous disorders, are the same.

At Spandau, about ten miles from Berlin, are two prisons. The Fortress or castle, is surrounded with water. Thirty-six Bate prisoners were confined in it in 1778, and a hundred and five criminals. Some few of the latter were rasping logwood; the talk for each, thirty-six pounds a day: but most of them were spinning. The criminals were badly lodged, and there seems to be little attention paid to them. They had a light chain to each foot, and such as were taken after an escape had a collar of iron. In 1781 there were a hundred and fourteen prisoners. Here are none but men, for no women are ever permitted to continue a night in the castle.

In the House of correction, in 1778, there were about a hundred and fifty persons, spinning, knitting, and carding wool for a manufactory in Berlin. Forty-seven of these were men, committed for small offences. They have meat (4 lb.) only on Sundays, in this and some other houses of correction. Here were some rooms with silk-worms, on which the female prisoners attended. Neither this, nor any foreign houses of correction which I have seen, are without a chapel.

In 1781, there were seventy men and one hundred and ten women. The apartments of the latter were neat and clean. Their dinner was good soup made of barley: but the bread was not so good as at the work-house at Berlin; the daily allowance was twenty-two ounces, together with two quarts of beer. — A few sometimes work more than their talk, and are paid for it. A distinction is made between the prisoners; and such as are reckoned infamous, are confined in a room by themselves. — I made the same inquiry of the keeper here that I had made in similar houses, whether the work of the prisoners maintained them?. The same general, answer was given, no, no.

That the police is indeed strict and extensive I had some evidence by weighing the bread from various parts of the city; all which exactly agreed with the affixe or standard. In June 1778, the fine white bread was something above three halfpence a pound; and there was just double the weight of rye bread for the same money. In October 1781, three pennyworth of the finest was ilb. 140Z; of the second sort, 31b. 7 oz; and of the third, 51b. 40Z. The bakers here and in Silesia, gain more by the fine bread, than by the coarse, which last fort, however, they are obliged to make; this is designed for the advantage of the poor. — Here also the price of the {Several forts of butchers meat is fixed and published,

At Magdeburg the Prussian slaves were at work on the fortifications, serving the masons, digging land, &c. Their daily allowance is two pounds of bread, and on the days they work, they have also in money, half a grosche, about three farthings. The number was only fifty-one, for many had been taken to recruit the army.

In the other prisons, nothing seemed worthy of observation: but in the house of correction (which was formerly a convent) was a mill to grind or beat the logwood that the men respect; and two or three large chambers of silk-worms, on which the women attended.

If I may judge, by what I saw of the state prisons here, and at Spandau, and by the few prisoners in the spacious areas, all their apartments are not so dreadful as some imagine; nor are all the persons confined in them unhealthy and miserable objects*.

The house of correction for Lusatia, at Lukau, is a spacious prison.' The men were treading in a large wheel to grind corn, five and five by turns. Some of them had iron coliars, as at Bern, but no irons on their feet. The prison for the women was a distinct building; their employment was spinning.

At Dresden, the apartments of the slaves being under the fortifications, must be unhealthy. I saw four sick, and yet they had their irons on. Among those that were at work, one had an iron coliar, by way of punishment for making an escape, besides the broad iron about his leg. Another was fitting, and endeavouring somewhat to alter the place of his iron. He told me that the weight was marked on it twenty-one pounds, and that he could not have it changed to the other leg without paying a smith.

Here are two other prisons. The house of correction has ten or twelve rooms, each about ten feet square, with one window, and an aperture over the door, and barrack-bedsteads. There were ten prisoners, five of each sex. Three of the men were rasping logwood in a room down twenty steps; and the other two were employed as labourers in building a chapel. This prison and the orphan-house, is, very improperly, one building.

The other prison for the bailliage, contains nineteen chambers, in which were twenty-six prisoners; most of whom had a chain (some on one foot, some on both) fattened to a staple in the wall. The prison was dirty; and the gaoler's pan of charcoal and frankincense (which his negligence rendered necessary) could not prevent its being very offensive. Here was one debtor, who had from his creditor six grosche (ten pence halfpenny) a day. The criminals allowance is one grosche (about seven farthings) each f.

They are not all confined to a small quantity of bread and water, in cells of four feet square and six feet high, and loaded with seventy-eight pounds of iron, as the ingenious and intrepid Trend, who was six years in this fortress.

women.

Sect. IV. GERMANY.

There was nothing very remarkable in the two prisons at Prague. The men at the Maison de Force, work out, with a guard. Tawing wood, &c. for twelve creutzers a day *, which is less than the common wages of labourers. The prisoners themselves receive only four for a day's work, the rest is paid to the house. Many were thus employed, with chains to one or both legs, according to the different terms of their confinement.

At Vienna, in 1778,1 visited all the prisons, and most of the hospitals. The prisons are old buildings, and afford no instruction.

The front of the great prison, La Maison de Bourreau, is remarkable for a very striking representation of the crucifixion of our Saviour, and the two thieves on mount Calvary. In this prison are many horrid dungeons.

Here, as usual, I inquired whether they had any putrid fever, and was answered in the negative. But in one of the dark dungeons down twenty-four steps, I thought I had found a person with the gaol-fever. He was loaded with heavy irons, and chained to the wall: anguish and misery appeared with clotted tears on his face. He was not capable of speaking to me; but on examining his breast and feet for petechia or spots, and finding he had a strong intermitting pulse, I was convinced that he was* not ill of that disorder. A prisoner in an opposite cell told me, that the poor creature had desired him to call out for assistance, and he had done it^ but was not heard. This is one of the bad effects of dungeons.

In the House of correction, were a hundred and sixty-nine meny. and a hundred and forty women. The women were employed in carding, spinning, and knitting. I was present on a Monday morning, when they brought their week's work, for which, after it had been weighed, they received their pay. They have all that they earn for themselves. A few received twenty-six creutzers each, others less. The keeper was employed in putting the name on the work of each prisoner, and setting down the money that was paid, and the cotton delivered. The prisoners fazv the cotton weighed, and took as much as they could spin in that week-f. At dinner-time, several large pans of soup and beer were brought in, and the prisoners bought what they thought proper.

The prison was too much crowded, the house not being built for the purpose to > which it is applied In several rooms the men were carding and spinning. In one

In return, I gave my opinion that the attention to a prison ought to be the whole employment of a gaoler, without which, little regard will be paid to cleanliness or humanity.

A creutzer is near a halfpenny, t the holydays, when the prisoners are not permitted to work, each has an allowance of four,) or five creutzers.

room, some of them, who were tailors, were making clothes for the soldiers: in another, some were weaving coarse linen at eight looms: and in another room, they were making thick blankets for the convents. Two more rooms were warehouses for cloth, stockings, coverlets, &c. manufactured in the house for sale. They were then white-washing the house*. In the chapel is a proper reparation of men and women. Here, and at Prague, and in some other parts of Germany, they have iron-grate doors, which do not prevent the circulation of air, so salutary and necessary in houses of confinement. Too little attention was paid to the lodgings of the prisoners, for they had no coverlets.

Though I could not mention with commendation the prisons of this city, yet I must acknowledge, I was greatly pleased with the public buildings for the indigent, the aged, and infirm; which do honour to the citizens in general, and especially to the late Empress Queen,

The great Alms-house in the suburbs consists of three courts. The front of this spacious building is six hundred and thirty-seven feet; the sides eleven hundred and fifty-three. The inhabitants are near three thousand, including the military invalids. It was agreeable to observe their order, neatness, and cleanliness. Here poverty and old age appeared with a smiling aspect. Many of them were seventy or eighty years of age. They were cheerfully spinning, because wharever they could gain was to be their own.

Les Freres de Charite have not only wards for the sick in their convent, but these friars have also another airy and commodious house with gardens, to which they remove their patients when they begin to recover. In this house were two wards up stairs, and each ward had fourteen beds.

The noble Hospital for bringing up children, was the plan of one person, whom I left engaged in the improvement of his liberal design. In sixteen rooms for boys, were five hundred and thirty-nine beds, and two hundred and forty-one in eight rooms for girls. The extent of the front is six hundred and sixty-two feet.

In the great alms-house, and in several prisons and other public buildings, the rooms are all arched with stone or brick, to prevent danger and confusion in case of fire. — In several prisons and hospitals, where I have found the staircases and floors wood, my mind has reverted to the wife precautions used.in this city.

Before I leave this city, I would just mention, that every month, an account of the price, weight and measure of bread and jlour, is put up on the gates f.

It is the general rule m Dutch and German houses of correction, to white-wash them once or twice a year. I seldom neglected to inquire about this practice, as we have a clause relative to this beneficial -mode, in a late act for preferring the health of prisoners in gaol.

At Gratz (the capital of Sana") I observed in the house of correction, that the prisoners had an appearance far more healthy than those I had seen in a similar house at Vienna. They have beds and coverlets, and the guards see that the men take off their clothes at night.

I omit particulars concerning the prison at Laubach in Carniola, as I cannot say a word in favour of it.

At Trieste, the prison consists of eight or ten very close offensive rooms, each having only one small window. The pale countenances of the (nineteen) prisoners bespoke their own misery, and the negligence of the magistrates and keepers.

But in the Castle were eighty-five slaves (condannati) who seemed healthy and well. They were confined for three, five, seven, or fourteen years and upwards; and were employed on the roads, in the harbour. See. Some of them were at work in a large lighter, clearing the harbour, just under my chamber window *. They were guarded by six soldiers. They did not work harder, than other labourers would in the same employment. Their hours for work were from five in the morning till between five and six in the afternoon; but they had two (from eleven to one) allowed them for rest, and half an hour more sometime before they left work. < They appeared healthy, clean and strong; and laboured cheerfully, because when they were employed, each of them received, as extraordinary pay, three farthings a day. They were distinguished from other labourers by a light chain on their legs. Their common allowance was two pounds and a half of bread and four farthings a day. I heard them called over, and saw them receive their pay, before they entered their chambers in the castle. Their bread was sweet and good. They were treated with humanity, though under strict discipline; were well supplied with food and clothes; had two shirts, two pair of dockings, &c. and they lay in good beds with coverlets (fee page 33', in large airy rooms having opposite windows, and not, like many convi<fts, in close dirty dungeons, under the fortifications.

was one pound and six ounces for a penny. Inferior forts made of rye were cheaper. At Dresden, the prices were, white bread, 18 oz.; householi, 2 lb.; rye bread, 2 lb. u ez. and half — for one grosche, or seven farthings. — The bakers at Vienna are punished for frauds by the severity and disgrace of the ducking-stool. This machine of terror, fixed on the side of the Danube, is a kind of long pole or board extending over the water, at one end of which the delinquent, being fattened in his balket, is immersed. The bakers would gladly purchase a removal of this machine, but the punishment is continued, and inflicted on delinquents by order of the magistrates.

Two wheels were fixed in the lighter, one of them to draw back the scoop or bucket, and the other (by the weight of ten men treading in it) to raise the mud, which was then emptied into another lighter managed by the overseer of the work. Three or four times a day, a soldier (with a bayonet fixed on his musket) accompanied a convict, who went to fetch a tub of fresh water, and on his return he supplied each with a tumbler of it while they were at work in the wheel. By the matt of the other lighter, a fail was spread to ftiade them, the weather being very warm, Farenheit's thermometer 85°.

ITALY.

X entered Italy in 1778 with raised expectations of considerable information, from a careful attention to the prisons and hospitals, in a country abounding with charitable institutions and public edifices.

At Venice, the chief prison is near the Doge's palace*, and it is one of the strongest I ever saw. There were between three and four hundred prisoners, many of them confined in loathsome and dark cells for life; executions here being very rare. There was no fever, or prevailing disorder in this close prison. None of the prisoners had irons. On weighing the bread allowance, I found it fourteen ounces,. I asked some who had been confined many years in dark cells, whether they should prefer the galleys ? They all answered in the affirmative: so great a blessing is light and air! The chapel is for the condemned, who continue there a night and a day before execution.

Regulations were hung up in the prison. — Here is a charitable society established for the relief of prisoners both civil and criminal, and rules are published for the dirediom of the officers who have the management of it, of whom four are appointed visiton of the prison. There are likewise rules for the good government of the two infirmaries. These I procured from the ducal printer, with the regulations for the galleys and pri — foils, for many years past.

One of the galleys was moored two boats length from the shore, in which were only* twenty-seven Haves, who were kept here in order to be font on board the other galleys.. This was clean. Here, and in the other galleys, which were dirty and crowded, the-slaves were in chains of about twenty-foven pounds weight. I saw a slave dead on the-shore, who I suppose destroyed himself in despair; as he could have no hope of an efoape by swimming, because of his heavy irons.-

I visited the prisons of Padua and Ferrara. In the former of these cities, none of the confined debtors would fit on the elevated stone jlool in the great hall: and I was. informed that not one had submitted to the ignominy these ten years -f*.

The rooms for the state prisoners are over part of the palace on the leads,-which renders confinement in; the heat of summer almost intolerable.

f This is sometimes called the Jione of disgrace; for if they who are insolvent would avoid imprisonment, at a time fixed they must fit upon it in a disgraceful manner three times.

Sect. IV. ITALY. 107

At Bologna are three prisons; one of which is for debtors, who are alimented after four months and three days confinement, at one paule (about sixpence) a, day each.

The Hospital, S. Marla de Vita, afforded me great pleasure. All was clean; and the wards were lofty, and not in the least offensive. The wards of the men and women were of the same size, each containing thirty-eight beds, nineteen on each side. The bedsteads were of iron, and the coverlets were white and clean. Each ward had fourteen windows, seven on a side, and all had curtains. They had folding wooden casements; and on the outside,- wire lattices. The wards of this hospital were thirty-two feet and a half wide, and the beds were three feet two inches wide, and three feet eight inches asunder. In the middle of each space of the wall between the beds was a cupboard, with a shelf, concealed by a small curtain; and over each curtain was a flip of black marble with the number of the bed. On the sides of all the wards, for the convenience of opening and shutting the windows, was a gallery eighteen feet above the floor, and two feet broad, with an iron rail two feet nine inches high. The doors to the wards were iron grates, five feet five inches wide.

In Florence are two prisons In the great Trifon, Palazzo degV Otto, were only twenty prisoners. Six of them were in the Jecvete chambers, which are twenty-one strong rooms. None of the prisoners were in irons. They had mattresses to lie on. Their bread was good. In the torture chamber, there was a machine for decollation, which prevents that repetition of the stroke which too often happens when the axe is used.

In the other Prison, Belle Stinche, there are five doors to pass before you come to the court. The opening of the first is three feet wide, and four feet nine inches high, with an inscription over it, Oportet mifereri, (We ought to be compassionate.) In this prison are many spacious rooms, in which are small branches to lie on. The men's rooms are below, and look into the court, which is about forty-three feet square. The women, entirely separated, are up stairs, and have an hospital joining to their room. A new infirmary for the men (forty-four feet by twenty-nine) is contiguous to the chapel. In this prison were forty-two men and fourteen women. Debtors were not separated from criminals. In one room were eight, who paid for their beds. The bread was good: the daily allowance to each, fifteen ounces. None were in irons. The chaplain has apartments, and resides in the gaol. — This prison has something similar to the plan I proposed. A wall surrounds three sides of it; but being very high, and only eleven feet and a half distant, renders the prison too close.

Dr. Targiont, who had an order from his Royal Highness to inspect the hospitals, and report what beneficial improvements might be made in them, accompanied me in visiting these prisons.

The great Hospital of S. Maria Nova was crowded, and too close; though the men*s fever ward was four hundred and fifty-four feet long, and thirty feet and a half wide. They have separate wards for wounds and fractures. The women are attended by the nuns, who have a passage under ground from the opposite convent. Here are twenty students, who lodge and board in the house for seven years, attend the sick, serve the victuals, &c . and are distinguished by a long cloak.

But the Hospital which I most frequently visited, was & Giovan di Dio. The afcentr into the sick ward is by a flight of thirty stone steps. This ward was lofty and clean; and was a hundred and twenty-three feet long, and thirty-three and a half wide. There were in it thirty-three beds, three feet four inches wide, placed on varnished boards, on iron bedsteads. This is very conducive to cleanliness, and secures patients from vermin. — Atone end there are five rooms with lingle beds for sick priests. Three of them were occupied. Neither the Tides nor floors of this, and the other hospitals of Italy, were wood, that being more retentive of feents or infection than

tarras or brick.--- The great attention of this order of friars to the sick, in every.

country where they have hospitals, does them honour.

The Hospital S. Paolo della Convalescenza, for the reception of recovering patients, has clean and airy apartments, and a spacious refectory, or dining-hall. They continue here four days, and by the change of air and diet their health is confirmed before they go to their several occupations.

Here I would just mention an Alms-looufs, S. Bcnifazio, for infirm persons of advanced age. It had eighty beds for each sex, and they were fitting up twenty more. The wards are thirty feet wide, all clean, and shewed the care of the nuns: who attend on this charity fv

In the Prison at Leghorn were three debtors, and eight of those called prisoners: at large, and in the secrete three criminals. I mention this prison because of the infirmary, which, as appears by an inscription over the door, was built at the expence of the present governor, Philip Borbonioy in 17.61-

The slaves in the Fortress £ appeared healthy and well; better, as the old keeper remarked, since they have lain on Shore. — Galleys or hulks ought to be the punishment

I saw a friar or capuchin come in form and Pless the meat or soup for dinner. The numerous patients seemed entirely satisfied with this, without any devotion of their own.

f I cannot leave Florence without expressing my great obligations to the Grand Duke for his permission to inspect the prisons, and ^making my acknowledgments to Sir Horace Mann our ambassador, for his very kind attention and assistance.

x In this Fortress, there were a hundred and thirty-two slaves; at Pisa, were eighty-five: and at the Grand Duke's salt-works at Port Ferrara, seventy.

only for the most atrocious crimes. — Each prisoner had a ring round one leg; Lichorn but when they go out to work, a chain is rivetted to two prisoners. Here were seven pontons to clear the harbour; but the weather, when I was there, being stormy, they could not be worked. There were forty-seven Haves employed at the new Lazaretto, which is a noble spacious building, with different apartments for officers and their-men to perform quarantine, and large warehouses for the cargoes of Their ships

The keeper generously ordered his son to copy for me all the rides, from which.

I shall here give some extracts.

Three keepers have their salary from the Grand Duke. They receive a copy of the process against every convict, carry it to the government, and register it in the proper book; and when required, they mu ft give an exact account of all proceedings against the prisoners. They make a report of the refractory to government, that they may be punished in proportion to their offences, with severer confinement, irons, and bastinadoes. The principal keeper has power to choose two turnkeys out of the best-behaved prisoners, who are to exhort and instruct the others: but the keeper is. to have a Jlrift zvatch over them. He must order that all prisoners, when they are brought in, have their heads shaved — be dressed in the uniform of the house — and have irons on their feet.

The prisoners are condemned to labour, for thirty, twenty, ten, or seven years, or for a shorter term, according to the nature of their crimes; and are chiefly employed on the public works. They are sent out every morning, under a guard of soldiers, and are chained two and two together, with a chain of about eighteen pounds weight. An hour's relaxation is allowed them at breakfast, and two hours in the afternoon: and at an hour before sun-set, they are reconducted to the prison; and must be well searched by the keepers, to prevent their having any thing concealed; and two hours after sun-set, they are ordered to go quietly to rest. When they are employed on the works by his royal highness,. they are paid two crazzies-(about three halfpence) a day; but if employed by other persons* they are paid four or six crazzies, according to the nature of the work. At day-break, the turnkeys ring the bell to awake them: and a report is made by them to the keepers, if any have been guilty of irregularities during the night. Their daily allowance is a loaf of thirty ounces, which is made two thirds of flour, and one third of bran -f-, and soup made from four ounces of pease boiled in water,. with salt and oil. On each of the two Easter holydays they are allowed a pound of meat, and three ounces of rice. Every two years they have a coat, of gray cloth, a waistcoat of red cloth.

I with some future traveller would give us plans of this Lazaretto, and that at Ancona and other places, as they might suggest some useful alterations in the construction of our hospitals and other public buildings.

and a red cap; every year a pair of shoes; and every six months a shirt, and a pair of drawers or breeches. Their drawers are shifted once a month, their shirts every week. For lodging, they have a mattress filled with straw, and a coverlet: the straw is changed, and kept in good order. — If one attempts to desert, and be taken before sun-set, he must wear a ring, and a chain of eighteen pounds weight; and he must pay half his future earnings, till it amounts to a zechin, to those that apprehended him *. If they who are condemned for five years, desert, when retaken, their term again commences: and for repeated desertions, they are more severely punished, and sometimes tortured.

The chaplain must inJlruEi the prisoners.

In the hospital there must be all proper provisions for the sick and infirm, viz. veal, mutton, rice, fine bread, broth, good wine, &c. A physician attends, and the diet and medicines must be according to his prescription. On entering, the patients have clean linen, shirts, night-caps, and clothes. And the keepers and turnkey must examine their victuals and soup, to see that they be good, and that the quantity be according to the physician's orders f.

On the ground-floor; on one side are the slaves for the galleys at Civita-veccKia-: on the other side is a sort of cook's shop, and a tap-room, over which are the women's-apartments, five of whom were in the secrete chambers, and twenty more at large. — There are eighteen of these strong rooms for the men, which are close and offensive, each of them having but one window for admitting air and light. These rooms are never opened without an order from the governor of the city. There were sixty-eight prisoners. They are not permitted to go out of their rooms at any time, but-for examination. Some having been confined there many years, appeared with pale sickly countenances; but none were in irons. — Here is a chamber for distracted' prisoners, in which were seven miserable objects. There are several chambers with beds for those who are called prisoners at large, for which each pays one paule and a half (about eight pence) a night. There is a chamber for priejls, one for boys, one for Jews, and one for prisoners who have' cutaneous disorders. — On.the upper-floor are two infirmaries: one, appropriated to the prisoners in the secrete, in which were four patients. In the other, which is for the rest of the prisoners, were ten patients the first time I was there, and the last time only seven. This infirmary is a spacious airy ward, seventy-three feet by twenty-three, with seventeen beds, three feet three inches asunder; was clean, and had every thing proper for the sick. The whole prison is arched with brick, for security in case of fire. The passages are seven feet two inches wide, and light. The ascent to each story, is by two flights of seventeen stone steps. These staircases are seven feet three inches wide; the rises five inches: this I mention, as generally, in our prisons (even those that are lately built) the stairs are narrow, the rises high, and the passages dark and inconvenient.

ie a table of regulations by the authority of the magistrates hung up in this prison, ordering the exa<ft times, of opening the prison and the court of saying mass daily, and of distributing the alms. The times vary twice in a month, according to the different length of the days. In the same table, the physician is ordered to visit the sick in the infirmary every morning; and in case of extraordinary illness, in the evening. — I wish I could say I had fcen no torture-chamber. — On the side of the great prison there is a pulley and rope (fee the plate) to draw up malefactors by their hands which are tied behind them; after they have been suspended some time, by being suddenly let down part of the way, their arms are dislocated*.

In the Prison at the Capital, are two rooms for debtors, and for criminals whose offences are not so great as to cause them to be confined in the secrete. The prisoners in one of these rooms, have the privilege of asking alms of the passengers. There

were five debtors in rooms which they paid for, and two criminals in the secrete. This prison is not offensive. There is a constant current of water through one of the large rooms.

The (late prisoners are confined in the castle of San Angelo. The rooms appropriated to that purpose were all empty, except one, in which was a bishop, who had been confined upwards* of twenty years, and was distracted. Here were also eighteen con-dannati who work in the fortress, and had each a light chain. They seemed healthy and well. — On the death of the Pope, the prisoners are brought hither from the great prison, for upon such occasions the prisons are thoroughly cleaned.

I can give but little information respecting the prison of the inquisition. It is

situated near the great church of St. Peter's. On one side of the court round which

it is built, is the inquisitor-general's palace. Over the gate is an inscription importing " that it was erected by Pope Pius V. in the year 1569." The windows of the prison have wooden blinds, and at a small distance is a high wall. The chambers of this silent and melancholy abode were quite inaccessible to me: and yet I spent near two hours about the court and the priests apartments, till my continuance there began to raise suspicion.

There is an account of this mode of punishment at Rome in Dr. Moore's View of Society and Manners in Italy, vol. I. p. 476, third edit. This Letter (44th.) is well worth perusing, in which the ingenious writer describes the manner of execution at Rome, with pertinent remarks, and concludes with these questions. " When criminals are carried to execution with little or no solemnity, amidst the shouts of an unconcerned rabble, who applaud them in proportion to the degree of indifference and impenitence they display, and consider the whole scene as a source of amusement; how can such exhibitions make any " useful impression, or terrify the thoughtless and desperate from any wicked propensity ? If there is a " country in which great numbers of young inconsiderate creatures are, six or eight times every year, carried to execution in this tumultuous, unaffecting manner, might not a stranger conclude, that the view

of the legislature was to cut off guilty individuals in the least alarming way possible, that others might " jrot be deterred from following their example ?M

Sect. IV. ITALY.

In this City, as in most parts of Italy, is a Confraternita della misericordia, called

S. Giovanni di Fiorentini: as many of Florentine extraction were the founders. This institution is ancient, for the church of S. Gio Batlijla Decollato belonged to them in 1450. It consists of about seventy, chiefly nobles, of the belt families. After a prisoner is condemned, one or two of them come to him the midnight before his execution, inform him of the sentence, and continue with him till his death. They, with the confessor, exhort and comfort him, and give him his choice of the most delicious food. All the fraternity attend the execution, dressed in white. When the prisoner is dead, they leave him hanging till the evening; then one of the fraternity, generally a noble, cuts him down, and orders him to be conveyed to the burying-place which they have appropriated to malefactors. I was there the twenty-ninth of August, the only day in the year when this burying-place is opened to the public. Adjoining to an elegant church is a chapel, which makes one side of a court, and on each of the other three sides, is a portico supported by doric pillars. In the middle of the pavement* of the front portico the women, and in one of the side porticos the men are buried. The latter are interred in the same dress in which they were hanged i for in Italy, coffins are not in general use.

The Hospital of S. Michele is a large and noble edifice. The back front is near three hundred yards long. It consists of several courts with buildings round them. In the apartments on three sides of one of the most spacious of these courts, are rooms for various manufactures-and arts, in which boys who are orphans or destitute are educated and instructed. When I was there, the number was about two hundred, all learning different trades according to their different abilities and genius. Some were educated for printers, some for book-binders, designers, smiths, carpenters, tailors, ffioe-makers, and barbers; and some for weavers and dyers, a cloth manufacture being carried on here in all its branches. When the boys arrive at the age of twenty years, they are completely clothed, and a certain sum is given to set them up in the business they have learned. In the middle of the court is a noble fountain, and several inscriptions to the honour of the founders of this excellent institution.

Adjoining to another court are apartments for the aged and infirm, in which were two hundred and sixty men, and two hundred and twenty-six women. Here they find a comfortable retreat, having clean rooms and a refectory. I conversed with some of them, and they- appeared happy and thankful.

Here are marble Hones, in which are circular apertures' for the interment of those that are executed. Round these Hones is inscribed,

" Domine, cum veneris judicare,

" Noli nos condemnare."

O Lord, when thou Shalt come to judge, do not condemn us.

There are in Rome many Hospitals for the sick, but they were in general crowded, yet none of them had more than one patient in a bed. In the great hospital of San Spirito in SaJJia, there were, die first time I visited it, a thousand and fifteen patients, the second time eleven hundred and three. Formerly many nations founded hospitals in this city. This was founded by one of our Saxon kings. Some others continue to the present ume entirely national, as the Milanese, Florentine, and Spanish hospitals..

Here is a staircase remarkable for its ascent being very easy, for valetudinarians, and for carrying up the sick in a kind of chairs or enclosed beds. It is seven feet wide, and has a rail on each side. Every step is an inclined plane of three inches ascent, one foot eight inches wide, and the rife from one step to another is only three inches. Theft: steps are of brick, set edgeways, and fronted with stone.

The Hospital of S. Gio Laterano was also crowded and offensive; and that of S. Giacomo degl' Incurabili was worse *: but that called Benfratelli, that for the Florentines, that of S. Maria della Confolazione, were clean, and perfectly free from any offensive scents. In this last mentioned hospital, no patients are received except such as have wounds or fractures. At night, two chains are put across the street over-against this hospital, by an order of Pope Alexander VII. in 1661, for the purpose elegantly expressed in the inscription,

NE PK/ETEREUNTE STREPITU QUIES AMICA SILENTII OMNINO AB /3EGROTANTIBUS EXULARET.

Before we take our leave of Rome, it may be proper just to mention the Hospital for pilgrims and convalescents. Recovering patients, when dismissed from the other hospitals, may enter into this, and reside here three days, lodge in airy wards, dine in the refectory, and be well attended.

The Pope's galleys are at Civita-vecchta. The slaves condemned to them are confined for different terms, according to the nature of their crimes: but the shortest time is three years for vagabonds, who are generally employed on board the pontons in clearing the harbour. For theft, the term is never under seven years. Persons convicted of forgery are always confined for life; and if found guilty of forging banknotes, or any instruments by which large sums have been loft, they are punished with 2n iron glove. Prisoners for life are chained two and two together: those for limited terms have all a single chain, and, at their first arrival, of the same weight; but when they have no more than one or two years to serve, they have only a ring round their leg, which is lessened as the end of their term approaches. For escapes, they are obliged

to finifti their first condemnation, and then receive a fresh one for the same time as th e former; but if the first was for life, the same is renewed, and they receive from a hundred to two hundred lathes a day, for three days after their arrival. None are sent to the galleys under the age of twenty: criminals of a younger age are kept at the hospital of S. Michele in Rome till they are of age; and are there employed in spinning, and fed on bread and water.

The allowance to each slave is three pounds of bread a day; and fifty-five pounds of beans or calavances to each galley, with which they generally make a kind of soup once in two or three days, and they are allowed two pounds and a half of oil to boil with their beans. At Easter} Christmas, and Carnival, they are allowed one pound of beef and half a pint of wine a man, and twenty-five pounds of rice to a galley.

For their clothing, they have once in two years, a striped woollen capotto and waistcoat, two shirts, two pair of canvass breeches, and a woollen cap; and every year, two feet and a half of woollen cloth to wrap round their legs instead of stockings. The yearly expence of each slave for maintenance, clothing, and chains, is computed at fifteen Roman crowns and eighty-seven baiocs, about:x3: 9-

At the time of my being at Civita-vecchia, three of the galleys were out on a cruise, and two only remained. Through the whole night there was great silence, (as I lay in a felucca close to them) though about four hundred were chained in each of the galleys.

The saves here are constantly employed, and have a portion of what they earn for themselves, being paid according to their abilities and the nature of their work. For sawing in the arsenal, they are paid two pence a day each; for working as masons, two pence halfpenny; for carrying stones and mortar, only a penny. Such as work at the canvass and calico manufactories, are paid from two pence to eight pence, according to the quality of the work, &c. At the public works they are allowed an hour for dinner, and in summer-time an hour for breakfast*.

Here is a spacious hospital on floor e for the slaves. None were in irons. All was clean. In the centre of the great room in this infirmary was an altar for public worship. A particular room was appropriated for such as had cutaneous disorders, and another for consumptive patients. In this country, the physicians are persuaded that the consumption is a contagious disorder. Patients afflicted with it in hospitals have a separate ward. The same precautions are used to prevent infection as in the plague. When this disorder has been in private houses, the furniture is destroyed, and the rooms are scraped and fumigated, before they are again inhabited.

For the preceding account I am indebted to our countryman Mr. Denham, who has the superintendence of the pope's galleys.

Sect.IV. ITALY. 117

The principal Prison in the great and populous city of Naples*is La Vicaria, under the courts of justice. It contained, when I was there, according to the gaoler's account, nine hundred and eighty prisoners. In about eight large rooms communicating with one another, there were five hundred and forty sickly objects, who had access to a court surrounded by buildings so high as to prevent the circulation of air. In this court was a recess, under arcades like those that were under the chapel at Newgate. Some of the prisoners were employed in knitting, and others in making shoes; but most of them were entirely without employment. In six chambers, which opened into a spacious hall, were many beds for such as could pay for them. Adjoining was a chapel, and a spacious infirmary for the whole prison; in which were forty persons, in single beds, with sheets, coverlets, &c. j- In seven close offensive rooms were thirty-one prisoners, almost without clothes on account of the great heat; and in six dirty rooms communicating with one another were fifty women. Of all the prisoners, one man only was in irons, in a dungeon, near a small chapel which is allotted to the condemned before execution.

The bread was good: the daily allowance to each was twenty-two ounces.

There were three other Prisons: one contained eighty prisoners, another near sixty, the other but eleven. 0

The Galleys were moored about ten feet from the shore. In the first were two hundred and sixty slaves; in the second two hundred and ninety-eight; in the third two hundred and seventy; and in the fourth, four hundred; most of them flout and healthy. All were chained two and two together. Their bread was hard, but sweet. About twenty-six ounces a day was allowed them; and when employed in the arsenal and other public works, they have an extraordinary allowance of near a penny a day. After escapes, if they are retaken, their whole term is doubled. Each galley has a chaplain, and public worship on Sundays and holydays.

An account is taken every year of the inhabitants of this city; and at Easttr 1777, their number, exclusive of soldiers and marines, was 350,061, viz.

Males 170,574 Females 165,642 Priests 3303 Monks 4231 Nuns 6311

Of this number there were born in the year immediately preceding, 6029 males, and 5571 females. The deaths in that year were 9553.

f In visiting the prisons of Italy, I observed, that in general great attention was paid to the sick; but I could not avoid remarking, that too little care was taken to prevent sickness.

From the heat of the climate, one might imagine the gaol-fever would be very likely to prevail; but, I did not find it in any of the prisons.

Naples Alms-house.

Hospitals.

In the Seraglio, or great Alms-house there were about five hundred and fifty prisoners fcondannati) in eight or nine rooms. Many of them work as labourers on this great building, with chains varying according to the terms of their confinement, and have the extra allowance just mentioned, with five ounces of flour for soup. In these rooms were shoe-makers at work, as in some of the galleys, but most of the prisoners had no employment f.

This great building is to; be a receptacle for the aged and infirm, and for beggars and idle persons. There is a great number of the former in some rooms that are finished, and which have windows into a court, where they were digging a foundation for a large church, by which the numerous inhabitants will be deprived of the salutary effects of die circulation of air.

The galley-slaves have an hospital on the Shore fronting the bay, entirely appropriated to them and their guards J. It has four or five spacious and airy wards, cleaner than most of the other hospitals in this city. One of these rooms is only for the guard of the marine. The patients are distinguished into three clafies; very ill — sick — and recovering. Great attention is paid to them: and they are allowed good bread in sufficient quantity.

The great and crowded Hospitals of S. Apostoli and UAnnunziazione, have wards appropriated to the cure of wounded persons ((.

The Hospital of the Benfratelli, or S. Gio di Dio, is clean and elegant. It consists chiefly of one lofty ward; at one end of which is an altar and a room for poor priests; and at the other end, a table, on which are placed the patients victuals. Near this table was inscribed a reference to the apposite words of Scripture, Matthew xxv. 35, 36. For I was an hungred, and ye gaye me meat: &c.

The front of this building already extends near thirteen hundred feet, and probably it will be enlarged.

f As no regular plan had been settled for the employment of these llaves, the king lately made a present of three hundred of such of them as had been condemned for life, to the Maltese.

I On my telling the surgeon, that in some countries a part of each galley is made an hospital (alluding in my mind to our Hulks); he replied,c* that must soon make the whole an hospital."

II The frequency of assaults and assassinations in Italy is generally known. Many of the common people seem to be ignorant or insensible of the atrociousness of the crime of murder. The criminals in prison express, with seeming satisfaction of mind, " that though they (tabbed they did not rob." If we consider that wards and even hospitals appropriated to the wounded are filled with patients, that the prisons are crowded, and -that many are continually taking refuge on the Heps of churches, and examine our accounts in JanJJin's Lifts and the Judges Returns, we may reckon that there are more murders committed in a year in the city of Naples or Rome, than in Great Britain and Ireland. Does not this prove that the English are not naturally cruel ? And might not arguments be derived from hence, for the revisal and repeal of some of our sanguinary laws ? The Marquis Beccaria justly remarks, in Chap. 28. that " the death of a criminal " is a less efficacious method of deterring others, than the continued example of a man deprived of his " liberty." — And that u the punishment of death is pernicious to society, fr.om the example of barbarity it M affords."

Sect. IV. ITALY.

In many of the Italian hospitals, and in all that I have seen belonging to this order of friars, there are no rooms over the sick wards, so that they are as lofty as our churches or chapels.

At Lucca, they formerly sold their condannati to the Genoese or Venetians, but now Lucca. they keep them in prison without any employment.

At Genoa, besides a Prison for debtors, and a Prison for female criminals, there is a Genoa great Prison for male criminals, consisting of thirty-five rooms tolerably airy. I saw none Prisons* of the prisoners in irons. Their daily allowance was thirteen ounces of good wheaten bread for each, besides soup. To this prison belongs an hospital, and a chapel with a large room to which the condemned are brought four days before their execution. —

The instructions formed for this prison by the supreme fyndies, are hung up in it, and contain excellent regulations, as will appear from the following account of a few of them.

" The keeper shall have under him six assistants and the said keeper is to be responsible, and liable to punishment, if any of the assistants shall be guilty of the least fraud or neglect in their employment. — The advocate fiscal is once a week, at any time he shall think proper, but when he is least exfeEled, to visit the cells of the prison, and to inquire diligently how the prisoners are treated by the keeper and assistants, in order to give information to the most serene senate, &c. — When any prisoner is condemned to death, he is immediately to be put into chains. — The keeper is always to keep the chapel shut, except at the time of celebrating mass, confession, or administering consolation to the unhappy. — He is also to take care that the prisoners do not play at any games., particularly cards. The last order is, that this table of regulations be fixed up in the criminal court of justice, in the chancery, and in the apartments of the criminals."

In one of the Galleys just returned from conveying some noblemen to their country Galled. feats, I found about three hundred stout fellows, clean and healthy: for the old and infirm had been left in the galleys at home, of which there were only two, the other, two being out on a cruise.

The hospital for these galleys is on floore; and in it are hung up the regulations, which consist chiefly of such orders as the following:

" That five superintendents shall be appointed by the magistrates, who every month shall draw lots, to determine which of the galleys they are to inspect. — That exact lists of the crews, and of the sick in the infirmary, with an account of die time of their ad million, shall be taken and kept, with the assistance of the physician, chaplain, and surgeon. — That the secretary shall keep a register of all things necessary to be provided; bread, wine, meat, pease,. beans, rice, &c. &c. — That four caldrons of broth shall be allowed weekly to a galley, besides kettles of broth statediy given them in the three winter months. — That when the superintendents discontinue the allowance of meat, cheese, oil, and stockfish, the chaplain shall see that each of the slaves be served daily

with half a pint of wine. — That the physicians shall keep exact accounts of their orders of meat, wine, pastry, &c. — That the captains and midshipmen shall take care that all the regulations be exactly observed."

The Turkish (laves had many little (hops on shore, For selling coffee, perfumes, &c. and for (having; like those I remember to have seen about fifteen years since at Mar-feilles. The bread allowance to the slaves is three pounds and a half, for two days in summer; and three pounds in winter.

In the great Hospital there were about three hundred men, and six hundred women. All sick persons of any nation are admitted into it; and it is one of the best and least offensive of the public hospitals of Italy. Here was a room and ward for foundlings, crowded and close , and the poor infants were cruelly bound hands and feet with bandages, as in the hospital at Florence, and other cities in Italy.

There were also in this hospital apartments for the insane. These apartments were close and dirty; and the calm and quiet, I found inhumanly confined in the same room with the noisy and turbulent.

The Albergo hospital, situated on an eminence within fight of the harbour, is an asylum for boys and girls. There were in it a hundred and seventeen of the former, and four hundred and eighty-two of the latter. It is something similar to the noble and well-regulated hospital of San Michele at Rome. Over the door of the great room, where numbers were spinning and weaving, is this inscription:

Silentium et Obedientia.

At Milan, in the great Prison, there are twenty secrete chambers. The general size of these rooms is eleven feet by twelve to fifteen. In some were only one or two persons, but in others six or eight: the windows are towards a high wall eleven feet distant. These are some of the strongest*: and most retired rooms in the Italian prisons, in which the most atrocious offenders, and those who are imprisoned for life, are confined. They are inaccessible but by a special order. The entrance is guarded by two doors, between which is a narrow space, just sufficient to admit two persons. Into this you are locked before the turnkey opens the inner door, for fear these desperate criminals should murder the keeper for the keys, and attempt to rush out.

In the Prison for debtors, in this great trading city, there were only four persons confined for debt.

There are two prisons called L'Argaftro> and La Casa di Correzioney which do honour to the country. Both are for criminals, condemned either for a term of years, or for life. The most atrocious, work in chains in the street; the others, only in the house.

In L'ArgaJlro there were three hundred and fifty-nine prisoners, healthy and strong. A considerable number of them were at work in public: they water the streets and public walks (at the expence of the city) there being nineteen small waggons for that purposej six men draw, and one attends behind chained. Others repair the pavements, &c. But in the house there were at work shoe-makers, tailors, smiths,

GERMANY.

From Switzerland I returned to Germany in 1778, in order to visit some prisons which I had not seen in my former journies, particularly those in the free or Imperial Cities.

[Augsburg.]

At Augsburg, the prison is on the side of a hill, at the back of the town-house. It consists of many cachots or small rooms, on three different floors. There is one for examination, and two for the engines of torture. There are also two dark dungeons for such as have been convicted of witchcraft: but they are in a very ruinous condition, and seem to have been a long time without inhabitants. — The condemned are brought three days before their execution into two light rooms, which open into a Roman catholic chapel; where, however, if a prisoner be a Protestant, a Lutheran minister is permitted to attend him.

The House of Correction consists of buildings on two sides of a spacious court; one side for those of the Roman catholic religion, and the other for Protestants, with a chapel for each. The rooms were all clean, and are white-washed every year.

Opposite to the front windows in most of the rooms, were high windows, of a semi-circular form, which were designed for promoting a circulation of air.

At Munich or Munchen, there are two prisons for criminals. One, in the Mu nice, town-house, had in it six men and two women prisoners *. In a dark damp dungeon down seventeen steps, were the instruments of torture.

The other, La Prison de la Cour, consisted of about fifteen cells, twelve feet by seven, and a black torture-room. In this room there is a table covered with black cloth and fringe. Six chairs for the magistrates and secretaries, covered also with black cloth, are elevated two steps above the floor, and painted black. Various engines of torture, some of which are stained with blood, hang round the room.

When the criminals suffer, the candles are lighted; for the windows are shut close, to prevent their cries being heard abroad. Two crucifixes are presented to the view of the unhappy objects. But it is too (hocking to relate their different modes of 'Cruelty. Even women are not spared "f~.

Once a year, 'viz. on All-faints, day, any persons are permitted to enter and see the prison. There is a custom similar to this in Holland, at the fair time.

+ This room seems much like the torture-room in Spain, described in LimborcVs Hifiory of the In-guiftian, translated by Chandler, vol. II. page 221, 4W. edit. " It was a large under-ground room,

In the house of correction were about forty men and thirty women; some weaving wide cloth, but most of them spinning. The keeper ordered his servant to attend me with charcoal and frankincense; a certain sign of negligence and inattention, which the countenances of the prisoners confirmed.

I was agreeably relieved from the pain excited by these scenes, with the view of the two Hospitals of Les Frereg and Les Soeurs de Charite. In the former wrere about forty beds; in the latter, twenty: the wards were about twenty-six feet wide. All was neat and clean, dill and quiet; and the great attention paid to the patients was every where apparent. I saw the operation of bleeding performed by the nuns with great dexterity and tenderness. Over the foot of each bed a text of Scripture was inscribed, as in some Italian hospitals.

The prison at Ratisbon or Regensburg, is in the town-house. Many of the chambers are airy, and most of them have stoves. There are no dungeons, but three dark cellars for torture, at which two senators, their secretary, and the hangman with his valets assist. At Munich and most other places, a surgeon also attends; but I heard of no such custom here.

At the back of the orphan-house (in which were twenty boys and fifteen girls) is the house of correction; here I found only two women.

At Nurenburg, the prison is under the town-house. There are fifteen steps down to the gaoler's kitchen. The apertures for admitting light into the passages of the dungeons, are level with the ground. This is one of the worst prisons I ever saw. The dark unhealthy dungeons, and the dismal torture* chamberdo no honour to the magistracy of this city. — The gaoler makes use of a low trick to prevent the escape of his prisoners, by terrifying them with the apprehensions of falling under the power of witches. In several of the German gads there are dungeons for those that are accused of witchcraft, but they seem to have been long disused; and I hope increasing light and good sense will soon entirely banifti the fears of witches, and consequently the witches themselves.

In one of the city-towers in which lunatics are confined, there are three or four rooms for criminals of higher rank.

" arched, and the walls covered with black hangings. The candlesticks were fattened to the walk " and the whole room enlightened with candles placed in them.. — The inquisitor and notary fat at " a table, so that the place seemed as the very mansion of death, every thing appearing so terrible " and awful."

In this chamber on the wall is inscribed a gingling verse, which I. here insert, as perhaps no traveller but myself has ever seen it:

Ad mala fatrata, hac sunt atra thealra far at a. 1753-

Sect. IV. GERMANY.

Over the gate of the House of Correction at Nurenburg is this inscription:

Hie criminum frequentia Mortalium dementia Compefcitur clementia Salva fori sententia.

The prisoners were employed in grinding spectacle-glasses. The surplus of what they earn above forty creutzers, or eighteen pence a week each, they are allowed for themselves. The men grind seven glasses in each hand. Some grind four hundred in a week, by which they earn fifty-two creutzers at thirteen for a hundred, and consequently each earns for himself twelve creutzers a week *. Some of the women were working gold and silver lace on cushions.

At Schwabach, in the margraviate of Anfpach, is a large house of correction, in which were ninety-three prisoners. Some men here also were grinding glasses in two large rooms , and others, in different apartments, were employed in polishing steel buttons for clothes, wire-drawing and making spinning-wheels: and I was informed that twelve were at work on the road. The women were spinning, the daily talk injoined to each was six creutzers, or two pence halfpenny.

Such prisoners as have been publicly whipped are called infames, and are distinguished from the rest, by having a particular place appropriated to them -in the chapel, and by being made the last in receiving the sacrament. The chaplain resides in the house.

This house was clean, and well regulated. The gaoler readily supplied me with a book, containing an account of the regulations, &c. in which are some liberal and sensible remarks that appear worth transcribing.

It is observed, that " there is great error in expecting that a house of this kind i{ should be able to maintain itself; since with the ftrifleft oeconomy, a consideralfie " annual sum will be found necessary for its proper support."

The greatest attention to cleanliness is inculcated; bathing rooms are provided for the prisoners-, and the expence of washing for them is reckoned an object not to be regarded. — The necessity for ftek wards for both sexes is pointed out.

It is remarked to be te a very false notion, that a man who lives upon bread and water can work hard and be kept in health " accordingly, as will be seen in the tableSubjoined, a daily allowance of hot provisions is ordered for the criminals.

It is mentioned as an essential point to preserve order, and prevent abuses, " that " one of the city magistrates should every week in rotation visit the house, and closely " insped every thing relative to its management."

# That this is a very unhealthy business Is evident from the countenances of those whom I saw thus employed, and from the disagreeable sensations I alway received from the dull in the rooms where they were grinding. The medical gentlemen prescribe bleeding and physic to these persons two or three times a year.

The account of the daily allowance to the prisoners was hung up in the dining-room*.

In a large House of Correction near Bayreuth, in Franconia, the men were all working on marble, which is found in the neighbouring mountains. — Many were employed at the polishing bench, two on each flab. Others were variously engaged, in finishing, filing, or carving; or in cutting proofs or samples at the wheels; or in working on tobacco-boxes, snuff-boxes, &c. A large warehouse contained the goods they had finished. — Some specimens of the several forts of the marble I brought home. — In summer, many of them are employed in Tawing without doors *, but in winter, they work in rooms: for were they to attempt this work abroad, a sudden frost might endanger the materials, but would certainly render it impossible to use the saw. The pale countenances of the prisoners were a sign that their work was laborious, and that the keeper had the whole profit.

My ingenious friend and colleague, the late Dr. Fothergill, proposed a scheme of this kind for the employment of our convicts, and pointed out many of the advantages which might attend the execution. It was printed in the Gazetteer, Sept. 30, 1776.

The women were spinning worsted, and appeared objects of companion. Their dirty rooms, sickly looks, and cutaneous complaints, evidently bespoke inattention and neglect*.

In the House of correction at Wurtzburg were fifty-four men and thirty-six women employed in a well-regulated woollen manufactory. In one part of the house they were spinning; in another, picking and carding wool; and in another, weaving wide cloth for the soldiers, and also flocking and waistcoat pieces. The wheels were larger than our spinning-wheels, the diameter being four feet. Here, and at most houses of this fort, are large looms, six feet seven inches wide, and two persons work at each loom. In a warehouse, the manufacturer (for all such houses have a manufacturer) shewed me several pieces of cloth for the under officers, the artillery, the soldiers, and the hospital or poor-house. The women were all spinning or carding in one large room. As their spinning was of various kinds, there was a room with cupboards, where each person's work was laid up separately^ The talk for each man or woman was eight creutzers, or three pence halfpenny a day. Here is a Roman catholic chapel, and the priest lives in the house. — Roman catholic prisoners are sometimes sent hither from other countries, for their term of confinement, as those of a different persuasion are sent to Bayreuth.

At Hanau, the galley-slaves (so called) are distinguished into honnetes and deshonnetes. The former are condemned for three, four, seven, nine, fourteen years, according to their crimes; but the term is sometimes shortened on account of good behaviour. These wear a brown uniform; and a small chain from the girdle to one leg. The latter are such as have committed capital offences. These wear a white coat

I have a book of the regulations: but of what advantage are the bell rules when not enforced ? It may be of use, however, to give some idea of the nature of these regulations, which seem, on the whole, well planned. After mentioning that the two sexes are to be kept separate, and also the honnetes from the infamts; a chapter is given, treating on the Mean* of Correction, under three heads.

i. Religious inJlruElion, in which the Chaplain's duty is amply laid down. He is to read prayers twice a day, preach and catechise on Sundays, and employ the most solemn and earnest exhortations occasionally.

2. Labour. Idleness being justly considered as the source of most vices, great attention is paid to a constant employment of the prisoners. The nature of this employment has been mentioned in the text; but I think it proper to quote one observation from the book of regulations, which is, that it. is of advantage to have part of the work of a kind that any person, though incapable of the common labour, may be employed in it. Such is the turning of a wheel, which even a blind man may perform.

3. The various punishmenU of the refractory.

A subsequent chapter treats oh Diet, Clothing, and Cleanliness. The allowance is two-' pounds of wholesome bread daily, and something hot for dinner. Meat only on a few holidays. For the sick, there is an addition of four pfennings a day for board. All the money, however, is paid to the keeper, who finds the provisions. Concerning cleanliness it is observed', that the want of it not only occasions diseases of the body, but also tends to the corruption and debasement of the mind.

with one black flceve; and have a chain from the girdle to both legs: they never work out of the town; and are put to the most laborious and disagreeable employments in it. The hours of work for both forts are, in summer, from five to eleven, and from one to fix: in winter, as the weather and length of days permit. Allowance from ill of April to Michaelmas, two pounds and a half of bread a day: from Michaelmas to April, two pounds: and each man about two pence a day: and from a charity they have half a florin (about twelve pence halfpenny) a month. They are constantly vitited by a deputy from the regency, who makes his report to the colonel every morning.: and the colonel conveys it to the young prince, when he resides at Hanau. Of his kindness to them, the prisoners seemed duly sensible; and they spoke with grateful respect of the attention shewed them by the amiable Princess his deceased mother, whose memory will be long revered in that country.

I asked more than one of the honnetes who were at work on the road, whether they liked to be thus employed, or would choose to be confined in idleness? They readily answered, " Much rather be thus abroad at work." On Saturday afternoon these sweep the bridges, the entrances to the town, &c. They have a -guard of four soldiers (bayonets fixed) a subaltern, and the keeper. This is the guard, be the number of slaves more or less: when I favv them they were from ten to twelve.

At six in the evening, in summer-time, they bring all their tools into a room in the prison, and go to their chambers: the dishonnetes on the ground-floor; the honnetes above. But in this prison there is not a separate room for each man; as in those to which they were at first committed. Each slave has, besides the clothes above-mentioned, two pair of shoes; two pair of (lockings; and two shirts. All are obliged to attend divine service on Sunday. The men, on my repeated visits, looked healthy.

The deshonnetes are not doomed to despair: but for good behaviour are sometimes promoted to the rank of honnetes. I conversed with one, whom I found very cheerful for a late advancement of that kind: in consequence of it, he was working on the road.

There is another Prison, LdP'our de Margueretta: so called from the first person confined in it. It has four rooms on each of the two floors-, but they were all empty.

At Cassel, there is also a Prison for galley-slaves under similar management, but not so well conducted. One circumstance struck me as worthy of remark. In a new church just built, there is a gallery with two separate feats for the honnetes and deJJoonnetes; though the whole number, when I was there, was only seventeen.

Here is also a large House of correction, with a work-room one hundred and ten feet by twenty-five, and twelve feet high. It was built by Charles, grandfather to the present Landgrave. I shall not, however^ enter into a minute detail of the

Sect. IV. GERMANY.

discipline in this house, as many others are better conduced; and the account of them is more particular.

At Francfort (on the Maine) there are five Prisons. One is for debtors, where I found only three, who were alimented at ten creutzers, about fourpence a day, payable by their creditors.

The Prison called Ld Tour de St. Catharine was empty. Here is a lightsome room, to which criminals are generally brought from the great guard prison, just before their execution. The men are hanged, and the women beheacted; but executions are very rare in this city.

In the House of correction (near the work-house) were three prisoners, two women and a man. The man was at work with two or three others in the court, beating to powder a porous stone, which is worked up with water, and makes, when dry, a hard cement or coat of plaster. The two women were employed in the work-house.

At Manheim, Monsieur Babo, counsellor to the regency, very politely gave orders to shew me every room of Ld Maison de Force. Prisoners committed to this house are commonly received in form with what is called the bien-vend (welcome). A machine is brought out, in which are fattened their neck, hands, and feet. Then they are stripped; and have, according as the magistrate orders — the grand vend of twenty to thirty stripes — the demi vend of eighteen to twenty — or the petit vend of twelve to fifteen: after this they kiss the threshold and go in Some are treated with the same compliment at discharge. The like ceremony is observed at many other towns in Germany.

The house was clean. Fifty-two men, and forty-nine women in several rooms: all at work , either at their own trades, as shoe-makers, tailors, weavers, lapidaries; or at one of the manufactures of the house: which are coarse cloth and cards. Not, one idle. They have but little time to earn any thing for themselves: yet though, they work entirely for the house, their labour does, not maintain it.

The rules and orders are good. I have a copy of them. The two last are to this effect. nth. As it is of the utmost importance in such houses as this, to observe all possible cleanliness; it is required of all persons to watch most strictly against all appearance of the contrary. Whoever fees the lead offence of that kind, shall give immediate notice of it to the inspector., upon pain of close confinement on bread, and watery and the most rigorous chastisement. 12th. That no one may be. able to plead ignorance of the rules, one copy of them shall he given to every prisoner, and another hung up in his room; and they shall be read publicly every Sunday morning after divine service. It is ordered that the disobedient be punished; and that encouragement be given to the dutiful and diligent.

The doors are all numbered; and the keys marked with the corresponding number. Allowance to most of the men, two pounds of bread, soup, and a quart of good beer*, and, except in Lent, half a pound of meat. Women have a pound and half of bread r.

other articles as the men. The sick are indulged with white bread, veal, &rc. They have all of them clean linen once a week: it is washed by the women prisoners. The keeper makes, every morning, a report to Monsieur Babo of the Hate of the house as to numbers, health, &c.

A capuchin says mass in the chapel every morning. There is a gallery for men: another for women, with a blind before it: another for orphans, of whom there are sixty-four in a sort of hospital at one end of the prison. Protestants and Jews are ordered to their private devotions: the latter are excused from working on their sabbath.

At Strasburg, in one of the five towers were three debtors: they informed me that they were alimented by their creditors; that they had two pounds of good bread a day, and soup equally good. — I was much pleased to find so much of a liberal spirit prevail in this city, that in the hospital there were separate chambers for Lutherans, in which they were allowed the attendance of their own ministers.

At Mentz, La Porte de Fer for felons is five stories high: two rooms on a floor: a spacious landing-place in the middle, with opposite windows, for circulation of air. The rooms are double-floored with oak plank, full two inches thick; and each room has two doors, only three feet nine inches high. These circumstances contribute much to security. On one side the door is a small iron wicket, to give in the daily allowance; which is two pounds of bread, soup, and (except in Lent) a little meat. Only one prisoner is confined in each room, who has two blankets; and once in a fortnight, clean straw. This gaol Hands near the Rhine, and is not in the least offensive.

In the House of correction all was neat, and shewed the attention of the regency. On my taking notice to the keeper how clean his prison was, he said, " How can it be otherwise, when we have so many women prisoners ? Surely they must keep the te house clean ?" Most of the flour in the city is ground at a mill in this prison; at which the delinquents work two hours in the morning, and two in the afternoon. Over the door is carved a waggon drawn by two fags, two lions, and two wild boars; with an inscription explaining the device, which is, that if even wild beads can be tamed to the yoke, we should not despair of reclaiming irregular men. I saw the same bass relief at one or two other houses of correction.

There is a separate prison for debtors, La Porte du Poison, near the fish-market:

I found no prisoners in it. When there are any, they have daily at the creditor's cost: two pounds of bread, and about four pence in money.

Every prison at Mentz, has in each room, a German (love; which, in winter, is heated two or three times a day. Prisoners have clean linen once a week. On my taking notice to the brigadier of the police who went with me, how healthy his prisoners looked, he said that *c Some years ago, they were unhealthy; and the " regency removed them from the dungeons: upon which they recovered; and ever u since we have had,them remarkably healthy." The dungeons are now totally disused.

It was hardly necessary to inquire if the prisons were inspected by proper officers. The keepers make a report every day to an attentive Lieutenant of the Police: and once in a fortnight the Conseiller de Regence, and the Secretaire and Conseiller des finances visit all the prisons; hear complaints; and inquire if clothes, or any thing necessary be wanting. None of the keepers sell liquor; but prisoners are allowed to send out for a quart of beer a day. They are not permitted to have any spirituous liquors.

In the tower at Cologn, there were no prisoners cither for debt or for capital offences. In this and many other cities, the magistrates will not permit a debtor who has no effects to be confined. — This city has not the power of executing criminals'-, but when they are condemned, they are delivered up to an high officer of the elector's, and confined in a dungeon in his house. I saw one thus confined when I was here six years ago.

In the House of correction, the men were beating stone to powder with small wooden mallets, as is practised at Francfort. The women were spinning, or knitting stockings.

At Wesel, which belongs to the King of Prussia, there were ninety-eight (laves or convicts they have a daily allowance of two pounds of bread, and when they work on the fortifications, or other public works, the value of three halfpence.

The great prison at Aix-la Chapelle was unoccupied.

In the guard prison near the Maison de Ville there were two prisoners; one of whom was a very old man with irons on one hand, who was confined on suspicion, and had twice suffered the torture to force a discovery of his confederates.

Executions are not frequent in this city *. Citizens are always executed by decollation, which is performed by the broad sword, as at Hamburg, Bern, See. and not by a machine, as in some parts of Italy; no; - by the axe, as in England, Denmark, &c.

The two prisons (distinguished by the names of the old and the new) near Ld Porte de St. Leonard in Liege, are on the ramparts. — In two rooms of the old prison I saw six cages made very strong with iron hoops, four of which were empty. (The dimensions were seven feet by six feet nine inches, and six feet and a half high. On one side was an aperture of six inches by four, for giving in the viduals). These were dismal places of confinement, but I soon found worse. In descending deep below ground from the gaoler's apartments, I heard the moans of the miserable wretches in the dark dungeons. The sides and roof were all (tone. In wet weather, water from the foffes gets into them, and has greatly damaged the floors. Each of them had two small apertures, one for admitting air, and another with a shutter over it (Irongly bolted, for putting in food to the prisoners. One dungeon larger

In this and many other cities, the convict knows not of his execution, till three days before the time. Then he is Constantly attended by his confefior, and indulged in the choice of food.

than the rest was appropriated to the tick. In looking into this, with a candle, I discovered a stove, and felt some surprise at this little escape of humanity from the men who constructed these cells.

The dungeons in the new prison are abodes of misery still more shocking; and confinement in them so overpowers human nature, as sometimes irrecoverably to take away the senses. I heard the cries of the distracted as I went down to them. One woman, however, I favv, who (as I was told) had sustained this horrid confinement forty-seven years without becoming distracted.

The cries of the sufferers in the torture-chamber may be heard by passengers without, and guards are placed to prevent them from flopping and listening*. A physician and surgeon always attend when the torture is applied; and on a signal given by a bell the gaoler brings in wine, vinegar and water to prevent the sufferers from expiring. — (( The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel" Thus in the Spanish inquisition, the physician and surgeon attend to determine the utmost extremity of differing without expiring under the torture f.

I will only add that in this prison there are rooms appropriated to prisoners en pension; that is, to such as are confined by the magistrates, at the desire of their parents, guardians or relations. A shocking practice ! which prevails also in some of the neighbouring countries.

In the Maison de Force there were ninety prisoners, ranged in four rooms, and employed in a woollen manufactory of linings for soldiers clothes. Persons live in the house who well understand the business, and instruct the prisoners in sorting, carding, spinning, twisting and weaving. None of them were in irons. All had separate beds, and were supplied with good rye bread, meat three times a week, two quarts of beer for each, every day, and soup every other day.

The chaplain, who lived in the house, favoured me with his company through the work-rooms, lodging-rooms, and the refectory. He entered into the true spirit of this institution, and lamented the inconvenience of the house, as not being built for the purpose to which it is applied. He took notice of the propriety of solitary confinement for those that were riotous and refractory at their first coming; for generally, he said, " in four or five days they would become very tradable and fub-missive."

The author of the Hfiory of the Inquisition at Goa tells us, cap.^23:* In the months of November and December, I heard every day in the morning the cries and groans of those who were put to the Question, which is so very cruel, that I have seen several of both sexes who have been ever after lame. In this tribunal they regard neither age nor sex, nor condition of persons, but all without distinction are tortured, when 'tis for the interest of this tribunal."

AUSTRIAN FLANDERS.

In the Austrian Netherlands I found the prisons in general clean; and no sick ness prevailing in any one of them: and yet few of the prisons have a court: in most of them every prisoner is confined to his room. In some places, as at Antwerp, &c. the allowance to criminals is scanty; a pound and a half of bread a day, and a pound of butter a week: but the deficiency is fully made up by supplies from the monasteries, &c. Debtors very few: they are alimented by their creditors.

In the prison at Antwerp there are two rooms for citizens; and up stairs there is a cage, about six feet and a half square, into which criminals are put before the torture. A criminal, while he differs the torture, is clothed in a long shirt, has his eyes bound, and a physician and surgeon attend him: and when a confession is forced from him, and wine has been given him, he is required to sign his confession; and about forty-eight hours afterwards he is executed.

In a small dungeon is a done feat like some I have seen in old prison towers, in which it is said that formerly prisoners were suffocated by brimstone, when their families wished to avoid the disgrace of a public execution. No person here remembers an indance of this kind; but about thirty years ago there was a private execution in the prison. In this prison in 1778 there were only two prisoners. — In November 1781 there were three prisoners for debt; their allowance was three halfpence a day.

The Clergy have a Prison in this city, which is an pld tower, three dories high, to which persons who come under their cognisance for adultery, ineed, «&c. are committed.

June 15, 17S3, there was not one prisoner in this city.

In 1778 here was a House of correction. The river ran under it-, on one side were the keeper's apartments; on the other, the warehouse and the room for the magistrates *. On three fades of a paved court there were thirteen cells for the men, and over them were the rooms for the women. On one side of the court were the young women who were put in by their parents or relations; and on the other, the criminals. All the men were employed in spinning cotton; so were some of the women, and the red in making lace. A pound of cotton at a time was delivered to

In foreign houses of correction there is a room appropriated to the use of the regents or magistrates, that they may the more conveniently inspect and transact the affairs of the house.

each; for spinning which, thirteen foils*were paid. I found, by the books, that at first coming, some did not earn more than seven or eight sous in a week, but soon after they earned from twelve to fourteen. Rye bread (to the value of half a fiver each meal) and water, was their allowance; and whatever they had more than this, they were required to pay for out of their earnings. They were obliged to put on clean linen every week, towards washing which each paid a sou. The stoves were heated twice a day, and candles and lamps were provided, at the expence of the magistrates.

There were three rooms for the ungovernable. One of them (the penitentiary room) had a floor made of pieces of wood laid edgeways four inches asunder. The prisoner was chained in the middle of this floor, so that he could move but a few steps; and being allowed no shoes or {lockings, whether he flood or laydown, he must have been in a very uneasy posture. This room therefore was dreaded by the prisoners. The other rooms were abodes so dark and solitary, as to be almost equally dreadful.

The men were never suffered to go out, except on Sundays and other holydays, when they went to the chapel, in which they had feats below. The women fat in a gallery, with a lattice of wood before them. Here, and also in the prison, a table of regulations was hung up, which was read in public by the chaplain, the first Sunday after the entrance of every prisoner. — These regulations consisted of thirty-flx articles, from which I have taken the following extracts.

<c The prisoners must be submissive to the keeper and to his wife; and if they think themselves injured, must complain to the regents. — The times fixed for rising are, at half after six in the morning from December ift to February 15th, and all the rest of the year at five, or half after five; but on Sundays and holydays at fix. — The times of meals aFe fixed at seven, twelve, and seven. The prisoners are allowed, at their own expence, at breakfast a pint of tea; and at dinner soup or broth, or a pint of tea or final! beer, and at supper the same quantity of tea or beer; and on Sundays and other holydays a certain quantity of boiled meat: and every week a pound of butter, and fruit to the value of half a stiver. — Every day the keeper is obliged to prepare two forts of soup or broth, and at seven in the morning to give the prisoners their choice of either fort, or none. — After service on Sundays, the men are permitted to walk in the court, and the women in the gallery half an hour, under the inspection of the keeper and officers. — They forfeit half a stiver, every time they curse or swear, or make a disturbance in the chapel; and also every time they are not up in half an hour after they are awakened by the keeper, and for every hour they sleep longer. — If they persist in insulting the keeper or his wife; after admonition, they pay a stiver, and are also punished by having their doors or windows fast closed up.-- If they make any noise or disturbance after nine at night

to break the rejl of their fellow-prisoners, they are ordered to forfeit a schelling and to be punished at the discretion of the regents: who are likewise empowered to make such alterations as they think proper in the rules: and in case of sickness or old age, to give indulgences to the prisoners, with respect to their diet,- times of riling, &c." — In November 1781 the regulations-Rill hung up in the chapel, though the prisoners were removed to Vilvorde.

The Hospital of St. Elizabeth has a lofty ward for each sex; yet, as the upper windows do not open, these wards are offensive. The beams and joists are not plaflered. The beds have no teliers; as all have (improperly) in the infirmaries in Holland.

In the Orphan-house the bed-rooms were large, and had opposite windows. The beds were laid on boards highly varnished, on iron bedsteads (five feet eleven inches by three feet (even) and placed in the middle of the rooms that the windows may be kept open. The bed-rooms and refectories were quite clean.

At Mechlin, one of the belt rooms in the Prison is {ox debtors: but none in it. In 1778 there were three criminals up (lairs, and in 1781, five: no dungeons. Allowance, two threepenny loaves *f and a pound of butter weekly: on Sunday a pound of meat, and some soup: three pints of small beer daily. Straw, and two blankets. Firing from the id of November to the id of May. Clean linen every week from a charity. The mode of torture I will not describe; it has not been used of late years.

At Brussels, in 1778, there were twenty-four felons in the Prison Ld Porte de Halle, in twenty-four chambers (seven feet and a half by seven), distinguished by the letters of the alphabet. Each prisoner had a separate room: daily allowance, two pounds of bread (pain d'ammunition) and some soup: on Sunday* except in Lent, a pound of meat. A keeper of the house of correction was committed to this gaol for abuse of his trust. There were forty-nine prisoners, June 17, 1783. In some large rooms there were five or six men, and in £>ne room at the top of the house ten women (vagrants). Here is no court-yard. The torture is not abolished: the gaoler told me he had seen a man differing on the torture-Jlool for forty-eight hours.

Debtors are sent to another Prison (Treurenbergh); the creditor is obliged to advance a month's aliment. In 1778 I saw there an Englishmen, who had his wife and two or three children with him; but they were not permitted to (lay at night.

Over these are six rooms a little bigger for women. June 17, 1783, there were here no prisoners.

At the gate D'Anderlecht there is a Prison for petty offenders, who are committed for one or two, to six weeks. Their allowance one fou or a penny a day.

The Hospital of St. Jean for the sick is under the care of the Religieuse of S. Augujlin. The wards were close; and at night, as the surgeon said, " offensive beyond description."

In the House of correction in 1778, the prisoners were all employed; and had then a careful and attentive keeper. Some tailors and shoe-makers were at work; but most of the men were occupied in the manufacture of paper-hangings; carving the moulds, grinding the colours, and staining the paper. The women prisoners were entirely separated from the men, and were employed in making hce. In December 1781, this house was empty, for the prisoners were removed to Vilvorde, where their apartments are not so airy and convenient.

The Hospitals of St. Jaqnes and St. Guilliaume, for the maintenance of poor travellers for three days, have been shut these three years; yet the beds still continue in the two rooms of the latter*.

The House of correction which was building in 1778, near Vilvorde, for the provinces of Austrian Brabant, is upon as large a scale as any structure of the kind that I have seen. It is situated near the great canal leading to Brussels; and is almost surrounded by water. The ground plot is rectangular, except a sweep before the court of the governor's house. The longer sides are about two hundred and ten yards; the shorter, about one hundred and sixty-seven. At the back of one of the longer sides, fronting the west, I counted eighty windows on a floor, each two feet by one. There are the same number opposite, looking inwards towards the courts. Each of these belongs to a separate room or cell, near six feet and a half by five and a half, and eight feet high; and a long eight feet and a half wide runs through each floor, into which all the opposite rooms open. Two floors of this side were finished, making three hundred and twenty rooms; there were two more unfinished, of the same nCimber of rooms. Each of the two shorter sides has one hundred and seventy-six rooms, of the same size as the others, and on as many floors. Part of these sides were finished; so that, including some rooms on each side of the governor's house, about five hundred were ready of the nine hundred and

On each Tide the gate of the court before the governor's house, is a porter's lodge.

Prisoners pass this way to their respective wards behind the house. Those committed for life are quite separate from those who are for a limited term: and men totally so from women; not only in their wards, work-rooms, and refectories; but also in two distinct chapels. These chapels are odagons of about thirty-five feet , and on each floor the prisoners have a room looking into them. The work-rooms are numerous; about forty feet by twenty: some up stairs; others under ground for weaving fine linen: but no prisoners sleep under ground. Staircases all fione, six feet wide: some dark cells for confining the refractory. A kitchen forty-seven feet by thirty-four: bake-house, and Jlaugh ter-house large in proportion, and commodious. Convenient apartments for several chaplains: and proper rooms for a military guard. Two spacious infirmaries are designed.

In December 1781 there were in this new House of correction a hundred and sixty-eight men and eighty-six women, clothed in an uniform of light-coloured cloth. They are divided into three classes; and the class to which each of them belongs, together with the number that distinguishes his room, is marked in red, on his clothes and linen. The principal employment of both sexes was spinning cotton , but some of the men were weaving, others making clothes, or shoes; and some of the women were spinning flax, others mending the linen, or making lace. — Most of the floors are of a bad plaster, and cannot be washed. — There are separate work-rooms and refectories to each class, which I found offensive, the windows being all lhut though the weather was calm and fine. But the passages, into which all the bed-rooms open, were mud* more offensive. When I first saw this house, I conjectured this would be the case, and though I took the plan, I did not choose to publish it.

While I was there a prisoner was brought in He was immediately shaved — examined by the surgeon — washed — clothed in the uniform — and then conducted to his class.

There is a room for the magistrates, but on account of its distance from Brussels they too seldom attend. The countenances of the prisoners evidently bespoke inattention and neglect.

The regulations for this house were published at Brussels Feb. 11, 1779, in two edicts *, the first for the direction of the governors, in French and Low Dutch; the other for the discipline of the house, in French, containing sixty articles, which are well worthy of attention, in any country where similar houses are eroded.

In the city of Alost is the gaol for the territory, which includes a hundred and Alost.' thirty-seven villages. There were in this gaol, December 2, 1781, seven prisoners.

Three were confined in a dark room, one, in another room (till more horrid, and the remaining three in a strong cage; notwithstanding which, two of these three were loaded with irons. They are never permitted to go outone, said he had been confined fourteen months, and another, seven. Their victuals are given in at a small aperture at the bottom of the door. Their pale sickly countenances bespoke inhumanity and misery. — June 18, 1783, there were four men and one woman.

At Ghent, in the prison called De Mamelocker*, near the superb Maison de Ville, each criminal had from the city about four pence halfpenny a day: and provision being the re about one third cheaper than in London, some of them saved a little out of that allowance after paying for the weekly washing of their linen. — In 1781, I found that their allowance was not in money but in provisions. — June 17, 1783, here were five debtors, and thirty-four criminals. This prison is made very offensive by the fevvers. — The torture is not abolished; lately, a man fat twenty-four hours on the edged Jlool.

in a Prison, governed by the magistrates for the States, criminals had four pence a day. In each of the prisons the keeper had from the magistrates two pence a day for the custody of every prisoner. In the two prisons in 1778 were four debtors, but now this prison is discontinued, and the prisoners are sent to the Mamelocker.

In the Bishop's prison, at the back of his palace, there are several cages which open into small offensive rooms. In June 1783, there were three prisoners.

Here is a Prison belonging to the rich monastery of Benedictines in the abbey of Sr. Peter. There were thirty-three friars in the house. This fraternity has many lordships, and part of the city in their jurisdiction. The prison joins to the abbot's court-house. Three dreary dungeons down nineteen steps: a little window in each: no prisoners. I went down in 1778; but my noting the dimensions of the windows Pcc. so enraged the keeper, that he would not indulge my curiosity any farther. — May 30, 1783, I found one debtor; and was informed that there were three prisoners in the dungeons.

The House of correction for the city of Ghent is not so commodiously built, nor kept so clean as some other Flemish prisons: but there are very good rules of ^economy, of which I have a copy. Every prisoner is examined at his first coming; and if he be not healthy, he is not put among those that are so. That the keeper may not be tempted to oppress his prisoners, he is exempted from all taxes. The prisoners have a set talk of different forts of work: the profits of extra-zvork their own. The magistrates meet in the prison once a week to inspect it; and to appoint the fort and quantity of provision for every day of the week ensuing. They order the physician to see that the sick have broth, and other nourishment proper for them.

The name is derived from the sculpture over the gate, representing a prisoner nourished by the breast «f his daughter, as related in the Roman history.

The keeper provides it, and is paid by the magistrates. I happened to go into the Ghent, prison while they were there, and saw them employed as above.

I shall beg leave here, on account of the humanity of its institution, to digress from my subject by taking notice of a nunnery in this place. The hospitable mansion is not inhabited solely by nuns; here is a foundation for the reception of twelve men who are insane, and sick aged women; the insane have, when requisite, assistance from their own sex; and the tenderness with which both these and the poor women are treated by the filiers, gave me no little pleasure.

In the Hospital in this city, there are two halls; that for men (one hundred and eighty feet by fifty-three) is vaulted, and lofty as a church.

There is at Ghent a new prison building by the Hates of Austrian Flanders. It is a La house of correction for those provinces (as that at Vilvorde for Austrian Brabant) and is M^I£SON called La Maijon de Force. It is situated near a canal. The plan is an octagon*: only Force. four sides finished: in one of them were, in 1775, one hundred and fifty-nine men criminals: in 1776, one hundred and ninety-one. Another of the sides is for women, of whom there were fifty-nine. In the middle of this court is a bason of water, for washing die linen of the house.

On each of the four floors there is a corridor, or areade, six feet nine inches wide, quite open to the air of the court; which, however, is not attended with any inconvenience, even in winter. In the recess of every corridor, except the lowest, is a range of bed-rooms, six feet ten inches by five feet four, and seven feet eight inches high: the door-way two feet. These are uniformly furnished with a bedstead (six feet and a half by two and a half), a draw bed, a mattress, a pillow, a pair of sheets, two blankets in winter, and one in summer. Each room has a little bench, and a shutter to the lattice window (nineteen inches by fifteen, in the door) which, when opened and turned down, serves for a table. In the wall is a little cupboard, two feet by one, and ten inches deep. All the rooms are vaulted, to prevent fire from running from story to story. — No person is on any pretence admitted into the bed-room of another. They have a clean lhirt once a week, and clean sheets once a month. The women have not separate rooms. Some of theirs are ten feet and a half by nine and a half.

In order to the admission of a prisoner, previous notice must be given by the city or province that fends him. When he comes, he is lhaved and wallied: a surgeon examines him; and if healthy, he is clothed with the uniform of the house, viz. a linen coat and breeches, and cloth waistcoat, which are marked with the number of his room; to it he is conduced by one of the most orderly of the prisoners; who is appointed to that service, and who also acquaints him with the rules of the house. Commitment from one year to twenty or more, according to their crimes.

The plate in Count Viiaini book appeared to me worth copying.

A bell is rung in the morning to summon the prisoners into the dining-room; in the summer at five; in winter the hour varies with the length of the days. Half an hour after the bell rings, their names are called over; and they go to prayers in a chapel. They are then allowed half an hour to breakfast. At noon they have two hours, for dinner, making their beds (which in fair weather they bring out to air) and for recreation. I'was present during the whole time the men criminals were at dinner, and much admired the regularity, decency, and order, with which the whole was conducted. Every thing was done at a word given by a director; no noise or confusion appeared; and this company of near one hundred and ninety flout criminals was governed with as much apparent ease, as the most sober and well-disposed assembly in civil society. At night they have an hour for supper, &c. The bell gives notice of all these successive hours: it is rung at a window over the gate-way by a centinel, who there overlooks the whole court; and, should there be any disturbance, is to give the alarm to a company who keep guard. — There are eight small rooms (cachots) without beds, for the punishment of the refractory; but I always found them empty.

On the ground-floors of the building are work-rooms. Those for the men are too small for the looms, &c. The women's work-room is one hundred and seventy feet long, twenty-six wide, and nine to the springing of the arch. In this, many were spinning and combing wool, mending linen, &c. Others were washing the linen in places proper for that purpose.

An exact account is kept of every circumstance relating to each man's work, in a book that has fourteen columns.

pease, &c. with wheaten bread in it; and, except Friday and Lent, half a pound of cold meat. Each prisoner has also the value of our farthing, for which he can buy near two pints of small beer , or somewhat else which the victualler of that prison is allowed to sell, and deliver to them at a wicket in the wall. Spirituous liquors are expressly prohibited: and so is wine, unless it be ordered by a note from the physician. It is not allowed to give any thing directly to the prisoners: but there is a box into which money may be put; and at stated times it is equally distributed among them. Cards, dice, and all gaming are fcrictly forbidden: and there are excellent rules for preventing all quarreling; mending their morals; preserving their health; and making them for the future useful in society. To transcribe all the rules would to most readers be disagreeable. Such as wish to see them will find them, together with more particulars of this noble institution, in two edicts printed in folio at Ghent in 1773 and 1775; both in French and Low Dutch: and in a book in quarto written by Count Vi'lain XIV. and offered to the government in 1775. The title of it is Memoire fur les Moyens de corriger les Malfaiteurs et Faineans a leur propre Avantage et de les rendre Utiles a l'Etat.

I said transcribing all the rules at length, would be tedious; for this reason I have only given extracts from these, and from those made for other foreign prisons. I have complete copies of them, and of others which I have not mentioned; some printed, others manuscript, which I will readily shew to any gentleman who has leisure and inclination to study the subject.

I revisited this prison in 1778 with-one of the magistrates, and found that they were still carrying on a well-regulated manufactory. There were two hundred and eighty men prisoners, and one hundred and seventeen women. These latter had on the house clothes, and were at work. Most of them were spinning or knitting, ranged in proper order, attentive and quiet. I was informed that all the prisoners were allowed one fifth of their earnings for themselves. I brought home specimens of the cloth, as I did of the paper from Uruffels which I mention, because I know an idea has prevailed, that no manufacture can be carried on by convicts to any valuable purpose.

I have been very particular in my accounts of foreign houses of correctiony especially those of the freed: Hates, to counteract a notion prevailing among us, that compelling prisoners to work, especially in public, was inconsistent with the principles of English liberty; at the same time that taking away the lives of such numbers, either by executions, or the diseases of our prisons, seems to make little impression upon us. Of such force is custom and prejudice, in silencing the voice of good sense and humanity

The number of criminals in December 1781, was two hundred and six. They were spinning — weaving — making nets — making and mending clothes — or working in the bake-house and kitchen; and appeared clean and healthy. The doors of the

bed-rooms were open while they were out in the day-time, and none of the rooms were in the least offensive. — In another quarter, the number of petty offenders was a hundred and six, who were employed in the same manner with the criminals above-mentioned; except some who worked as carpenters, turners, and smiths, for the use of the house. — On the women's side there were a hundred and fifty, who were washing — spinning — making and mending the linen — or at work in the kitchen. Their bread, soup and meat were good and plentiful, and all bespoke the care and attention of the director. A list of such prisoners as behave well is annually sent to the Emperor (about Good Friday): in 1782 twelve received their pardon. — If, however, I venture to point out some defeats in so good an institution, that others may avoid them, I hope to be excused. — The building has too many stories — the rooms and corridors are too low — the infirmaries are not sufficiently detached — there are not proper workrooms, and those are some steps under ground — the women have not separate dormitories — the sewers are improperly placed — the distribution of provisions, being but once a day, is not frequent enough — and the bowls, being of wood, cannot easily be kept clean.

The two work-rooms that were lately erected, were much more crowded than those at Vilvorde, and yet they were not like them, offensive. This surprised me at first, till I considered that the difference was owing, probably, to the clothes of the prisoners at Vilvorde being of wool, and the particular offensiveness of the bed-rooms there.

At my visit in 1783, I found here a great alteration for the worse3 the flourishing and useful manufactory destroyed; and the looms and utensils all sold, in consequence of the Emperor's too hasty attention to a petition from a few interested persons. — That which ought to be the leading view in all such houses is now lost in this house. — Many formerly ascribed the comfort and happiness of their lives to the trades they here learned, and the attention here paid them , but now, the men and women (the former three hundred and twenty-six in number and the latter a hundred and fifty)' do not earn, one with another, seven farthings a day. Their victuals are also reduced; the meat from half a pound to six ounces, and greens from three to two farthings-worth a day. Their bread, made in the house, is now ammunition bread. — In consequence of this vile policy I found the alpect of the prisoners quite changed; nor could I wonder to hear that a quarter of the house is soon to be fitted up for an infirmary.

[Bruges.]

At Bruges there is to the Prison a court-yard for criminals, and another for debtors: but the former are never let out. Each fort has a daily allowance in money, about three pence halfpenny English; provisions rather cheaper than in London: a clean shirt every week. Debtors have the allowance from their creditors \ who also pay the keeper a small fee at the entrance of the prisoner, and a penny a day during his confinement. No dungeons. Two things are remarkable in this prison, and well worth imitating. One is, the care they take of the sick. There are two medical books,

AUSTRIAN FLANDERS. 149

one for the city, the other for the seigneuries or lordships, which are governed by different magistrates, but the prison is common to both." The physician at every visit enters his prescription in the respective book, which is carried to the apothecary; who, after copying the recipe, fends the book. back again; and it is kept in the room where the magistrates meet to hold a court of judicature, inspect the prison, &c. I spent some hours in looking over them. The prescriptions are written with regularity for many years past. Bark and cordials were almost constant ingredients in the recipe. They are not troubled with infectious distempers; but perhaps the physicians are somewhat apprehensive of them, and order those preventives with success. The physician orders a surgeon to attend them when the case requires one: and at his order also the keeper provides for the sick, Joup, white bread, &c. the magistrates allowing for this fourteen pence a day, to continue till countermanded by the physician. Some sick prisoners have been many weeks thus liberally provided for.

The other exemplary practice is, their care of legacies and donations. In the council-chamber, under a picture representing visiting the sick, feeding the hungry, and releasing the prisoner, there is in a frame a printed list of all charities given or bequeathed to the prisoners from the year 1315 to 1734; with the names and intentions of the several donors: and in another small frame is a memorial of the time at which each, bequest is to be distributed.

In December 1781, here were three debtors and sixteen criminals.

In the Raftp-house, Dec. 1781, there were fifty-eight men who were spinning and weaving. Each has his dormitory over the work-rooms. The rooms of the turnkeys adjoining, are furnished with alarm-bells. One of the prisoners had been confined thirty-four years, for an attempt to set fire to this house; since which the ceilings have been arched with brick between the joists. — This house is under the care of four friars and four sisters. — I asked one of the friars, how much the prisoners earned ? He answered, fGme, seven pence a day, but, one with another, no more than two pence.

The Hospital in this city is a very spacious and airy room, with a wainfeot partition or fereen which divides the men from the women. — The great attention of the nuns distinguishes the hospitals in Roman catholic countries. Their recluse life gives them a pale look, and is the reason, probably, why the wards of the patients are kept too dole; here however they look very healthy. There are twenty of them, who rife at four, and are constantly employed about their numerous patients. The directrefs of the pharmacy last year celebrated her jubilee or fiftieth year of residence.

These sisters asked, whether I was a catholic ? I answered, "I love good people of all religions." Then, said they, tc we hope you will die a catholic."

The prison at Ostend, which is near the town-house, consists of nine rooms, but no court. May 27, 17 81, there were in it four debtors and seven criminals; and June 21, 1783, two debtors and four criminals. Eight pence a day is paid to the gaoler for each criminal and insolvent debtor, for which they have one pound and a half of bread, and an allowance of meat except on meagre days. The gaoler is allowed two pence a day for each, and fifteen pence at entrance, and discharge. The chaplain officiates on Sundays and holydaysj he, and the surgeon are paid by the city.

PORTUGAL.

Imprisonment for debt is prohibited in Portugal by an ordinance made in

1774. There is an entire separation of the sexes in prisons and infirmaries. No garnish is taken in prisons but I found the bad custom prevalent here of detaining prisoners for the gaoler's fees: those fees are often paid by a charitable society called the Misericordia. Many from the first families in the kingdom are of this order. They fend provisions twice a week to several prisons; and, like the Confraternita della misericordia at Rome, pay great attention to capital convicts. Criminals here are often kept in confinement for several-years before they are brought to trial; and sometimes, even after being tried and condemned, they lie in prison some years before they are executed *. I saw some convicts at Lisbon going from prison to embark for the fetrlements in, the Brafils. Such convicts as are designed for India are enrolled as soldiers, and sent to a house (or hospital) on the other side of the river, where they are kept some weeks, to bathe, and to be better clothed and fedy that they may be properly prepared for their long voyage.

The great Prison at Lisbon, Limoiero, (formerly a palace) is designed for the reception of prisoners from the provinces as well as from the city. There were seven hundred and seventy-four, on Feb. 21, 1783. In one of the lower wards there were seventy criminals, but none in irons. On the first floor there were many who paid for better accommodations, and received no donations from the misericordia. Here

Before the Marquis of PomlaVs administration, gaolers used often to let their prisoners out on their farolt. One thus favoured, was ordered for execution seven years after he had been condemned. On the gaoler's summons, he immediately returned to the prison from his work in the country. For this punctual regard to his promise he received a pardon.

Sect. IV. PORTUGAL.

civil and criminal causes are tried in a large hall called Caza da Supplica^am3 which the Lisbon prisoners use for a day-room and lodging-room: the courts of justice are opened at Pr1sons eight or nine in the morning. There are two infirmaries, one for each sex: in that for men there were eighteen persons, in single beds with proper bedding: their room looked towards the river, and was spacious, clean and airy. In the room for the condemned, the beds were in recefies. Over these, in a large gallery latticed, there were beds for the sick from the secrete or private chambers. — In this country, and also in Spain, one seldom fees glass windows; but in prisons, never.

In the Prison at the castle, the wards below as well as those in the great prison, are designed for those that cannot pay; and the first floor for those who pay a stipulated sum. Several small rooms open into a common passage, in some of which (the secrete) the prisoners are closely confined. There is no court-yard either to this prison or to that called Limoiero (lemon grove).

The ecclesiastical Prison (Aljube), near the great church, is under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch. It consists of four rooms and a small chapel. Here were confined six priests, and three women. In this and the other prisons, the prisoners may be conversed with through the iron grates: but I always went into the prisons.

In a Prison by the rope-walk near the river, many of the nobles and priests were confined in the time of the marquis of PombaVs administration. Here, nineteen vaulted rooms open into a passage: I measured some of them, they were about twenty feet by nine. The wall was six feet two inches thick. In the entrance to each room there were three doors; the middle one was an iron grate with round bars. Over each of the doors there was an aperture to admit light, except in two rooms called secrete3 which were totally dark*.

The Prison at Bellem (about two miles from Lisbon) has four rooms below, and Bellem several on the first floor for those who pay. Criminals less atrocious than those sent to P&IS0M* Limoiero are here confined. The prisoners subsist by charitable donations; and the gaoler told me, that he had a right to a fee from every one discharged.

In the Arsenal are four large rooms for the (laves or convicts, most of whom are Lisbon Moors. Some work at the rope-walk, others fetch water, a few are closely confined, Arsenal and three or four chained to one spot; one of whom (an Italian) told me he had been thus confined eight years; another, four years. The rest were chained two and two together, and those that went but had a long chain between them, which was taken off as soon as they returned into the arsenal. Their allowance from government was one pound of biscuit a day, and some rice, and half a pound of meat three

When the prison of the inquisition was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1755, a few persons saw the rooms of confinement. One gentleman told me, that they open into a long passage, like those at the prison. by the rope-walk, but were smaller and under ground.

Castle. A manufactory was begun in the Castle about two years ago, for the employment of vagrant and deserted children, in carding, spinning, weaving, making lace, embroidery, &c. About a thousand children were thus employed here. Such an institution may be a great advantage in a country like this, where young people are very much addicted to idleness. But would it not be better, if greater numbers of them, were employed in the arts which are most useful and necessary

Hospitals. The General hospital of S. Joze, (formerly the Jesuits college) has fifteen wards for men and six for women. The number of the former was five hundred and ninety-three; of the latter, two hundred and eighty. Some of the wards were spacious (forty-six feet wide), and had only two rows of beds, in recejfes. These recedes open into a private passage two feet nine inches wide. — The lower wards, particularly those for the insane, are too close.

The Military hospital of S. Joao de Deos (in which were one hundred and seventy-one ^patients) was formerly a convent, and not used for an hospital till since the earthquake of 1755. Here are (twelve) wards for different disorders, but most of them I thought too close.

The English hospital for merchants' seamen, (adjoining to their burying-ground) consists of two or three rooms, in which at my fird visit March 3, 1783, were seven patients. The rooms were clean, the victuals good. This hospital has six visitors} each of whom attends two months. The names of the visitors and their months of attendance for this year, I saw hung up in the dudy of our worthy consul Sir John Hort, by whom this beneficial mode of inspection was fird proposed.

The English marine hospital is on the southern side of the Tagus, which is here about two miles over. The hospital has two wards on the ground-floor, in which I found no patients: eight or ten Danish sailors had. lately died here of a malignant fever. In the upper ward were fourteen Englishmen, each of whom had a bed. The side-wall was damp, the ground being ten feet high against it, and all the rooms were very dirty. — This hospital is rented. — On many accounts, it should be on the Lisbon side of the river, where every advantage of situation might be chosen. Gentlemen would then undertake the inspection of it; the head surgeon might daily attend; and our seamen here would not be so liable as they are, to be decoyed into foreign service.

"In this country the prisoners have a dispensation to eat meat the two first days of Lent (viz. Ash Wednesday and Thursday) so that families may send in to them, the remains of their flesh provisions.

In the Misericordia hospital for foundlings, there were between eighty and ninety chil. dren, most of them Moors. They looked healthy and clean. Each nurse had four infants under her care. There is a cradle on the outside which turns on an axis, with a bell to give notice. — Bastardy in this country is attended with little disgrace, children not born in wedlock being allowed to inherit; and this, perhaps, may be the reason why the number of foundlings in this hospital is so inconsiderable*.

The prisoners at Evora and Elvas subsist by charity. Some of them had been Evora. confined three, four, or five years, without being brought to trial f.

The Hospital at Evora had a recess for the bed of each patient; these recedes were lined with glazed tiles. The wards in it, as in all the hospitals I saw in this country, were much too close.

Some of the prisons which I visited, had a passage to the street and to the lodging-rooms, secured on both sides by iron grates, at which most of the prisoners were begging.

SPAIN.

[Spain.]

I entered Spain at Badajoz, March 9, 17S3. This country abounds with charitable institutions, and there are at present few or no beggars in it. Most of the prisons have courts for men, with fountains or running water in the centre, and corridors for shade. The same separation of the sexes which I observed in the Portuguese prisons, takes place here; and it is the custom likewise, as in Portugal, for the gaolers to demand fees of prisoners before they are discharged. A condemned criminal, after the judges have made their report, is seldom pardoned by the king. After condemnation,

he is called from the other prisoners into the chapel, where his sentence is read to him by a secretary, and a friar attends to exhort and comfort him, who never leaves him till he is executed. The sentence is generally read on Saturday, and the execution ordered for the Monday following.

When a confession is extorted from a criminal by torture, it is read to him twenty-four hours afterwards, that he may either confirm or retradl it. But in some of the provinces this shocking practice does not take place.

It is the custom at Madrid for two of the privy council to visit the prisons; and they often either reverse or alter the sentences of the inferior judges. When I was there, the sentence of one condemned to the Prado prison for eight years, was altered to four months; another sentenced to the same prison for six months, on account of his large family was discharged.

Some of the churches in Spain are asylums for debtors and criminals. At Madrid there are only two, S. Sebastian for men, and S. Luis for women. At the former, there were five persons; one of whom said he had been there two years. At the latter, there was only one. A pavement round these churches, about three feet wide, is the verge of the privilege*.

I found more attention paid to prisoners, and the prisons kept cleaner, in the capitals of Portugal and Spain, than in the provinces.

At Badajoz most of the prisoners in one of the prisons looked unhealthy, and were deserters and smugglers. Their allowance of bread was a pound and a half per day. There is a Military hospital belonging to this prison, to which the sick are removed, and in which I saw eleven patients. The entrance to this hospital is by a courtj and most of the wards open to an interior court like other Moorish. buildings.

There is another prison at Badajoz. The prisoners were begging at the grates; for they subsist partly by alms, and partly by selling purses, &c. which they make in the prison.

At TALAVERA there were three Hospitals. In the largest (Cannon's) the two wards were spacious and airy. That for men had eight iron bedsteads, and the other fix. Adjoining to the men's ward, there was a neat room and bed for sick decayed ecclesiastics.

* Dr. Moore, in his View of Society and Manners in Italy, judiciously observes, that "the asylum which churches and convents offer to criminals, operates against the peace of society, and tends to the encouragement of this shocking custom (stabbing) in two different manners: first, it increases the criminal's hopes of escaping; secondly, it diminishes, in vulgar minds, the idea of the atrocity of the crime. When the populace see a murderer lodged within the sacred walls of a church, protected and fed by men who are revered on account of their profession, and the supposed sanctity of their lives; must not this weaken the horror which mankind naturally have for such a crime, and which it ought to be the aim of every government to augment?" Letter XLIII.

At Toledo there are two Prisons. In one of these there were only eight prisoners. But in the other, which was the principal prison, there were, March 16, 1783, two hundred and twenty prisoners; most of whom lay under the corridors in a small court: many were loaded with irons, and almost: all looked unhealthy. In the two Fick rooms on the first floor, several miserable objects were dying in their beds. On my observing to the gaoler, that the prison was crowded, he informed me, that a fortnight before it had been more crowded, a hundred having been then removed to the arsenal at Carthagena (in Murcia.)

In the Hospital of San Juan de Bios there is only one ward, in which there were six beds, each of them placed in a recess, eight feet by six feet three inches.

The Hospital of San Juan Baptista (founded by one of the archbishops) is finely fimated at a little distance from the city. It has summer and winter wards for each sex, exaflly similar, except that the wards for summer are more airy: the windows opening to the floor. The men's wards are twenty-four feet wide, with two rows of beds in lofty recejfest in each of which is a window for fresh air. The women's wards were clean, the furniture of their beds linen, but not placed, as the beds of the men were, in recesses. Adjoining to the wards there is a spacious corridor for walking.

The principal Prison (La Car cel de Corte) at Madrid, has an elegant front*, with this inscription, Reynando la Majestad de Felipe IV. anno de 1634, con acuerdo del Consejo se fabrico este Cane.I de Corte para comodidady y seguridad de los presos. "In the reign of his majesty Philip IV. A.D. 1634, by direction of the Council, this Court Prison was erected for the convenience and security of prisoners." The number of prisoners, March 22, 1783, was one hundred and forty men and forty women. There are many rooms on the upper floors about fifteen feet by ten, some with stone bedsteads, and iron hooks for chaining the prisoners. In some of the rooms there were three or four prisoners, in others but one. Here are two courts; one of them, in which were most of the prisoners, was paved and had arcades on two sides, and a fountain in the middle j*. Some of the prisoners had irons on both legs, with a strong bolt between. These lay on barracks in dungeons down twenty-two steps. In one of the dungeons the gaoler has beds, which he lets to those who will pay him a real vellon and a half (4d.) a night. The women were in one large room; none of them in irons. In the infirmary, which was a large and clean room, the men lay single, and were not in irons. — The provisions were good; the bread fine, the allowance exactly one pound per day. The gaoler has the liberty of taking some prisoners into his house, each of whom pays twenty-five doubloons for the

term of his confinement. He has rooms also for which six doubloons are paid, besides a real vellon and a half a night for a bed. He can take off the irons of a prisoner, on the payment of two dollars. — The courts are held within the prison. — The whole prison was clean; and the gaoler, as I was informed by one of my countrymen there confined, whom I frequently visited, is humane and attentive to his prisoners, who all looked' healthy.

The City prison (La Carcel de Villa) is like the former, but has only one court-yard. There were in it about one hundred and twenty men and thirty women. The rooms and dungeons were very dirty and offensive; and the walls of one of the torture-rooms was drained with blood. I was sorry to find such traces of this practice among people, in other respects generous and humane.

La Carcel de la Corona is a prison for ecclesiastics. There were in it five priests, one of whom had his wife with him.

At the gate of the poll-office, there are four or five dungeons where vagrants, beggars, &c. are confined for a few days, till they are sent to San Fernando. There were here five men and two women: their allowance was twelve quartils (nearly four pence) a day, besides alms received at the grates from passengers.

The Prado prison, near the public walk of that name, is one long room in which are barrack-bedsteads. Here were upwards of one hundred prisoners: some were chained to the floor, or to the barracks on which they lay; some worked on the roads, bridges. See. Others having been marines, were to be sent to the docks. They are divided into three classes. To those who work on the roads, &c. the allowance is seventeen quartils (five pence); to marines3 fourteen; and to those in irons, who do not work, twelve quartils.

I saw about fifty coming from work, and asked some of them, which they preferred; working, or confinement? They readily replied, the former; but added, that they were not forced to work hard. I observed that the guard, with them and at the prison,

were calm and steady.

San Fernando, about eight miles from the city, is a House of correction for petty offenders, vagrants, and beggars. Here were three hundred and nine men and five hundred and forty-seven women. Some were carrying ftqne to a lime-kiln; some making and walking the linen of the house; and some were spinning linen and worded. The work-rooms are thirty-two feet wide; the infirmaries are spacious, at the top of the house. The prisoners were clothed in an uniform, and each is allowed two pair of shoes and (lockings. The men's apartments were clean, but the women's (as is generally the case in the Spanish prisons and hospitals) were much cleaner. Every one had a bed, a mattress and two coverlets. The women here have a court as well as the men; and both courts are commanded by the keeper's balcony. The provisions were good: the bread allowance is twenty ounces a day. Two of the prisoners attend at dinner, to see that each is served with his full portion of soup (three quarters of a pint). They

are allowed three feasts in a year, Christmas, Easter, and San Fernando's- day. Here is a shop for the sale of wine, the quality and price of which are fixed by the magistrates; but no spirituous liquors are permitted to be sold.. No fees are paid at entrance, or discharge. The prison is attended by a physician, a surgeon and a chaplain: it has also a guard, consisting of thirty foot and eight horse, which is changed every month.

Here is a head-keeper or governor on the men's side, a humane, sensible and attentive man, who resides in the house: as also on the women's side there is a resident governess. The regulations are peculiarly calculated for the preservation of decorum and due subordination; for the prevention of fraud and embezzlement in the distribution of provision and clothing; for enforcing a strict and devout performance of religious duties; for an exact separation of the two sexes; and for the constant and regular employment of every individual in the house. I shall here copy only the Diet: table

M ADM!) HOSPICIO.

Hospitals.

The Hospicio, a sort of prison, is also a well-regulated manufactory, in which the sexes are entirely separated. A considerable number of men, advanced in years, were picking wool. In one room, an hundred and fifty boys were spinning worded; in another, sixty were carding wool. Forty or fifty looms were employed on coarse linen; others on wide cloth. In two rooms I observed flocking and waistcoat frames. Some boys were carding and spinning the down of hares and rabbits for gloves; and some were employed in a pin manufactory. A number of tailors and carpenters I also saw at work. Fifty of the lead boys were under instruction in the school. All commonly rife at fix5 attend prayers, and then go to breakfast 3 dine about noon3 and sup at sun-set. They have twenty-two ounces of bread, and two ounces of pease a day, and half a pound of meat, except on meagre days. There are two rooms for the confinement of the disorderly. — The regulations of this well-conducted house are the same with those for San Fernando.

The Real Hospital General, is a new building round a spacious court (three hundred and ten feet by two hundred) in which are two reservoirs of water. Three sides of the court have corridors, twelve feet wide. The great wards (fifty-five feet and a half wide) divided by a wall having several arches, are furnished with double rows of beds on iron bedsteads (six feet three inches by three feet two) one for each patient, and a marble flab is placed against the wall for every two beds. The rooms are arched over, and have many apertures in the ceiling, but all the windows were shut. At one end of each ward is an altar, at the other a fire-place. The number of men, as appears by a list that was given me, was five hundred and eighty-nine. A multitude of visitors rendered the wards dirty and noisy. The staircases are light and airy 3 the steps are of stone, sixteen inches wide 3 and the afeent (four inches) easy.

The number of women was three hundred and two. Their apartments in the new hospital being not yet built, they were lodged in the old wards, which are much cleaner than the men's. In this hospital, and at one or two in Portugal, convalescents are put into the closest and worst rooms.

Here is a detached ward, for prisoners, furnished with twenty-eight beds, and well guarded. Here are likewise rooms (carefully separated) for insane, for dropsical, and for consumptive patients. The contagion of consumptions is supposed to infect not only the clothes, bedding, and furniture of rooms, but also the walls and ceiling. Danger has been apprehended even from the horses of consumptive patients, and for this reason it was thought necessary, in an instance that was mentioned to me, to kill the horse of an officer who had died of this distemper. — Besides one principal physician, there are eighteen others, who attend their Hated* wards, six surgeons with two hundred pupils (praticantes), and twenty-three priests, besides servants, who all lodge and board in the hospital.

The Hospital of San Juan de Dios is chiefly appropriated to venereal patients. Here hundred and seventy-three men and twenty-eight women. The wards for

the men are up stairs: the women's apartment is on the ground-floor, and has an aperture in it so contrived, as that their friends may converse with them without seeing them. The wards of both sexes were cleaner and quieter than those of the general hospital.

In the convent De la Latina there are two rooms for sick men, one for summer, the other for winter, with beds in recesses.

In the convent (or hospital) of San Francisco, there are two wards, one with seven beds for men, the other with eight for women. At the time of my visit, they were serving the afternoon chocolate. — In the hospitals that are in convents, the rooms are much cleaner and quieter, and more attention is paid to the patients, than in other hospitals. — -Here is a charitable foundation for eight widows, of officers who died in the late war.

There are at Madrid two other Hospitals which may well deserve to be mentioned; one, called the hospital de la Corte; the other, the hospital of San Antonio.

The hospital de la Corte Sox the king's servants, is built in the form of a cross. It. has an altar in the centre, under a cupola. The wards are vaulted and lofty. The walls are lined (five feet high) with glazed tiles. In the walls there are convenient; alcoves (three feet nine inches wide, and five feet and a half high) with linen curtains before them. The beds in this hospital are large and not in recesses. The patients have chocolate and biscuit for breakfast, and also in the afternoon.

The hospital of San Antonio is intended chiefly for the reception and accommodation of poor travelling Austrians, for three days. In one room there are four beds for men; in another, three for women.. Here is also a refectory. The allowance to each traveller is two pounds of bread, one pound of mutton, and a quarter of a pound of lard a day. In the two rooms for the sick, the regulations for the physician, surgeon, and patients, are hung up.

In a room in this hospital a charitable society, called the Hermandad del Refugio, meet every evening, and then go about the streets, giving notice of their presence by striking the pavement with sticks shod with iron. Whatever poor and distressed people they tneet with in this perambulation, they conduct to this hospital, and supply them with a supper of bread and eggs, one night's lodging (in rooms which are appropriated for them), and a breakfast of bread and raiflns* The sick they send to the general hospital, where one of the eighteen physicians already mentioned always attends to examine and admit patients. — In that part of this hospital which is next the street, there is a place into which the sick put notices of their distress, in consequence of which they are immediately visited and relieved by the society.

At Madrid, the fine Spanish bread was two pounds for two pence halfpenny. I always preferred this to the French bread, which was somewhat dearer. — At the entrance of Spain a measure of wheat, which weighs about no lb. cost from twelve to fourteen reals; of barley, from five to six.

Inquisition.

In the city of Valladolid there are four courts, the chancery, the city, the bishop's court, and the inquisition, each of which has a prison belonging to it: but in the bishop's prison, of late, there have been few or no prisoners.

Most of the prisoners in the Chancery or province prison lie on a bench in a long room: it has no dungeons. In the chapel is a stone bedstead for the condemned. April 4, 1783, there were one hundred and twenty-eight men and thirteen women.

In the City prison also most of the prisoners were crowded together into one long room. This prison was not without dungeons. I passed through two, into a dark and damp and dismal one, in which I law a poor creature lying on his back chained by both legs to a great stone. — Prisoners here are confined for a long time before they are brought to trial. — Fees are demanded as at Madrid — The prison allowance is one real. About thirty convicts (preftdios) were to be sent the following week to Ferrol, they are allowed two reals a day. The prisoners are not allowed to shew themselves at the grates of the prison; and the same is true of the two principal prisons at Madrid. — Not long since, one who was put to the torture here, denied the crime -for which he was tortured, but confessed another (a murder) and was executed for it.

I failed in my attempt to gain admittance into the inquisition at Lisbon. At Madrid, by the kind assistance of Count Campomanes, I got access to the inquisitor-general, but the day on which I applied to him being a great holiday, he appointed me seven o'clock the next morning. On this holiday I saw the inquisitor, several of the nobility and others, go in procession to church, carrying the insignia of the order, which are a cross between a palm and a sword. — The next morning, the inquisitor received me at prayers, and in a few minutes conducted me to the tribunal, which was hung with red: over the inquisitor's feat there was a crucifix, and before it a table with feats for the two secretaries, and a stool for the prisoner. I could not prevail on him to shew me any other part of the prison; but he told me that he went round once a month with a secretary, and asked every prisoner whether he had any complaint to make.

The letters of the same kind friend, Count Campomanes, procured my admission at Valladolid. I was received at the inquiftion-prison by the two inquisitors, their secretaries, and two magistrates, and conduced into several rooms. On the side of one room was the picture of an Auto de Fe in 1667, when ninety-seven persons were burnt: at this time the Spanish court resided at Valladolid*. The tribunal room is like that at Madrid, but has an altar, and a door (with three locks) into the secretary's room, over which was inscribed, that die greater excommunication was denounced against all strangers who presume to enter. In two other tribunal rooms, were, the insignia of the inquisition. In a large room, I saw on the floor and

shelves, many prohibited books, some of which were English: in another room, I saw multitudes of erodes, beads, and small pictures. The painted cap was also Chewed me, and the vestments for the unhappy victims. After several consultations, I was permitted to go up the private staircase, by which prisoners are brought to the tribunal; this leads to a passage with several doors in it, which I was not permitted to enter. On one of the secretaries telling me, " none but prisoners ever enter these rooms I answered, I would be confined for a month to satisfy my curiosity; he replied, "none come out under three year, and they take the oath of secrecy." I learned, by walking in the court, and conversing with the inquisitors, that the cells have double doors, and are separated by two walls, to prevent prisoners conversing together, and that over the space between the walls there is a fort of chimney or funnel, enclosed at the top, but having perforations on the sides, through which some air and a glimmering of light enter. These funnels, the inquisitors told me, are double barred: and one of them serves two cells. Both the inquisitors allured me that they did not put irons on any of their prisoners. The passages into which some of the cells open, have small apertures for the admission of light. — In a gloomy area at the back of the prison, there was nothing but a great mastiff dog.

It is well known that from this court there is no appeal. — I need not say how horrid the secrecy and severity of it appear. I could not but observe, that even the fight of it {truck terror into the common people as they passed. It is stiled, by a monstrous abuse of words, the holy and apostolic court of inquisition.

The bell Hospital in this city is the Efgueva: the wards are one hundred and eight feet by thirty, with windows at the ends. Each ward has twenty-eight beds in recesses; and two doors opposite, which open into corridors.

The Prison at Burgos, (built, as appears by an inscription on the front, in 1778) surrounds a court forty feet square, in which is a fountain, and a done trough. The cells are fourteen feet by nine and a half. They have two doors, the inner one latticed. The number of prisoners April 8, 1783, was one hundred and forty-five men and seven women. The women, as in other gaols in this country, are always locked up in then-rooms. In the men's infirmary there were nineteen beds in recesses, but only six patients. The architect has been very attentive to the construction of drains and sewers, for though this gaol was very dirty, it was not offensive. In this, as in other Spanish prisons, there are flocks for the punishment of offences committed within the prison. — No rules and orders are hung up. — Here is no torture-room.

The Hospicio {lands near the river, and consists of a house of correction, an hospital for foundlings, and a chapel. It has two courts, one for men and the other for women, in the former of which there is a water-mill for grinding corn. Two rooms are appropriated to the sick. Four nurses are always present, to take care of the infants that are brought in, till they can be sent to be nursed in the country. The bread is good and made in the house. The allowance to each person one pound and a half.

The disorderly are punished by being confined in a dark room:a woman in one of these rooms requested, with tears, my interposition for her. I applied to the chaplain, who is the superintendent of the house, and he readily consented to release her from her confinement.

The Hospital del Rey at the rich convent of the Volgas, about two miles from the city, has two spacious wards for each sex, that the chirurgical patients may be separated from the others. These wards were very clean, and the beds placed in alcoves (ten feet by nine feet four inches) with curtains before those for the women. The other three hospitals at Burgos referable this noble hospital: and have small botanic gardens belonging to them*.

The Prison at Pamplona is an old building in the middle of the city. It has three small courts: the prisoners lie in boxes without mattresses or bedding. There were flocks, and also a dark vaulted room for the punishment of offences committed in the prison. The rooms being very dirty and offensive, I inquired whether epidemical distempers had not sometimes prevailed there, and was answered in the affirmative, and told that about eight years ago, eighteen or twenty prisoners had died in a short time. Here were sixty-one men and three women April 15, 1783. Allowance to each is about two pence a day.

The upper floor of this prison is used as a House of correction for women. I saw twenty-eight in four rooms, all spinning, but not with wheels. Each had a bed; the rooms were clean. The bread was good; allowance one pound and a half a day. The term of confinement, from four years to eight; but if any person should choose to marry one confined for small offences, the magistrates are ready to release her. One of the magistrates told me that he visited this prison every week, to hear any complaints that might be made. I inquired, whether the keeper went with him ? he replied, that he did.

The torture is not used in this province (Navarre). A singular custom prevails here *, for twice in the year (the day before Christmas, and eight days before Easter), the Viceroy goes with the magistrates to the council-chamber in the prison, and releases whom he pleases of the prisoners. The day before I got to Pamplona, he had released thirteen. A few years ago, to the surprise of the magistrates, all were released.

Two, of the four churches in this city, are Asylums for debtors and criminals, at one of which (the cathedral) there was one criminal.

[Citadel.]

In the Citadel there were one hundred and twenty slaves (or convicts) crowded into five or six rooms, Those in the upper rooms had only a ring on one leg. Those in the lower rooms, about thirty in number, very sickly, were chained two and two with heavy chains, and some for very flight offences. The rooms had

barracks, but no bedding. There is the same allowance to all, one pound and a half of brown bread and about five farthings each in money. A loaf, weighing exactly three pounds, is given to every soldier every other day; but for the prisoners, it is divided, and one half given them everyday, to prevent them from selling it*.-Those

who have only a ring, find securities for not escaping, and sometimes are employed in the houses in the citadel, and paid for their labour. If they escape, their securities are obliged to put on the chain and to take their places. If they are retaken, their term is doubled.

Some for more atrocious crimes are sent to Carthagena, and others to the African settlements.

Here is a large building called the Mifeericordia, similar to the hosepicio in Madrid, in which are confined beggars, vagrants, and refractory children. Workmen also are here employed, and apprentices taken, to carry on a manufactory of coarse cloth.

Near the Mifeericordia there is an Hofepital for Orphan* or children of the poor (los ninos de la doSlrina). They are taught to read and work, and the boys serve in the churches. Their number was forty-five boys and thirteen girls. This house is in part supported by the contributions of those who play at ball, in a building erected by the city for that diversion, which is here a favourite one-f.

At the great Hofepital I found the men's wards very dirty J, but the women's clean. There is a distinct ward for chirurgical patients, and also wards for sick priseoners. I observed, that the same attention was paid to them, as to the other patients, for I twice attended one of the physicians through the wards. All the patients lie

f At Madrid also, a part of the money collected at the play-houfo and at the lullfcajls, is appropriated to the fHpport of the hospitals.

X The floors of most hospitals in Spain, are laid with a soft and bad brick, and they are sometimes sprinkled but never washed. In the men's wards no women attend. What renders the wards in general so close and

0 Fen five as many are, is the practice of continually taking snuff and spitting; together with an universal prejudice which prevails-in this country, (though so hot a climate), against the free admission of air, and washing of rooms. The custom of washing the feet and hands of patients before they are put to bed, which

1 have observed in some hospitals, is not known here. — I am persuacted, however, that such a custom, with air and cleanliness, and an abstemious diet, are of more necessary importance in hospitals than any administration of physick.

Angle; and this salutary practice is general in the Spanish hospitals. Near the women's ward, nine or ten infants lay bound hands and feet in a smoky kitchen. In a spacious room just by, the governess lodged. On my mentioning to the physician before her, that the infants should be in that room and not in the kitchen; (he said it was too cold for them. I replied, the true reason was, that (he thought they would disturb her rest.

Before I take my leave of Spain, I must make my most grateful acknowledgments of the kind assistance given me in my tour through it by Sir John Hort, Count Fernan-Nunez the Spanish ambassador at Lisbon, and Count Campomdnes at Madrid.

FRENCH FLANDERS and FRANCE.

The French provinces in Flanders and the Netherlands, are chiefly governed by the same arret de parlement as the provinces in France.

The Tour de St. Pierre at Lille is an old building. There were in it. May 24, 1783, three debtors, five smugglers and four vagrants. Five were sick in a very offensive room, with only one bed. Allowance is one pound and a half of bread. The small and dark dungeons down fifteen steps, I was glad to find unoccupied.

I have reason to be abundantly thankful for recovery from a fever which I caught of the sick, in this prison, at my last visit; and would make my grateful acknowledgment to that kind hand, by which I have been hitherto preserved.

At the City prison there were fourteen prisoners: their allowance consists of bread, butter, and small beer. The dungeons were empty.

The unhealthy countenances of the prisoners at the Citadel shew the pernicious effects of lying in caserns, or damp rooms under the fortifications. May 26, 1783, here were three hundred and forty prisoners, most of them deserters. In the sick-rooms, which were very close and dirty, there were eighty-six; some of whom, though dying, were in irons. The scurvy has lately made great havock here. — Particular attention should be paid to air and cleanliness, where prisoners have no employment. Humanity to them, and also to their keepers and visitors, demands this. — The observation of a sensible magistrate at Hanover, here occurs to my mind: "We have found," says he, "that the convicts or slaves who are committed for life, ruin the morals of those who are condemned only for a year or two; therefore, by a late regulation in the electorate, they are now kept apart." — Such a regulation here would be beneficial in every view.

Sect. IV. FRANCE.

In the General Hospital for the poor of both sexes there were about two thousand in May 1783. Those advanced in years are allowed one third of their earnings. There were upwards of three hundred of the girls making lace, for each piece of which they are rewarded with a small donation. Many of the boys, though lodged and boarded here, learn trades in the city; and at twenty years of age, all of both sexes are discharged from the hospital. The girls looked healthy, and their dormitories, infirmaries, and work-rooms were clean. — The internal regulations of this house, and of the infirmary, (Hotel-Dieu), are very good; but (taking up more than twenty quarto pages) they are too long to be inserted.

The two Hospitals La Comtejfe and St. Sanveur are lofty buildings, designed only for the admission of men, for in this city the hospital last described is the only one that takes in women. The patients are distinguished into three clafifes, viz. wounded — very sick — and recovering. Each class has a separate ward, and every patient a separate bed. When a sick person arrives at either of these hospitals, his bed is immediately shewed him; after which one of the fillers brings warm water to him, waflies his feet,. dries them, and kisses one foot. Another brings clean sheets and a clean towel. A man servant makes and warms the bed, and the patient goes directly into it. All the patients are kindly attended by the nuns, but from prejudices caused by their retired mode of living, some inconveniences arise, such as, neglect of washing the rooms and opening the windows; in consequence of which, the wards are rendered offensive, and very unhealthy, particularly in the night-time.

In the prison at Arras I observed one circumstance which was different from what I had seen in France. Of one hundred and thirty-nine prisoners, I saw two in the court who had irons. But upon asking one of them the reason of it, he told me " it was for attempting an escape."

At Amiens are two prisons; one for Les Bourgeois et Le Libertinage; the other, Ld Conciergerie. — In the town-house, I saw great numbers attending the trial of a woman for confining her son. He was then about thirty-two years of age, and had been confined sixteen years, with a severity which had almost deprived him of his intelleds. The prosecution was carried on by his father's relations, who had been long solicitous for his release.

In or near Paris the principal prisons were the Conciergerie, Grand and Petit Chatelet, For-P Eveque, V Abbaye, and the Biretre. But at my visit in 1783 I found two of the word of them, Petit Chatelet and For-P Eveque, with their horrid dungeons, entirely demolished. The debtors now are sent to a new prison, the Hotel de la Force; and criminals are sent to the Conciergerie, or the Grand Chatelet. — The king's Declaration for-this alteration, dated the 30th of August 1780, contains some of the most humane and enlightened sentiments respecting the conduct of prisons. It mentions the construction of airy and spacious infirmaries for the sick; separate places of confinement, and courts, for men and women, and for prisoners of different classes; and a total abolition of under-ground

dungeons, upon this principle, that it is unjust, that those who may poffiblybe innocent, should beforehand suffer a rigorous punishment.

Most prisons in the city have three or four doors, from four feet to four and a half high, separated from each other by a little area or court. Within the inner door is, in some prisons, a turnsstile. The number and lowness of the doors (at each of which you must stoop) and the turnstiles, effectually prevent the prisoners rushing out.

In most of the prisons there are five or six turnkeys, viz. two or three at the doors: one walking in the court, to prevent conferring and plotting (a circumstance to which French gaolers are very attentive): one at the women's ward: and every day one of them is abroad, or otherwise at lcifure. This liberty they have in rotation. They are strictly prohibited, under severe penalties, from receiving any thing of the prisoners, directly or indirectly, on any pretence whatever. The gaoler is obliged to board them; and to pay each of them at lead one hundred livres a year.

I was surprised at seeing that none of the prisoners in the courts were in irons. No gaoler (I was informed) may put them on a prisoner, without an express order from the judge. And yet in some of the prisons, there were more criminals than in any of our London gaols. When I was first there, the number had been recently increased by an insurrection on account of the scarcity of corn. My reader will perhaps presently see reason to conclude, that the manner in which prisons are conducted makes the confinement more tolerable, and chains less needful. Indeed it was evident, from the very appearance of the prisoners in some of the gaols, that humane attention was paid to them.

Most of the courts are paved , and they are washed in summer once or twice a day. One would hardly believe how this freshens the air in the upper rooms. I felt this very sensibly once and again when I was in the chambers: and an Englishmen, who had the misfortune to be a prisoner, made the same remark. I seldom or ever found in any French prison that offensive smell which I had often perceived in English gaols. I sometimes thought these courts were the cleanest places in Paris. One circumstance that contributed to it, besides the number of turnkeys, was that most of them were near the river.

As prisoners are not properly separated, it is difficult to keep such as become the king's evidence apart from the rest: the gaoler of Le Petit Ckdtelet was obliged to fit up a separate room for that purpose.

Prisoners, especially criminals, attend mass almost every day, and the gaoler or a turnkey with them: but such of them as are Protestants are excused. No person is admitted into any prison during the time of divine service.

As condemned criminals generally throw off all reserve, and by relating their various adventures and success, prove pernicious tutors to young and less practised offenders , care is taken to prevent this mifehies, by sending those who are sentenced

Sect. IV. FRANCE. 167

to the galleys, to a separate prison, La‘Tournelle, near the Port de St. Bernard; where Paris. they are kept till the time for their being carried off. Before they are sent hither they are branded. Some continue here many months; but their term commences two days after sentence. I heard that about two- hundred were sent from that prison to Marseilles and Toulon, a week or two before I was there, in 1776. At my visit in 1778, I found only fifteen prisoners, who were chained two and two together. In 1783, there were ninety-three. Their daily allowance is one pound and a half of good bread, and half a pound of meat, and soup.- On maigre days they are allowed pease in their soup. On their journey they have two pounds of bread, half a pound of meat, a pint of wine, and about a quarter of a pound of cheese, or eggs. They are sent from hence to Marseilles, Toulon, Brest, &c. on the 25th of May and the 10th of September, and are joined with many other convicts from the provinces. I was informed, that in May 1778, one hundred and sixty-three went off from this prison.

To prevent the frequent consequences of desperation, no one condemned to death by the inferior court is without hopes of life, till the parliament confirms or reverses the sentence: and they never make known their decision, till the morning of the day on which- a prisoner is to- suffer. Then they publish a confirmation of the former sentence; and it is sold in the streets. Executions are often in the afternoon: the last that I saw was by torch-light: but the criminal was almost dead by the torture before his execution.

The chambers are opened at seven in the morning, from November 1st to Easter; at six, from Easter to November: and shut in the evening at six, from November 1st to Easter; at seven, from Easter to November. But debtors have an hour more at night. This they commonly spend in the court , as they do not choose to be there in the day-time, among felons. Common-side prisoners are obliged to come out of their night-rooms at the forementioned morning hours; experience having shewn, that lying in bed and idleness, are productive of the scurvy and other distempers. Women are kept quite separate from men.

---

Taking garnish, or footing, is strictly prohibited. If prisoners demand of a new comer any thing of that sort, on whatever pretence; if, in order to obtain it, they distress him by hiding his clothes &c. they are shut up for a fortnight in a dark dungeon, and suffer other punishment. They are obnoxious to the same chastisement for hiding one another's clothes, or being otherwise injurious.

The daily allowance to criminals is a pound and a half of good bread, and some soup. The soup is not made, nor is any other provision dressed, in the prisons. They have clean linen once a week, from a society, which was instituted about the year 1753. The occasion of it was the prevalence of a contagious disease which in France they call le scorbut, the scurvy. This distemper was found to proceed from the prisons; and to spread in the Hotel-Lieu, whither prisoners that had it were

removed. The cause of it was generally thought to be want of cleanliness in prisons;

where several of those confined had worn their linen for many months, and infc&ed the most healthy new-comers that were put in the room with them. Eight hundred were ill of it at once in the hospital of St. Louis, to which all that were sick of it in the Hotel-Dieu had been carried. By the Abbe Breton's exerting himself on this occasion, a fund was raised to support prisoners in the Grand Chatelet with clean linen every week. This put an effectual flop to the malady in that prison. Numbers afterwards joined the society; the King and Queen honoured it with their contributions; and the charity extended to three other prisons: so that at last, seven hundred prisoners were provided for in the same manner, and a flock of linen requisite for that purpose, viz. five thousand shirts, was completed. The elder prisoners have charge of the linen that is in the prison; they receive it (every Saturday) and return it, and are gratified by the society; which continues to the present time*,

Besides this, there is scarce a prison in the city that has not a patroness -f; a lady of character, who voluntarily takes care that those in the infirmaries be properly

attended; supplies them with fuel, and linen , does many kind offices to the prisoners in general; and by soliciting the charity of others, procures not only the relief and comforts mentioned already, but soup twice a week, and meat once a fortnight.

There is also annually at each prison somewhat like our charity sermons; public service in the chapel, -and a collection. On these occasions the patroness attends; as I saw at Christmas 1778, and soon after found the prisoners supplied with clothes.

Those who deep on straw, pay the gaoler no fee at entrance, or discharge; but they pay one fou or halfpenny a day; and have clean straw once a month: those in the dungeons, once a fortnight. These latter are seldom let out; never in the court.

All the regulations are ordered to be read in the chapel to prisoners, the first Sunday of every month, by the chaplain; and they are hung up in the prison for common inspection. If any prisoner tears, or otherwise damages them, he suffers corporal punishment: if a register or gaoler does so, he is fined twenty livres: if a turnkey, he is discharged.

The discipline observed is so exact, that at the fire in the Conciergerie, the numerous prisoners (as I was informed) were removed without any confusion, or

a single escape. There are good rules for preserving peace for suppressing pro-faneness; for prohibiting gaolers or turnkeys abusing prisoners by beating them or otherwise X; forbidding their furnishing them with wine or spirituous liquors,

For a further account of this viiji useful institution, see Code de la Police. 1767. Tom. I. p. 510, &c. f Prefor teres ou Dames de charile.

I Monfienr Guy da Roujfeaud de la Combe, in his Traite des Malieres Criminelles, Paris, 1769, quarto, 6th edition, cites at page 339, an arret of parliament in the last century, that condemned a gaoler to be hanged, feecause he let a prisoner perish for want of food.

Sect. IV. FRANCE. 169

so as to cause excess, drunkenness, &c. Keepers are punished for this, when known to the magistrates, by a fine for the first offence; and for the second by {tripes.

They are allowed to sell some things to their prisoners; but the quality, quantity and price must be such as the ordinances of police define and require.

The turnkeys visit the dungeons four times a day; in the morning when the prisons are opened, at noon, at six in the evening, and at ten at night. I was sorry to find the humanity which is so conspicuous in the forementioned, and other excellent rules, so deficient as to continue the use of those subterraneous abodes; which are totally dark, and beyond imagination horrid and dreadful. Poor creatures are confined in them night and day for weeks, for months together. If the turnkeys find any prisoners sick, they must acquaint the physician and surgeon, who visit them; and if needful, order them to more wholesome rooms till they recover.

A prisoner of rank, a very sensible man, to whom I was speaking concerning gaolers in 1778, said, "They pay nothing to the crown, and their revenue was not small; at the Conciergerie, it is about fifteen thousand livres; at the Grand Chatelet, twenty thousand; at Fol I'Eveque, twenty thousand; at the Petit-Chatelet, twelve thousand; at VAbbaye, ten thousand. And all things considered," he added, prisoners have no just reason to complain of this class of men in France."

The nomination of a gaoler belongs to the magistrates. When he has been nominated, he is proposed to the procureur general; and if, after a careful inquiry into his character, it appears that he has the reputation of a man of probity, he is fixed in the office, and takes an oath of fidelity. The office is freely given him without any expence whatever; so that keepers are not tempted, by paying for their places, to oppress their prisoners: to remove all pretext for so doing, rents which they formerly paid to the crown are remitted, and the leases given up.

As for debtors, their number is small. Of the two hundred and two prisoners in The Conciergerie, in 1778, but six wert debtors. In the other prisons there were a few more. This perhaps is owing to the following good arrets. Every bailiff who arrests and imprisons a debtor, must pay to the gaoler in advance, a month's aliment or subsistence, i. e. ten livres ten sous, equal to nine shillings English (provisions are at Paris cheaper in general than at London): and if the like sum be not paid within fourteen days after the end of every month, the prisoner is set at liberty. Besides this, the debtor pays no costs of arrests, &c. The whole of them falls on the creditor; and so do all expences occasioned by his sickness or death.

As the best regulations are liable to be abused, prisoners are not thought sufficiently provided for by enabling good laws: the execution of them is carefully

attended to The substitutes of the attorney-general (should) visit the-prisons once a week, to inquire if the rules be observed; to hear complaints of prisoners; to see if the sick be properly attended; and the like. — Besides this, the parliament of Paris fends to all the prisons five times a year two or three coimjellors with a substitute of

170 FOREIGN PRISONS.

[Paris.]

the attorney-general, and two clerks. They go at Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide, one day before 15th August, St. Simon and Jude. There is in each prison (as in other foreign gaols) a room for their reception called the council-chamber. It is occupied at other times by the head-gaoler.

The arrival of this deputation is announced by boys, who, though offenders, are allowed to do little errands in the prison: these go round the court and into every room, giving notice of it aloud. The deputies go, without the gaoler or turnkeys, into every room and dungeon, and

id. They ask the prisoners one by one, if they have any complaint to make of the gaoler or his servants. But they never meddle with those who are confined by an order from the king.

2. They receive the petitions of prisoners who have been detained too long without trial.

3. In case of debts not exceeding.two thousand livres (about ninety pounds) if the debtor can raise a third part of his debt, and no more, they receive it for the creditors. How they clear him of the remaining two thirds, I will shew presently. They take notes of these matters in the prison; and give an account of all to the parliament, at their general public meeting a day or two after.

In behalf of prisoners who have not been tried, the parliament commonly orders the attorney-general to write in their name to the inferior judges, inquiring the causes of delay, or ordering expedition. If a prisoner be acquitted, he is discharged within twenty-four hours.

The laws of France do not in ordinary cases admit a debtor to bail without the consent of his creditor. But in the case mentioned above, the parliament obliges creditors to accept of bail for the remainder of debts under two thousand livres. And even this bail feeras a matter of mere form; for they sometimes take for bail men that are insolvent. I have heard there is no (landing law for this; and that it is rather an immemorial custom: because the parliament enacts a particular law for each case as it occurs. In France there are no insolvent acts. — When prisoners have received their liberty from the king, or their creditors, they cannot be detained a moment for fees, hire of rooms, debts contracted in prison, or on any pretence whatever.

The deputies hear no complaints of the gaoler against his prisoners. When he has any to make, he applies to the chief justice, by whose order the prisoner was committed. If he was imprisoned by an order from the king, he applies to the lieutenant-general of the police; if without such an order, to the lieutenant-criminal.

Besides the deputation now mentioned, the parliament appoints to each prison one of their own body, a counsellor. They always choose a gentleman of fortune and good character: he is called Commissaire de Id Prison. His business is much like 3 that

Sect. IV. FRANCE. 171

that of the deputation; and his office perpetual. By frequent discourse with prisoners I learned, that these officers are very humane to the distressed. They can (as the parliament) oblige creditors to accept one third part of debts under two thousand livres: but they use this power with much caution.

The Conciergerie has an airy court (fifty-five yards by thirty-eight) with a fine piazza. The dungeons are dark and offensive. There is a new infirmary, with beds admitting only one patient in each. At my former visits here was a tap-room, which now, to the honour of the police, is abolished. At several visits in 1783 the prisoners were calm and quiet*.

At the Grand-Chatelet, as well as the Conciergerie, the prisoners pay for their rooms according to their goodness; eyen those who lie on draw pay one fou a night. In this prison there are eight dungeons, which open into dark passages. In four of these dungeons (ten feet eight inches by six feet eight) I saw sixteen prisoners, two in irons, and all lying upon straw -f*.

VAJbbaye is a Prison for the military or guards, and for such debtors as are men of rank. In the debtors rooms a partition of lath and plaster, detached from the brick-wall, answers the end of an expedient to prevent escapes: for if the smallest perforation be made in the partition, it is immediately discovered, by the mortar falling between that and the wall into the keeper's court, through the aperture which is left for that purpose. Here are six small dungeons, in which, as the gaoler said, there were sometimes fifty confined.

[Paris Hotel De La Force.]

The Hotel de la Force, a new Prison for debtors, (vagrants, deserters and petty offenders) has been occupied only from January 1782. It is an airy and spacious building, and has several courts and areas for the reparation of men, and women, and the different kinds of prisoners. The courts are all clean and well supplied with water. The number of debtors were seventy-eight men and eleven women. Over their doors are painted the price to be paid for the beds from five to thirty sous a night. There are also rooms and beds for debtors that cannot pay: all the prisoners that are poor have one pound and a half of bread and soup every day*.

Here are two chapels, an airy infirmary, for each sex; and a well furnished apothecary's shop, from which this, and the other prisons are supplied with drugs. Here are fourteen turnkeys, twelve every day on duty in separate departments; but in case of any riot or disorder they can readily assist one another: two walk in each of the men's courts. — By the list sent into the office of the police, May 17, 1783, the number of prisoners of all descriptions was two hundred and seventy-one, of whom many were deserters.

The arret of parliament of the 19th of February 1782, for the regulation of this prison, containing twenty-nine articles, is ordered to be read in the chapels before all the prisoners on the first Sunday of every month, and to be fixed on the doors of the chapels, and on several other conspicuous parts of the prison†.

[Saint Martin.]

The Prison of Saint Martin is for loose women, who are seldom confined here for more than fourteen days. Here are six rooms for those that pay six livres a month for their beds, and four rooms for those that lie on straw. On the upper floor there are three rooms (called secrete) for the punishment of the refractory. The court is small. At my last visit there were one hundred and fifteen prisoners, so that the rooms were crowded. The damp dungeons are now not used.

[Saint-Eloi.]

The Prison of Saint-Eloi, intended for women, is situated in a very close part of the city. Here were thirty-eight prisoners; some of whom had been confined three or four years. All were troubled with a cutaneous disorder, and some to a very

* At Paris and Bordeaux, in May 1783, the fine white bread was two pence per pound — second sort, three halfpence — and brown bread, eight pounds for nine pence: but at some distance from Paris a list of the weight and price of bread was put up for public inspection, which I here copy.

great degree. No court. Each has one pound and a half of bread a day, and (from a charity) soup four times a week.

At the Hotel-de-ville there are two rooms, in which were two men and a woman.

[Bicetre.]
---
The Bicetre is upon a small eminence about two miles from Paris. If it were only a prison, I should call it an enormous one; but this for men, like the Salpetriere for women, is indeed a kind of general hospital. Of about four thousand men that are within its walls, not one half are prisoners. The majority are; the poor, who wear a coarse brown uniform, and seem as miserable as the poor in some of our country work-houses: the insane: and those that have the venereal disease. Each fort is in a court and apartments totally separate from the other, and from criminals. Some are in little rooms about eight feet square, window three feet and a half by two feet, with a grate, but not many glazed: there is but one prisoner in a room. These pay two hundred livres a year for their board. The number of these rooms is two hundred and ninety-six. There are others in two large rooms called La Force, on the other side of the court (La Cow Royale) which were crowded with prisoners: in 1778; there were upwards of two hundred. Such a number confined together in idleness* must produce a great corruption of manners. Many at their unhappy end have aferibed their ruin to the flagitious examples they had here seen, and the instructions here given them.

Over the two rooms Ld Force, there is a general infirmary: and over that, an in fir5-mary for the fcorbut; a distemper very common and fatal among them. There were sixty-three patients in 1778, most of them ill of this disorder. They contracted it in a year or two, from their confinement, as they were never suffered to go out of their rooms. Many loft the use of their limbs by it. I saw several such miserable objects at St. Louis's hospital, where they are often admitted at the expiration of their term at the Bicetre.

In the middle of Ld Cow Royale are eight dreadful dungeons down sixteen steps: each about thirteen feet by nine: with two strong doors; three chains fastened to the wall; and a stone funnel at one corner of each cell, for air. From the situation of these dreary caverns, and the difficulty I found in procuring admittance, I conclude hardly any other stranger ever saw them: that is my reason, and I hope will be an apology, for mentioning the particulars.
---
Prisoners make straw-boxes, tooth-picks, &c. and sell them to visitants. I viewed the men with some attention; and observed in the looks of many a settled melancholy: many others looked very sickly. This prison is not so well managed as those in the city: it is very dirty: no fire-place in any of the rooms: and in the severe cold in 1775, several hundreds perished.

Water in plenty was thought of such importance here, that they have a stone well which is a curiosity. It was sunk in 1735; is fifteen feet diameter, and near seventy yards deep. The two buckets hold each about three hogsheads: at my former visits

174 FOREIGN PRISONS.

[Paris Bicetre.]

they were drawn up by horses, and emptied themselves into a reservoir, sixty-four feet square, and nine deep. A bucket was drawn up in five minutes. They worked sixteen hours every day, not excepting Sundays; and drew daily about five hundred hog-sheads. Three horses worked at a time, and twelve were kept for the service.

The French are now sensible of the bad police of confining persons in idleness; for of late they have here set their prisoners to work. I saw in 1783, one hundred and twenty employed in three rooms, in polishing &c. plate glass: and the water was drawn by seventy-two prisoners, in three sets, each set working one hour at a time; and five hours in a day. They draw sixteen buckets an hour, and aboat two hundred and forty buckets daily, and are paid for each bucket two sous and a half*. The prisoners are much healthier than they were at my former visits.

[Salpetriere.]

The great hospital, or Salpetriere, near the city, is for women and girls, their number is upwards of five thousand. Many of the girls are employed on the finest embroidery. Here are numbers of poor and insane; and a sisterhood of religieuses reside in the house. The criminals are quite separate from the others, and seldom seen by strangers. There are but few of these employed- — At my last visit there were eight hundred and twenty confined, most of them by their parents or relations. Many of their lodging-rooms are six feet ten inches by five feet seven. There are three infirmaries; in two of them the patients lay in single beds, but the other (for criminals) was crowded, and had three in a bed. The whole house was kept clean and quiet by the great attention of the good sisters.

[Bastille.]

The Bastille may occur to some of my readers, as an object concerning which some information would be acceptable. I am happy to be able to give this, by means of a pamphlet published in 1774, written by a person who was long confined in this prison. It is reckoned the best account of this celebrated structure ever published; and the sale of it being prohibited in France under very severe penalties, it is become extremely scarce. I have extracted the most material circumstances of the description, and have caused the plate to be copied from that in the work.
---
"This castle is a state prison, consisting of eight very strong towers, surrounded with a fofse about one hundred and twenty feet wide, and a wall sixty feet high. The entrance is at the end of the street of St. Antoine, by a drawbridge, and great gates into the court of F Hotel iu Gouvernement; and from thence over another drawbridge to the corps de garde, which is separated by a strong barrier constructed with beams plated with iron, from the great court. This court is about one hundred and twenty feet eighty. In it is a fountain; and six of the towers surround it, which are united by walls of free-done ten feet thick up to the top. At the bottom of this courtls a large modern corps de logis, which separates it from the court du Putts. This court is fifty feet by twenty-five. Contiguous to it, are the other two towers. On the top of the towers is a platform continued in terraces, on which the prisoners are

* Each man draws about 14lb. or half as much as those that are accustomed to labour.

[Plate 18, The Bastille.]

Sect. IV. FRANCE. 175

sometimes permitted to walk, attended by a guard. On this platform are thirteen Bastille, cannons mounted, which are discharged on days of rejoicing. In the corps de logis is the council-chamber, and the kitchen, offices, &c. above these are rooms for prisoners of distinction, and over the council-chamber the king's lieutenant resides. In the court du Putts is a large well for the use of the kitchen.

" The dungeons of the tower de Id Liberte extend under the kitchen, &c. Near that tower is a small chapel on the ground-floor. In the wall of it are five nitches or closets, in which prisoners are put one by one to hear mass, where they can neither see nor be seen.

" The dungeons at the bottom of the towers exhale the most offensive scents, and are the receptacles of toads, rats, and other kinds of vermin. In the corner of each is a camp-bed, made of planks laid on iron bars that are fixed to the walls, and the prisoners are allowed some straw to lay on the beds. These dens are dark, having no windows, but openings into the ditch: they have double doors, the inner ones plated with iron, with large bolts and locks.

" Of the five classes of chambers, the most horrid next to the dungeons are those in which are cages of iron. There are three of them. They are formed of beams with strong plates of iron, and are each eight feet by six.

" The calottes, or chambers at the top of the towers, are somewhat more tolerable.

They are formed of eight arcades of free-stone. Here one cannot walk but in the middle of the room. There is hardly sufficient space for a bed from one arcade to another. The windows, being in walls ten feet thick, and having iron grates within and without, admit but little light. In these rooms the heat is excessive in summer,-and the cold in winter. They have stoves.

" Almost all the other rooms* (of the towers) are octagons, about twenty feet in-diameter, and from fourteen to fitceen high. They are very cold and damp. Each is furnished with a bed of green serge, &c. All the chambers are numbered. The prisoners are called by the name of their tower joined to the number of their room.

" A surgeon and three chaplains relide in the castle. If prisoners of note are dangerously ill, they are generally removed, that they may not die in this prison. —

The prisoners who die there are buried in the parish of St. Paul* under the name of domestics.

" A library was founded by a prisoner who was a foreigner, and died in the Bastille the beginning of the present century. Some prisoners obtain permission to have the use of it.

" One of the centinels on the inside of the castle rings a bell every hour, day and night, to give notice that they are awake: and on the rounds on the outside of the castle they ring every quarter of an hour."

I have inserted so particular an account of this prison, chiefly with a design of inculcating a reverence for the principles of a free constitution like our own, which

will not permit in any degree the exercise of that despotism, which has rendered the name of Bastille so formidable*. I was desirous of examining it myself; and for that purpose knocked hard at the outer gate, and immediately went forward through the guard to the drawbridge before the entrance of the cattle. But while I was contemplating this gloomy mansion, an officer came out much surprised; and I was forced to retreat through the mute guard, and thus regained that freedom, which for one locked up within those walls it is next to impossible to obtain.

Many of my readers, acquainted with the strict police of France, would have supposed that the other prisons would have been as inaccessible to a visitant as the Bastille. And indeed my first application for admittance at the Grand Chatelet was unsuccessful. But fortunately remarking the tenth article-j* of the arret 1717, I pleaded it before the Commissarie de Id Prison, to whom I was referred, and by its means gained admission as well into that prison, as those of Le Petet Chatelet and For-VEveque, and had an opportunity of seeing almost every individual confined in them.

The Hospitals of Saint-Louis and the Hotel-Dieu for the sick, are the two worst hospitals that I ever visited. They were so crowded, that formerly I have often seen five or six in one bed, and some of them dying.

The Hotel-Dieu is situated in the closest part of the city J. The new wards are too low. In 17 83, the hospital was cleaner than at my former visits, but in the great ward (St. Charles.) and in the women's wards, many of the patients were two or three in a bed§.

Sir William Blackstone observes, that the preservation of personal liberty is of great importance to the public:" for if once it were left in the power of any, the highest, magistrate to imprison arbitrarily whomever he or his officers thought proper, (as in France it is daily practised by the crown ||) there would " soon be an end of all other rights and immunities."

|| " I have been assured upon good authority, that, during the mild adminifl ration of cardinal Fleury, above 54,000 hurts dc cachet were issued, upon the tingle ground of the famoui built Unigemtus.' Commentaries, Book I. Chap. 1.

t One cannot but wish, that after the fire in the Hotel-Dieu a few years since, the hospital had been removed to a more airy situation.

The Hospital of Saint-Louis Hands out of the city. There is a considerable ascent to the wards, and there is no floor over them. They were dirty and noisy, and in many of the beds there were three patients. — According to the lists I procured at my visits in 1783, the number of patients was.

May 6, Hotel-Dieu. 1709> St. Louis. — 662.

16, J7°7> — 694.

Number received in 1782, 21484, — 3898.

Died 3899* — 899.

Though these two hospitals are a disgrace to Paris, it has many other charitable foundations which do honour to it; and from which this country may derive useful information.

The Hospital of La Charite for men, is one of the best in Paris. There are now two hundred and three beds, and another ward is nearly finiftied, twenty-six feet and a half wide. All the patients lie single; the furniture of their beds is green, and they wear a uniform of the same colour. Here is lately made a convenient walk for the patients. The presentation of beds is bought, and descends to heirs; the price for a bed is twelve thousand livres, as I was informed by one of the fathers. The beds are always occupied; except three or four which are reserved, that immediate attention may be always paid to a patron's presentation. This hospital does honour to the order of St. Jean de Lieu: the friars chambers are over the wards, which I think improper, because it may occasion the windows of the wards to be too often ftiut.

This fraternity has also the charge of the hospital for Convalescents, which consists of a hall with a brick-floor containing twenty-one beds. Adjoining is a refectory, where the patients (who continue here only eight days) have four meals a day, viz. at fix, nine, twelve and a half, and five o'clock. They are allowed meat and wine every day in the year, Good-Friday excepted. I wish the French physicians were convinced of the ne-ceflity of washing (not sprinkling) the wards.

The Hopital des petites-Maisons is situated in a spacious garden or court, containing a number of small houses for the aged and infirm of both sexes, and single rooms for the insane. Here are also six rooms for the sick, in which are a hundred and thirteen beds; a new room for forty beds is not yet occupied. The good fifters kindly attend. The neatness and cleanliness I observed here engaged me often to repeat my visits. —

My learned friend Dr. Price will be pleased to find feme alteration for the better in the Hotel-Dieu, for the number that died in 1782 was considerably under a fifth of those that were admitted. See his Reversionary Payments, vol. I. />. 296. 4th edit.

Rooms in the hospital and beds in the sick wards are bought by the opulent, as asylums for aged domestics and poor friends.

Madame Necker's hospital is a noble example of private charity. It has beds for seventy men and sixty women, who are attended by fourteen of the fillers. The medical and chirurgical patients are separated. I advised washing the men's wards but my advice has not been taken.

In the Hopital des Incurables there are about four hundred persons, most of them aged and infirm, and clothed in a neat uniform; the men in grey, the women in black. Each has a bed, two chairs, a table and a cupboard. The furniture is changed twice in a year, in winter it is green woollen, in summer white linen; the house is then thoroughly cleansed: the rooms on the ground-floor open (very properly) into a spacious and pleasant garden. The provisions were good, and served by the fitters, forty of whom have the care of this hospital. — A presentation here, formerly bought for ten thousand five hundred livres, is now raised to twelve thousand.

The Quinze-vingts hospital was founded in 1260 for the accommodation of three hundred blind persons. Formerly they used to beg in the churches for subsistence; but lately, in consequence of the attention of Cardinal Rohan, and an increase of the rents, an income sufficient for supporting them has been obtained, and is now settled on them by an arret of March 14, 1783. They are divided into three clafies; single persons, who have twenty sous a day — married, twenty-six — and those who have been married twenty-two or twenty-three years, thirty-six sous: these allowances are paid every month. Each person has three pounds of salt given him thrice in the year. Wood for firing is also given to the most necefiitous. The parents of children are allowed two sous a day for every child under sixteen; besides a sum to put out their children to apprenticeships. Every indulgence is granted of walking out, visiting friends, &c. Several who have families increase the means of their subsistence by keeping little shops. There were fifty-two of the third class at my visit in 1783. — The regulations are hung up on the walls in several places. There are two rooms for confining the disorderly.

An infirmary is designed, and oculifts are to be appointed, who, besides attending the infirmary, are to attend twice in the week to give advice to others who may apply to them. An annual sum is likewise to be offered for the best distertation on disorders of the eyes. — This hospital is a privileged place: and a chapel belongs-to it in which divine service is constantly performed.

At the Foundling-hospital near the Hotel-Dieu, the infants lie in neat cradles with white furniture. May 21, 1783, there were here only fifty, the reason of which is, that they are sent into the country soon after they are received. They remain in the country five or six years, and when they are brought back, most of the girls are placed at S alp e trier e, and the rest with the boys in the suburb of St. Antoine; in which last place there were at this time four hundred and fifty boys and girls. — I learned from the

lists which are made out every month, that the whole number of foundlings on this foundation on the ift of May 1783, was thirteen thousand seven hundred and eighty; seven. }

In the provincial gaols I saw little worth noting, but what has been already mentioned at Paris. These also have charitable patronefifes, who take care that the prisoners be not defrauded of their allowance; and procure them.farther relief. But these prisons do not seem to be so carefully inspected as those in the city; although the arrets of parliament for regulation of both are for the most part similar, and were made in the same year, 1717. They are drawn up with found judgment, and accurate knowledge of the complex subject. I found many articles of them in the laws of other nations; but cannot say whether the French arrets were compiled from them, or followed by them*.

The 3 2d article of the arret for the provinces requires that prisons be "au raiz de chaujjee," level with the ground.f. Yet at Chalions, and some other towns, I saw many prisoners in dungeons; larger indeed, but in other respects not much better than those at Paris. In the four horrid ones at the Prison de St. Joseph (formerly a' convent) at Lyons, June 1776, were twenty-nine criminals: the heat so excessive, that few of them had any other garment on than their shirts. Some of them were sick: none looked healthy. In the nine other rooms of that gaol there were one hundred and twenty-eight prisoners; of which number twenty-two were women.

To the Pierre-en cize3 a state prison at Lyons, you afeend by more than two hundred steps: among the few prisoners in it, I- fat talking a while with one who said he was in the fiftieth year of his confinement.

I cannot leave this city without giving a short account of the Hotel-Dieu, as it is the best hospital I have seen in France. It is near the Rhone; the principal building is in the form of a cross, near three hundred feet from end to end both ways. The wards thirty-two feet wide, and twenty-five feet high; with apertures between the joists of the floor above, and two tier of windows; in many of them two casements. Three rows of iron bedsteads in each ward. Under a dome in the centre is an octagon altar, in view from every part of the cross. Prayers, which are read there twice a day, can be heard through the wards. This part of the house is for those

They are printed in quarto. The arret for the city is dated 18th June: it contains thirty-nine articles. The title is Arreji de la Cour du Parlement, portant RegLment general pour les Prisons, droits et fonSlions des Greffiers des Geales, Geoliers et Guichetiers defdites Prisons: Avec le Tarif des droits attribute aufdits Geoliers. The arret for the provinces, dated ill September, has the same title, except the farif. It contains thirty-three articles. To this arret is annexed three others, viz. the office of clerks, gaolers and turnkeys — the aliment of prisoners — -and their attendance at mass.

+ The foundation of this was probably the first article upon prisons in the excellent criminal Ordonnance de Louis XIV. 1670, which directs that they shall be so disposed that the health of prisoners shall not be incommoded.

that have fevers. There are other wards for the wounded 3 for lying-in-women; for foundlings; for the insane: all separate: and a room for chirurgical operations. The cross-wards are so airy, as not to be in the least offensive: and yet there are, in another part of the house, two upper rooms still more airy and pleasant (chambres de convalescence): to these they remove patients that are recovering; and those whom I saw there said they were very refreshing. They come down from them at meals to a refectory. These rooms soon complete the patients recovery; and seem an excellent precaution against the flow hettic fever, of which our hospital-physicians so frequently complain*. The whole was clean and quiet. There are eight chaplains; nine physicians and surgeons; and twelve fillers. These are ladies of a religious order, dressed in a neat uniform, who make up, as well as administer, all the medicines prescribed; for which purpose there is an elabor tory and apothecary's shop, consisting of five or six apartments, the neatest and most elegantly fitted up that can be conceived. — The front also of this hospital being very elegant, I give the plate.

At the Tdown-house in Bordeaux April 27, 1783, there were in three rooms down twenty-seven Heps fifteen prisoners in irons, who told me they were never out. In two rooms down thirty-one Heps there were ten men, and in another room a woman. On the ground-floor there were many confined for flight offences.

In the Palais (the prison for the province), the men were in the court. The windows of the women's two rooms were (improperly) towards the street.

The House of correction (Maison de Force) is in a convent. The rooms were neat and clean. There were twenty-four women at needle-work, who put on their veils when I entered the hall.

The great Hospital is in a close part of the city. The wards for men are on the first floor round a quadrangle. The women have three wards on the ground-floor, one for medical patients; one for chirurgical (bleffee), the other for those that are very ill. In many of the wards there were two in a bed. This hospital is kept clean, as it is under the care of the rdigieuses; who have also the care of the foundling hospital which is a. spacious building near the river.-

At La Prison Royale, or the new prison, at St. Omer's, the daily allowance is a pound and a half of bread, and soup. The prisoners have clean linen every week.

In the prison at Dunkirk, the French prisoners were in two or three rooms by themselves.

I was induced to take such particular notice of this hospital, from the recollection of something similar to these chambers of convalescence proposed by my ingenious friend Mr. Atkin of Warrington, in his Thoughts on Hospitals. I had not the pamphlet then with me, but have since turned to the passage,

and find he advises that "all patients capable of fitting up, should remain through the day in large airy halls."

Prisoners of War.

Here (January 1779) I found many of my countrymen prisoners of war. In five rooms there were a hundred and thirty-three — captains, mates, passengers and common Jailors all crowded together — who lay on straw, with one coverlet for every three persons. In three other rooms there were thirteen accommodated in a better manner, because most of them were ranfomers, and capable of paying six sous a night for their beds The court was small, being only forty-two feet by twenty-six; nor was there sufficient plenty of water. The bread, beer, and soup were good, and the beef tolerable. In a

former war, the contract here was twelve sous a man; in the last it was fifteen. Each

room was supplied with two small faggots a day for firing. The sick (of whom there were only three) were taken to the military hospital. The regulations were hung up in English f and French.

† BY THE KING.

Rules to be observed by all Prisoners of War in the Kingdom of France.

Article I. THE orders given by the commissary of the marines encharged with the care of the prisoners are to be strictly complied with unargued and undisputed. None of the prisoners shall insult, threaten or abuse, much less strike the turnkey, nor any of those appointed to do business in the prison, under the penalty of incurring such punishment as shall be ordered by the commissary of the marines, and of losing turn of being exchanged; nay, further they shall be close confined and deprived of one half of their food or pittance.

Art. II. All and every prisoner, when the commissary makes review, shall answer to their name or names, and if in the list delivered to the commissary there be found any error, they shall point it out, that it may be rectified, in order to prevent the confusion that might result from mistaking of names.

Art. III. All prisoners that shall refuse to answer to their names at the review, shall be punished by being deprived of their food till such time as they submit to the call.

Art. IV. If there happen any damage to the place where the prisoners are kept, whether it be with intent to make an escape, or otherwise purposely and wilfully committed, the expense for repairing such damage shall be paid out of the food of those that are found guilty of the infringement, and if there be no means of discovering the guilty persons, all the prisoners shall contribute an equal share out of their food to the charges of such repair.

Art. V. Whoever after escape from his prison is retaken, shall be shut in a dungeon, and shall be stinted to half his pittance of food, till he has by this confinement satisfied for the expenses made for seizing and bringing him back to gaol, and shall lose his turn of exchange besides. A sea-officer thus contravening, shall from that moment be looked upon and treated as a common sailor.

Art. VI. It is forbidden to fight, quarrel, or make any riot in the prisons or places where the prisoners are allowed to take the air, under pain of incurring such punishment as the offence may require.

Art. VII. The prisons shall be kept clean and neat by the sailors, every man in his turn as shall be regulated, and whatever sailor shall refuse this service in his turn, his food shall be withheld from him till he submit to it.

Art. VIII. The prisoners are to inform the commissary of the clothes or other necessaries they may want, and can pay for, and the commissary shall not only allow them to be provided with such things, but shall also take care they be not imposed upon in the price.

[Bergues.]

[Prisoners of War.]

In the prison at Bergues I found forty-seven English prisoners. The table of victualling was hung up here as at Dunkirk, but the provisions were not so good. There were twelve on their parole in this town, nine at Bourbourg, and two at Ardres, who told me they had procured bondsmen for their security.

[Calais.]

The common Prison at Calais, being smaller than that at Dunkirk, was much crowded: for it contained one hundred and twenty-seven English prisoners. Seventeen sailors lay in one room* on straw, without coverlets; a few had not even straw: on my complaining, of this to the commissary, he said, he would send to St. Omer's for coverlets. After informing him farther, that I had found captains, passengers and mates confined in France, but that I supposed persons of this description in England

Art. IX. In every prison the prisoners may appoint three or five of themselves, and change them at their pleasure, in order to inspect their victuals and see if they be good, and if they have their share or portion whether in weight or measure according to the following victualling table; and if there arise any reason for complaint, either of dressing, serving them up, or otherwise, they are with decency to apprise the commissary of it, who finding such complaint well grounded shall give immediate redress and do them justice.

Art. X. It shall be allowed to tradesmen or sellers of ware (except such as deal in things that are not fit to be sold to prisoners) to wait at the great gate of the prisons from ten o'clock in the morning till three in the afternoon, in order to sell their ware to such prisoners as have wherewithal to pay for them on the spot.

Art. XI. Whatever prisoner shall dare by this means to take or bring in strong liquors or other things that are not fit for prisoners, or shall receive or deliver any letter, shall be punished for the abuse he has made of this facility.

were on their parole of honour; he replied, and desired I would note it down, that " a parole could not be granted without security; a hundred guineas for captains, seventy-five for mates, sixty for sailors, and twenty-five for boys." Passengers were on the same footing with captains. On the second day of my being the re, the rules (the same as at Dunkirk) were hung up, both within and without this prison.

Many of the prisoners in this and other prisons had no change of linen, and some were almost entirely destitute of clothes, being the crews of vessels shipwrecked in the great storm of December 31ft, 1778.

There were twenty-six of our people in a spacious ward in the military hospital, to whom great attention was paid. Each had a bed and sheets; and their bread and meat were good. But most of them having a disorder which did not break their spirits, they would have been better pleased if their allowance had been equal to that in the prison.

I shall close this part, with reciting a few particulars'which I think of consequence in the Construction and Regulation of Hospitals, most of which have been collected from the observations I have made abroad.

SECTION V. PRISONERS OF WAR in ENGLAND, &c.

WHEN I visited my countrymen confined as prisoners of war in France, some of the commissaries and other gentlemen informed me, that they had received great complaints from the French prisoners in England. On my return in January 1779, I waited on the of of the sick and wounded seamen, and gave them an account of the English prisoners in France, and of my intention to visit the French prisoners. In order to assist me in this business, they very readily favoured me with letters to their agents at several prisons.

Having determined to take another general view of English prisons, to see what improvements had been made, in consequence of two late acts of parliament *, and of the charges given by the Judges in their circuits to the grand juries, I chose to begin my tour in those parts where most of the French prisoners were confined; and of them, therefore, I shall first give some account: in my narrative I now add my observations in 1782 on these and other prisoners of war, to whom I paid peculiar attention.

In the Mill-prison near Plymouth, February 3, 1779, there were three hundred and ninety-two French prisoners. The wards and courts in which they were confined, were not so spacious as those appropriated to the American prisoners, nor were they so well accommodated with provisions. The hospital, which had fifty patients in it, was dirty and offensive.

In the ship Cambridge there were three hundred and ninety-six prisoners; and the next day, two hundred and fifty more were coming in — The bread was heavy, and the meat bad; and too little attention was then paid to the sick. An hospital ship, called the Tiger > was fitting up for an infirmary f.

At my visit, July 30, 1782, the old prison was disused, and there were a hundred and eighty-seven French, two Spanish and seven Dutch in a new prison. This is situated on an eminence; the wards are spacious (twenty feet nine inches wide).

14th Geo. III. Cap. XLIII. and 16th G«.III. Cap. XLIII. f This was an infirmary till the hospital which they were building near Mill-prison was finished.

and there is a large area. In the infirmary, the cradles (or bedsteads) are similar to those in the royal hospital *. — All the French prisoners embarked the next day in a cartel.

None of the windows in the wards of this prison (or in that at Shrewsbury) were glazed; they had (Venetian) blinds similar to those in distilleries (fee Plate II. A). This and the airy situation greatly contributed to the health of the prisoners, who also had the advantage of Dr. Farr*s frequent visits.

Of the American prisoners, two hundred and twenty-eight had the small-pox, a hundred and eighty-two of them were inoculated at their own desire. — Twenty-five of the French prisoners died of their wounds.

At Bristol, in a prison which had been a pottery, there were a hundred and fifty-one French prisoners, Feb. 9, 1779. The wards were more spacious, and less crowded than those of the prison near Plymouth. There were two day-rooms, in which many shoe-makers, tailors, &c. were at work: an advantage which the prisoners at Plymouth desired, but could not obtain. — The bread was good. — There being no infirmary, the sick were attended and victualled at a small house near the prison, where seven shillings a week was paid for each patient. There were five in that house, in a dirty and offensive room. — March 2, 1782, there was a new prison, built on a rising ground about three miles from the city (two hundred and fifty-six feet by forty-five), consisting of two floors, each of which having a partition, the wards were twenty-one feet wide. There was no chimney: the wards were dirty, being never washed. Adjoining, is a spacious infirmary, which has a fire-place in each ward, and a detached kitchen. The whole was enclosed by a low wall and pales. Here were seven hundred and seventy-four Spanish, and thirteen Dutch prisoners. Their guard was fifty of the militia. — The bread was not so good, and the prisoners had not that attention paid them, as when the prison was in the city. — Here was painted on a board, that an open market is allowed from ten to three.

By Dr. Farr's order,- a board under the beds in the infirmary is brushed with the til of tar; which corrects the noxious effluyia, and is an agreeable scent. — In most of the hospitals in Denmark and Russia, and also the houses in Sweden, the floors are strewed with the young shoots of the fir.

There were a thousand and sixty-two French prisoners in the prison at Winchester, March 2, 1779. The wards are lofty and spacious. The area large. The meat and beer were good: but the bread (being made with leaven and mixed with rye) was not so good as that at Bristol *. If two or three of the rooms had been used as work-rooms, the health of the prisoners would have been promoted, and they would not have been indolently lying in their hammocks in the day-time; as I observed they were, both here and at Millprison.

Several prisoners were confined in the dark hole. — Forty days confinement on half allowance, in order to pay ten shillings to those that apprehend them after escapes, seems to be too severe a punishment. On such occasions, the observation of the worthy magistrates at Bern always occurs to my mind, "that every one must be desirous of regaining liberty."

The hospital wards were lofty, and upwards of twenty feet wide. Each patient had a cradle, bedding and sheets; and the surgeon paid them great attention f.

Feb. 26, 1782, the prison was cleaner than at my former visit, and there were many improvements in the wards and courts. The well was in order. The number of prisoners was three hundred and twenty-eight French, three hundred and forty-nine Dutch, and seven hundred and thirty Spanish, besides in the infirmary, nine French, thirty-nine Dutch, and thirty-seven Spanish. — On inquiring for the attentive surgeon, I was sorry to hear, he had died of the gaol-fever, which was fatal to many in this prison.

In a prison not very convenient at For ton near Gosport, there were a hundred and seventy-seven French prisoners, March 2, 1779. On that day the meat was very bad, and had been kilied, as the butcher's servant said, that morning: but it was returned, and Mr. Newsham the agent procured them good meat instead of it. — Most of the fix-pound loaves wanted weight. I favv the bread weighed for a hundred and forty-two prisoners, and observed a deficiency of three pounds. — The straw, by long use, was turned to dull in the mattrefifes, and many of them here, and at other places, had been emptied to clear them of vermin. The floors of the bed-rooms and hospitals could not but be dirty and offensive, the boards having been laid rough. I took notice of this kind of bad policy in all the floors of the new prison which was then building here, and aimed! finished.

The regulations were in the French language, and were the same with those published in a former war. They were evidently the original from which those

I particularly observed the bread-, for in France it was remarkably good and well baked. — The prisoners are much happier when an attention is paid to this article.

t Mr. Smith the agent also was assiduous in his department. He mentioned to me, in 1779, that he thought it would be an advantage if one of their priests (two of whom were at a little dillance on their parole) were permitted to attend the prisoners. This, he said, would be the means of comforting some, of awing others, and of giving information whenever there was any jujl jeafon for complaints. — At my visit in 1782, the Reman catholic prisoners had fitted up a little chapel.

printed in page 181 are translated. For the fake of greater accuracy, they will be given at the end of the book. I was informed both here and at Winchester, that they had been hung up, but were torn down. The regulations in the Spanish language were the same as those in the French. — It would be better, to paint them on a board, which should be fattened in some conspicuous place in every prison.

On the prisoners complaining that the bread was too light and the meat bad, I referred them to the ninth article of the regulations, by which they are directed to apply to the agent, and (if not redressed) to the of One of them pertinently replied, " How is that possible, when every letter is examined by the agent*?"

At my visit November 6, 1782, I found there was no separation of the Americans from other prisoners of war, and they had the same allowance of bread, viz. one pound and a half each. There were a hundred and fifty-four French, thirty-four Dutch, and a hundred and thirty-three Americans; of these, twelve French, twenty-five Dutch, and nine Americans were in the hospital. The wards "were not clean f. No regulations hung up. I weighed several of the fix-pound loaves, and they all wanted some ounces of weight.

The American prisoners then had an allowance from the States, paid by order of Dr. Franklin. I found a gentleman of Portsmouth distributing this kind allowance. From Lady-day to Michaelmas, officers received one shilling per week, and seamen six-pence: and from Michaelmas to Lady-day, officers two shillings and seamen one shilling per week. American officers were not on parole as other officers.

There was a new temporary Prison at Deal, It had an airy and spacious room below, and another above, and a convenient kitchen. — The regulations were hung up, the loaves were full weight, the provisions of all forts were good, and the mattresses had plenty of draw.

agents or contractors, and I had the pleasure of hearing the prisoners express their satisfaction.

The prison adjoins to the naval hospital, the wards of which were clean and not in the least offensive. In this the sick and wounded prisoners had the convenience of a ward, funilar to that which the English prisoners had at Dunkirk and Calais; and were attended by a skilful and humane surgeon. There were seventy-three in the prison, and fifteen in this ward, April 17, 1779: and twenty-eight French and three Dutch December 5, 1782, and only one sick.

In the county gaol at Carlisle, in one large room in the debtors ward, there were twelve French prisoners. May 10, 1779. They were not supplied with hammocks, as at Plymouth, Winchester, &c. but lay on straw without coverlets. Their allowance, six-pence a day.

On the 5th and 6th of June 1779, I visited the prisons at Pembroke. There were fifty-six French prisoners in an old house adjoining to that in which the Americans were confined. Most of them had no shoes or stockings, and feme were also without shirts. — They had no victualling table, nor did they know what was their allowance. There were two or three who had their allowance in money, which should have been three shillings and six-pence a week each for their aliment, but six-pence was deducted. They lay, in general, on the boards without strawj for there were but four hammocks in two rooms, each of which contained eighteen prisoners. Here was a court-yard, but no water or fewer.

In the two rooms of the town gaol there were twenty French prisoners. They had some straw, but it had not been changed for many weeks. Having no supply of water in the gaol, and not being permitted, as they were at the other prison, to fetch water for themselves, they were often neglected. On Sunday at noon, no water had been brought to them from Friday evening. — They w asked in a field, with a guard, about an hour every day. — Their bread was tolerable, but their beer very small, and their allowance of beef so scanty, that they preferred to it an allowance of cheese and butter.

At a house appropriated for an hospital, there were nine French prisoners, besides five of the crew of the Culloden mail of war, and three Americans. These lay in

three or four rooms on straw with, coverlets, but without sheets, mattresses or bedsteads.

At my visit October 21, 1782, there was a new prison. Two rooms; one on the ground-floor, the other over it (thirty-six feet by sixteen) very dirty and offensive, though there were only six French prisoners. They had been confined to their rooms on short allowance from the fourteenth of September for making an escape. The bedding was on the floor; the straw in some of the mattresses had not been changed for eighteen weeks. The prisoners said they were half starved; the bread was very brown, and the weight of the daily allowance only sixteen ounces. No regulations were hung up. — The former agent was dismissed.

No agent, or relation of any agent, should be concerned in any contract relative to prisoners of war.

Such observations as these have convinced me, that humanity and good policy require that inspectors of the prisoners of war should be appointed, who should be desired to report quarterly their (late as to health, provisions, &c. No doubt some independent gentlemen in the neighbourhood would accept such an humane office without a salary.

In another view, also, such an appointment would be advantageous. These prisons are usually guarded by the militia, and the centinels have in several instances shewn themselves too ready to fire on the prisoners, in which they have been countenanced by inexperienced officers. Several persons have thus been killed on the spot, though perhaps there was no serious design of an escape. The agent is too much in awe of the officers to make due inquiries and representations on these occasions; whereas an independent gentleman would probably exert himself in a proper manner.

At Chester Castle, Aug. 27, 1779, there were twenty-three French prisoners of war. They were healthy and well, and made no complaint.

At Liverpool, Nov. 30, 1779, were five hundred and nine prisoners of war, all French, except fifty-six Spaniards, who were kept separate on account of the animosities between the two nations. These were all confined in four or five rooms crowded with hammocks three tier high; but they had a spacious airing ground, and the prison was situated on a fine eminence. There were thirty-six sick, in some small rooms of a house at a distance from the prison. These had no sheets; but - great attention seemed to be paid them by the surgeon, and they made no complaints. At the prison, the bedding wanted regulation. No table of rules or victualling was hung up, (1779) or ever had been. The prisoners rejoiced at the discharge of the lute agent; and from the character of the new agent, had every reason to expect all due attention and humanity. Their meat was fine and good; the beer good; the bread heavy. — Sep. 5, 1782, there v/ere twenty French, seven Spanish, and seven Dutch prisoners.

Here, as well as at all the other places throughout the kingdom where French prisoners were confined, I found that there was an allowance from the French court of one penny per day to all sailors and boys; two pence to boatswains, carpenters, &c. and three pence to those of superior rank; which was regularly paid them every month. There was besides a supply from the same court of clothes, linen, and shoes to those who were destitute of these articles:a noble and exemplary provision, much to the honour of those who conducted public affairs in France f

The prison in the fortress at Hull consists of several rooms, with two tier of shelves for the straw, or beds. There were only fifty-one Dutch prisoners, Jan. 30, 1782, many having been lately sent to Shrewftniry. These prisoners were sensible of the attention paid them by Mr. Kirman the surgeon and agent.

In the Castle at Lincoln, Feb. 1, 1782, I found eight Dutch prisoners, who had been taken ill on their march from Hull to Shrewsbury. One of them, an old man, died the next day; the rest recovered. Their allowance was six-pence a day, and they were kindly supplied from a collection made by Dr. Stinton, chancellor of Lincoln.

At Shrewsbury, in a large and elegant building on the bank of the Severn, called the orphan-house (as being erected in 1765 for the reception of children from the foundling-hospital at London), there were in June 1782, three hundred and thirty-

Rice milk, orange whey, orange and lemon water, tamarind whey, vinegar whey, balm and sage tea to be discretionally used by the surgeon.

+ I have since heard that a bounty was paid by the court of England to their prisoners in France, at the following rates, viz. captains, mates, failing masters, surgeons, and stewards, three pence per day each; common sailors, boys, and passengers of inferior rank, three halfpence per day each; which payment was made every twenty-eight days.

Sect. V. PRISONERS OF WAR. 191

eight Dutch prisoners; twenty-seven of them were in the hospital. The wards were spacious, a hundred and twenty feet by twenty. At the back of the prison there is a fine area of four acres well supplied with water, and at the hospital an area of one acre. The regulations in Dutch and French were hung up. The beds in the hospital were not crowded; all had sheets and the surgeon paid great attention to the patients.

Many of the prisoners were without shoes and {lockings, and some had no shirtsj for they had not received any bounty from the States, as the French and Spanish prisoners had from their courts. But by a generous subscription in the town promoted by the surgeon (/6i:15: 0), they were soon after supplied with necessary clothing. The Dutch government afterwards ordered an allowance.

At Yarmouth, July 8, 1782, there were ten French and ninety-two Dutch prisoners. Their rooms and court, and the three rooms of the infirmary, were too close. The regulations in French and Dutch were hung up. The provisions were good. The prisoners looked healthy and well: most of them had been brought in but a few days.

At Falmouth, Feb. 6, 1783, there were sixty-five French, twenty-four Spanish and nineteen Dutch prisoners; of whom, sixteen French, six Spanish and five Dutch were in the hospital. The prison was situated on a fine eminence about two miles from the town, and had plenty of water. The provisions were good, and the prisoners then made no complaint. — The hospital was above a mile from the prison. The patients lay single, in good cractes, hair-beds, sheets and coverlets. The wards were tiled, and were the more airy and salutary for not being ceiled.

All prisons and hospitals should be near towns, for the convenience of provisions being sent in regularly, and the attendance of surgeons and agents.

My principal object in procuring lists of the number of prisoners of war who had been received and had died in several prisons, was to refute a prevailing opinion of our severity and inattention to such prisoners. These lists, which I received from the agents, were afterwards checked by the books of the Commissioners of sick and wounded seamen In London, who readily granted me that favour.

I found in the castle at Edinburgh, July 6, 1779, sixty-four French prisoners, in two rooms formerly used as barracks for the soldiers. In one of the rooms they lay on straw, two and two, in boxes against the wall, with two coverlets to each box: in the other room they lay on mattresses in hammocks. — The regulations as to diet.

Their bread was excellent, and all other provisions good; nor was there any thing of which they made complaint. — They received every month, the allowance from the French court. — There were fourteen in the hospital, which was a house at some distance in the city, where they had bedding and sheets, and great attention was paid them by the humane surgeon and agent.

In the castle, March 27, 1782, there were fifteen American and fourteen French prisoners; and ten who were said to be Irish, who were closely confined, being out only one hour in a day. In such close confinement prisoners should always have one of the doors iron-latticed. — The bread was very good; the water in the well was brackish, the prisoners should have been permitted with a guard to fetch water every day from the city. — August 17, 1782, there were only five French prisoners.

ON the 13th of July 1779, there were seventy-seven French prisoners at Belfast, who had been brought there the beginning of May. — There was no table of regulations, and they seemed to be much neglected.

At Dublin, July 22, 1779, there were twenty-two prisoners of war, in a good room fitted up for a temporary prison. Their bread and other provisions were very good; and they were treated with all the Humanity and kindness that could be expected.

In the Old Newgate, May 28, 1782, there were thirty-two prisoners of war of several nations, being part of the crew of a Dunkirk privateer. They were confined in one large room. Allowance six-pence a day to each. These prisoners were soon after removed to Kilkenny.

At Kilkenny, June 9, 1782, there were a hundred and fifty-seven French*, three Spanish and five Dutch prisoners of war, besides eleven in the infirmary and seventeen French on their parole. They were all privateers men: they looked healthy and had no cause of complaint.

AMERICAN PRISONERS.

[Plymouth.]

[American Prisoners.]

In Mill-prison near Plymouth, there were two hundred and ninety-eight American prisoners on the 3d of February 1779. Their wards and court were spacious and convenient, and their bread, beer, and meat good. On July 30, 1782, there were only seven American prisoners.

[For ton.]

The Americans were equally well accommodated at For ton near Gosport, where I found two hundred and fifty-one prisoners, March 2, 1779.

The table of regulations was almost the same with that for the French prisoners. The principal difference was, that in the victualling table, the bread allowance was then only one pound a day. The meagre day was Saturday; and against the weekly article of two pints of pease, was added, or greens in lieu." The regulation. Art. 5. is well worth copying. "As water and tubs for washing their linen and cloaths, will be allowed, the prisoners are advised to keep their persons as clean as possible, it being very conducive to health."

[Pembroke.]

At Pembroke, June 5, 1779, there were confined in an old house thirty-seven American prisoners. Some of them were without shoes and stockings. - There was no victualling table, or table of regulations; nor did they know what was the allowance ordered by government. They lay on straw on the floor, and their straw had not been changed for six or seven weeks. — By liberal subscriptions, ample provision had been made for the other American prisoners: I was sorry to find that these had been entirely overlooked.

In a house appropriated for an hospital, in which were some English sailors and French prisoners, I found also three American prisoners, very poorly accommodated. — I should not omit mentioning that I found the American prisoners (except at Pembroke) clean and well clothed — the latter, not entirely from the generous supplies they have had from this country, but in conjunction with that from their own. — At my visits in 1782, the Americans were with the other prisoners of war, and had an allowance from the States; as I mentioned at For ton (page 187).

Before I leave this subject, it will be but justice to mention the care and assiduity of the Commissioners, who themselves visited many of the prisons in England, and dismissed such agents as had abused their trust; and who are ready to receive any information which may be for the benefit of those committed to their care.

Sect. VI. SCOTLAND. 195

Section VI.

SCOTCH and IRISH PRISONS.

IT may not be improper, before I enter on a particular account of English prisons, to mention what further occurred to me that seemed worthy of observation, in my journies into Scotland and Ireland in 1779, 1782 and, 1783.

[Scotland.]

The prisons that I saw in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, Stirling, Jedburgh, Haddington, Ayr, Kelso, Nairne, Bamff, Inverness, &c. were old buildings, dirty and offensive, without court-yards and also generally without water.

If a prisoner for debt declares upon oath that he has not wherewithal to maintain himself, the creditor must aliment him within ten days after notice is given for that purpose, with at least three pence a day*, but generally the magistrates order six-pence. — By the process of cessio bonorum†, a debtor after being a month in prison, may obtain his liberty, and be secured against execution for any previous debts, by making a surrender of all his effects to be divided among his creditors: though if he afterwards comes into better circumstances, his effects may be attached for the payment of those debts. This compassionate law prevents a creditor putting his debtor in prison, unless he has good reason to believe he is acting fraudulently.

Perjury is not frequent in Scotland. The oath, and the form of administering it, are very solemn. The witness, holding up his right hand, repeats the following words after the judge: — "By God himself, and as you shall answer to God at the great day of judgment, you shall declare the truth, and nothing but the truth, in so far as you know, or shall be asked at you." — The depositions are read over by the clerk, and signed by the witnesses and the judge‡. — It is enacted by the 20th of Geo. II. that "the circuit-courts shall be regularly held twice in every year, within that part of Great Britain, called Scotland, and the Judges thereof

[Scotland.]

"shall continue by the space of six days at least, at each town or place where the circuit-courts shall be held, for the dispatch of business*."

There are in Scotland but few prisoners; this is partly owing to the shame and disgrace annexed to imprisonment; partly to the solemn manner in which oaths are administered, and trials and executions conducted; and partly to the general sobriety of manners produced by the care which parents and ministers take to instruct the rising generation†.

---

I am indebted to Andrew Crosbie, Esq. for an account, from the clerk of the judiciary, of the executions from January 1768 to May 1782, which shall be inserted in a table at the end of the book; from ^hich it will appear, that in thirteen years and a half, there have been only fifty-four executed, and twenty-two pardoned.

In Scotland, executions formerly were not delayed after conviction or sentence such delays being often equally injurious to the criminal and to society. Here, the punishment of the offender was made to appear the immediate consequence of his crime‡.

* This good act is similar to one enacted for the counties of Wales in 34th and 35th of Henry VIII. Chap. XXVI. " That every of the said sessions shall be kept and continued by the space of six days in " every of the said shires, at either of the said times, as is and hath been used within the said three shires " of North Wales."

† It is provided by statute in the sixth session of king William's first parliament, 1696, Chap. XXVI.

That there be a school settled and established, and a schoolmaster appointed in every parish" in Scotland, and the presbytery has the superintendence of the execution of this act, which has been carefully-attended to Many schools are also settled by donations and legacies, and by the society for propagating christian knowledge; so that no pariflo is without a school, and in some there are four or five. In the southern parts of Scotland, it is very rare that you meet with any person that cannot both read and write. It is scandalous for any person not to be possessed of a Bible, which is always read in the parochial schools.

‡ By the act made in king William's first session, 169; , Chap. IV. all capital crimes are restricted to the trial and sentence within three Suns; and the " Execution, which is hereby left to the discretion of the Judge, not exceeding nine days after sentence." — The Statute of the nth of Geo. I. Chap. XXVI. enacts, that no sentence of death, or corporal punishment, can, on the south side of the Forth, be put in execution in less than thirty, and on the north, than forty days. This statute is altered in so far as respects punishments that amount neither to death nor demembration; and the law allows all such lesser corporal i punishments to be inflicted after eight days on the south side of the river Fcrtb, and twelve days on the north side of the river Forth. This alteration is made by the statute of the 3d of Geo. II. Chap. XXXII. which likewise empowers the court of judiciary to flay execution of such sentences pronounced in inferiour courts for thirty days, upon cause shewn, that such application may be made for redress as may be competent by the laws of Scotland. The statute of the nth of Geo. I. is referred entire by the statute of the 25th of Geo. II. Chap. XXXVII. which enacts, that murderers in England shall be executed within three days.

Sect. VI. SCOTLAND. 197

Scotland.

All criminals are tried out of irons: and when acquitted, they are immediately discharged in open court; and no gaoler has a fee from any criminal. — Women are not put in irons in Scotland.

In the Tolbooth at Edinburgh *, July 6, 1779, there were thirteen debtors and nine felons; and in the Canongate Tolbooth, there were five debtors and one felon: and in the house of correction there were fifty-three women, crowded into three dirty and

I here give the table of fees from the Tolbooth in this city, which is the only one I saw in the prisons in Scotland, except a similar one in the Canongate Tolbooth, and one at Glasgow.

Sect. VI. SCOTLAND. 199

[Edinburgh.]

Mr. Steuart was using his best endeavours to get a new gaol built, which should be subject to better regulations and stand in a more airy situation.

[Infirmary.]

I could not but admire the Royal Infirmary at Edinburgh. Few hospitals in England exceed it in airiness and cleanliness. Great attention is paid to the patients, and their complaints are very accurately minuted: the students attend the physician in his round of the wards. The success of this institution is evident, from the few that die in comparison with the number admitted. The proportion of deaths to the number admitted, from 1770 to 1775 inclusive, was as one to twenty-five nearly. In 1776 and 1777, the proportion was nearly as one to twenty-nine. The total number of patients admitted in 1780 was two thousand two hundred and twenty-eight, of whom seventy-six died: the number in 1781 was two thousand two hundred and six, of whom seventy-four died — Dr. John Hope, the first physician in this hospital (who lives very near it and gives unremitting attendance) informed me, that two or three years ago, a putrid fever prevailed in it; but that white-washing the walls had eradicated the insection, and that this salutary practice had been continued ever since*.

[Orphan-Hospital.]

The Orphan-hospital also deserves particular commendation, in which in 1782, there were about seventy boys and sixty girls, who appeared decently clothed, cheerful, clean and healthy. The girls are taught (besides reading and writing) spinning, knitting, sewing and houshold work; and the boys carding, spinning, knitting, mending their clothes, &c. All are educated in the principles of virtue and religion, and formed to such habits as may tend to make them good servants and apprentices. Every part of the house was clean. — The maintenance, &c. for each child, is about five pounds. — Mr. Tod, the treasurer, merits peculiar respect for the attention and zeal with which he endeavours to promote the usefulness and credit of this hospital -f.

[Glasgow.]

In the Tolbooth at Glasgow, July 9, 1779, there were thirteen debtors and seven criminals; and in the house of correction, seventeen women were spinning, decently clothed: in September 1782, there were eighteen debtors and five criminals in the Tolbooth and twenty-six prisoners in the house of correction.

Rules to be observed by the Jaylor and his servants.

1. The jaylor shall not by himself or any of his servants, directly or indirectly, demand or receive from any prisoner, or from any person in his or in her name, at entry, or during his or her confinement, any sums of money under the name of entry money, garnishing, or any other denomination, separate from and over and above the fees stipulated as above. Further, the jaylor shall not suffer any of the prisoners, to make demands of money or drink from persons newly incarcerated, on any pretence whatsoever.

2. The jaylor shall, from 1st of April to 1st of October, open each day the prison at eight, and shut it half an hour after nine in the morning; open it at eleven before noon, and shut it half an hour after two o'clock afternoon; open it at four o'clock afternoon, and shut it at ten o'clock at night. And from the 1st of October to the 1st of April, he shall open the prison each day at nine in the morning, and shut it half an hour after two o'clock afternoon; open it at four o'clock afternoon, and shut it at ten o'clock at night; only on Sundays, the prison shall be shut during publick worship, any thing in this rule to the contrary. And the jaylor is always to keep the whole keys of the prison in his own custody while it is shut up, and not entrust them with any of his servants,

3. The jaylor, every morning and evening, at the opening of, and before shutting up the prison, shall personally visit every room and place therein, carefully inspect the windows, chimnies, and walls thereof, in order to prevent and discover all attempts to cut the iron stanchers, or to break through the stone walls, joists, and floors of the prison, and he shall take particular care, that no instruments be conveyed to, or be in the possession of any of the prisoners, whereby they may effectuate their escape, or hurt one another; and in case the jaylor shall, through indisposition, be prevented from the execution of his duty, he shall take care to employ some faithful person in his absence.

4. The jaylor and his servants, are expressly prohibited, on any account, to sell, or suffer to be brought in to any of the prisoners, spirits, or strong liquor, whereby they may be in danger of being intoxicated; and to use their utmost endeavours to promote sobriety amongst those under their charge.

Sect. VI. SCOTLAND. 201

It would, perhaps, answer no end to give a description of all the Scotch prisons that I visited. I will, therefore, only add to this account the following particulars.

At Dumfries in the court-house is a room called the open gaol (sixteen feet three inches by eleven feet three) with closets and a fire-place, where a debtor that finds bail has the key, and may converse at the door. — The gaol in this town was burnt by a prisoner some years ago. To prevent this for the future, the rooms in it have been vaulted.

The like accident happened to the upper floor of the Tolbooth at Aberdeen, a neat and clean prison, the upper floor of which is now very properly arched over.

---

The Tolbooth at Inverness has no fire-place, and is the most dirty and offensive prison that I have seen in Scotland *. (The room for debtors is sixteen feet by fourteen and a half: that for felons about thirteen feet and a half square, and only six feet and a half high , the window is twenty inches by fix.)

In one of the piers of the stone-bridge at Inverness, there is a vaulted room intended for a prison. This room was constructed in 1684, when the bridge was built, but had not been opened for three years before my late visit. Near the wall of the bridge there is a trap-door twenty-two inches square, and a few steps down from it, an iron door (two feet three inches wide, and two feet and a half high), from which there is a descent of a- few steps more to the room just mentioned, which is ten feet four inches by seven feet fix, and six feet high. On the sides there are a stone feat, a small window, and two apertures to dip for water, &c.

5. The jaylor shall keep the prisoners for debt. In the bell rooms, and separate from criminals and disorderly persons, and prevent, as much as possible, their associating and conversing together, and the friends and servants of debtors, shall be allowed at all convenient times, to bring in vivers for their support.

6. In order to make the prison more healthy and clean, the jaylor shall, at his own expence, causepair and clean the (lairs, sweep the rooms, and remove and carry away all filth and nastiness, at lead, three times in the week.

7. The jaylor, in the event of his exafling, by himself, or his servants, more fees than (Updated as above, or in the event of transgressing any of the rules or instructions foresaid, shall be dismissed from his office, or otherwise punished as the magistrates, for the time being, and council shall judge proper.

It is recommended to the magistrates, frequently to examine and inquire into the fidelity of the jaylor and his servants; and the council hereby ordains these dues and regulations to be printed and published, that none may pretend ignorance; and ordains John Rowan jaylor, and his successors in office, to affix a copy hereof in the most public part of the Tolbooth, under the penalty of ten pounds Scots.

As this is the circuits-town for seven other counties (one third of Scotland), I hope the judges will recommend the erection of a new gaol. A regard to themselves requires this; for the offensive room in which the criminals are lodged, opens into the court. — Part of the forfeited ellates might be appropriated to that purpose.

The following defeats may be remarked in the prisons in Scotland.

They have no courts belonging to them*j generally want water and fewersj — -are not clean; — they are not visited by the magistrates; — too little attention is paid to the reparation of the sexes; — the keepers are allowed licences for the sale of the most pernicious liquors; the consequence of which is, that the county allowance being paid in money to the prisoners, they generally spend it in whiskey instead of bread.

" We do not think it possible, that a nation can attain to improvement in science, " to refinement of taste, and in manners, without, at the same time, acquiring a " refinement in their ideas of justice, and feelings of humanity f."

IRELAND.

I was happy in finding at Dublin in 1779, a New Prison almost ready for the removal of the prisoners into more airy and convenient apartments, in which I hoped the shocking intercourse of the two sexes which took place in the old prison, would be avoided. This new prison is one hundred and seventy feet in length, and has separate courts for men and women. The cells on the first and second floors are about twelve feet by eight, and on the upper floor twelve by four, all arched with brick, to prevent danger from fire ||. I was sorry to find dungeons, and wished they might never be used, except at night for the condemned. It might be belt to convert the chapel at the top of the house into an infirmary; for the sick rooms are too small, and likely to produce infection.

The original cause of this seems to have been the following very severe maxim in the Scotch law. e‘ After a debtor is imprisoned, he ought not to be indulged the benefit of the air, not even under a guard.; " for creditors have an interest, that their debtors be kept under close confinement, that, by the squalor " carcerts, they may be brought to pay their debt."

X I have frequently referred, in the early parts of this work, to the Irish acts of parliament for the regulation of prisons, as containing many articles highly laudable and worthy of imitation. I am sorry, however, that it is necessary for me to say, that the police of this country in these matters is as defective in point of execution, as it is commendable in, theory.

1| It would have been much better if the same precaution had been used in London Newgate.

IRELAND. 203

In the two courts there are pumps. Great attention should be paid to air and clean-liness in the staircases, cells and vaults, and in the narrow passages, to prevent them from becoming offensive and infectious*. I well remember the dreadful state of Dublin Newgate in the beginning of the year 1775, when I saw numbers of poor creatures ill with the gaol-fever, unattended and disregarded.

The criminals in the gaols of Ireland are very numerous. One reason of this may be, that in this country there are no houses of correction, unless cages could be called so, in which drunken or riotous persons are locked up for a night or twos. Another reason is, that acquitted persons are continued in confinement tiil they have discharged their fees to the clerk of the crown, or peace, the sheriff, gaoler and turnkey J. Even boys almost naked, and under the age of twelve, are sometimes confined a year or two for these fees, though amounting to no more than about forty shillings ]|. How surprising is it, that any kingdom can endure such injustice ! It is a particular aggravation of it, that the prisoners thus confined, generally lose, at the same time, their allowance of bread §. I have heard that Judge Aston (who was

The passages are three feet and a half wide, and the staircases only two feet one inch.

f It may be an exception, that in a house adjoining to old Newgate called the black dog, there were several fines. See. and that in another house (a fort of bridewell adjoining to the work-house in Dublin) I found in 1779 eleven young creatures; some of these for small offences were confined with outrageous lunatics. The magistrates seem to have overlooked a compassionate direction in an act of their legislature (fee 3d of Geo. III. Chap. XXVIII.) " that persons of insane mind and outrageous behaviour" are not to go in common with the other prisoners.

I There is an act for discharging without fees, persons who shall be acquitted " of offences for which " they are or shall be indisted, and for making a compensation to sheriffs, gaolers, clerks of the crown, " and clerks of the peace, for such fees," by a presentment on the respective counties. But many that are acquitted receive no benefit by it, because the presentment must be made by the foreman of the petty jury to the grand jury, and confirmed by the Judges of assize; and also the sum presented at one assize must not exceed '* ten pounds if it be a county at large; " or " five pounds if it be a county of a city or county of a town." 3d Geo.

§ Since writing the above, by an act of 21st and 2 2d of Geo. III. for revising, continuing and amending several temporary statutes, it has been enacted (page 827) that every person confined or to be confined in " any of his majesty's gaols within this kingdom, charged with any criminal offence, shall be intitled to " receive the prisoners allowance of bread, during the time of his or her said confinement; and if such person " shall, after having been tried for such offence and acquitted thereof, be confined for his or her fees, every " such person so confined shall be in like manner intitled to the like allowance." — This however being the last clause in the act, has escaped the attention, as Sir Francis Hutchinson justly observed to me, of the compiler of the small gaol-code.

here Lord chief justice of the common pleas) often ordered the acquitted prisoners to be discharged. In 1779 I obtained the release of some boys from the county gaol at Kilmainham, on paying for them half fees; and of some others from Newgate, the sheriffs of Dublin consenting to relinquish their fees. But as those boys had been associated with the most profligate and abandoned felons for many months, I did not in the lead: wonder to find that some of them returned to their former habitation in a few days. — In 1783 the deputy keeper of the new prison gave me a list of sixteen detained for their fees. At Kilmainham also I found there were fifteen acquitted prisoners confined for their fees in the dungeons. At both these prisons I restored to their families several who seemed the most proper objects of compassion. Some had children dying with the small-pox, others had hardly rags to cover them. But this distress had no more effect on the clerk of the crown, sheriffs and gaolers, than to engage them to give up half their fees.

In 1782, a bill was brought in by Mr. Pro void Hutchinson*, which passed into an act for discharging all those who were then in confinement for fees only (21st and 22d of George III. Chap. XLI.) I have every reason to hope, from the attention and humanity of this gentleman, that during the present session, a perpetual act for the same purpose will be passed.

On passing the old prison frequently, I could not avoid observing officers from the recruiting regiments waiting at the doors and windows, to receive either the offenders who were permitted to enlist, or any of their associates. When the excessive profligacy and daring wickedness of this set of people is considered, the most melancholy apprehensions must be entertained, of the dreadful consequences likely to result from their mixture with those who may have had a sober education, and have entered voluntarily into the service of their country f; and likewise of the danger to society in general, from turning loose such a set of wretches at the close of a war.

Our English prisons have also contributed their share towards recruiting the army, enlisting being the condition on which many have obtained their release from confinement, or immunity from some other punishment. I shall make no farther remark on this practice, but that if it be a necessary one, the legislature may receive some satisfaction from the effects of their late salutary laws respecting the health of prisoners. If this mode had been adopted while prisons were in their former state, it would have been the occasion of carrying the most fatal diseases into the midst of our seamen and soldiers.

I shall always reflect with pleasure on the unexpected honour which at this time was done me by the College, by presenting me with the degree of Doctor of Laws.

f These dreadful consequences have followed in a new raised regiment, which I saw in Scotland in

IRELAND. 205

There is a new Marshalsea prison in Dublin. The first stone was laid, as appears by the inscription, July 3, 1775. — At my visit in 1779, here were about sixty prisoners — In the city Marshalsea, which is a very old building, there were fifty-five debtors. Many debtors in this and the other prisons, being not alimented, are objects of compassion. But some of them are relieved by the care of a humane society at Dublin, similar to that called the 5Vhatched-House Society in London. — Such societies deserve the highest praise. — I wish however to recommend to compassion other prisoners (whose miseries have been long hid from the eyes of the public) who, though they seem to deserve assistance less, yet need it more, to save them from the ruin to which the bad state of the prisons exposes them.

I observed with pleasure, the progressive improvements in the llouse of Industry. At my last visits, the house, infirmary, and cells for the lunatics were quite clean, and the numerous inhabitants quiet and orderly; which is chiefly owing to the daily inspection of the governors in rotation. In the year which ended March 25, 1782, there came in voluntarily two thousand eight hundred and nineteen; and four hundred and sixty were compelled. August 2, 1783, the number was one thousand four hundred and forty.

There is an Irish act for preserving the health of prisoners, passed in the 17th and 18th of George III. Chap. XXVIII. similar to the English act for the same purpose. But I did not find it in any of the prisons. — There is another act of the same year, which is similar to the English act, for the punishment, by hard labour, of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported." But the hulks on the 'Thames having cruelly destroyed many healthy and robust young men, their cries probably reached the Irish shore, and prevented any proceedings in consequence of that act.

In 1782, I found that the House of Commons had taken into consideration that part of the police which respects prisons, and had appointed a gaol-committee for

In one of the insolvent acts in Ireland (11th George IT. Chap. XVI. p. 986) I found a singular clause, which I wish had been inserted in some of our late insolvent acts; to compel debtors, instead of continuing in prison, and spending their substance there, " to discover, and deliver up to their creditors, their estate and effects, in order to the satisfaction of their just debts."

of This differs from the English,ad in one important circumstance. The English act requires " the walls " and cielings of the several cells and wards, both of the debtors and the felons, and also of any other rooms " used by the prisoners in their respective gaols and prisons, 'where felons are usually confned, to be scraped " and white-washed, once in the year at least, to be regularly washed and kept clean, &c." whereas the Irish ad requires the same precautions in the cells, wards, and rooms of gaols and prisons without restriction; for the clause " where felons are usually confned" is omitted. — I have known it pleaded as an excuse for not white-washing and keeping clean the prisons in England where only debtors or petty offenders have been confined, that, they were not obliged to it by the act of parliament.

this purpose.' To this Committee I reported the state of several of the prisons in Dublin*.

I carefully inspected the gaols in Dublin in 1783. The following remarks on the New Prison I think particularly worth mentioning. It is not kept clean — The pumps being out of order there is no regular supply of water — There is no proper reparation of the fcxes from one another — or of petty offenders from the most abandoned criminals — Numbers of acquitted prisoners are detained for the fees — Such as are committed to hard labour are confined in idleness — There is no bedding, though the floors are done — Spirituous liquors are sold in the prison j- — New comers are robbed, or dripped and abused for the penny-pot or garnish £ — The proper prisoners have not the use of the day-rooms § — The dungeons are used as lodging-rooms for prisoners before they

J[ In the city bridewell there were also sixteen lunatics. No physician or apothecary has attended in this house for two or thrw years.

t A noggin or gill of that pernicious and destructive liquor 'whiskey, is sold in Dublin so cheap as three halfpence or two pence, and half a pint for three pence or four pence. This makes it the common liquor of prisoners and of the lower class of people, who are often intoxicated by it almost to madness.

J Garnish is three shillings and nine pence halfpenny Irish, several of those whom I had released gave the same account of it.

§ The day-room on the women's side was always shut up. At my last visit the condemned criminals were in the men's day-room; and the women's day-room was kept locked, for two or three felons who lodged in the deputy keeper's rooms to play in at tennis and other diversions.

To this gaol there are ample appointments. But such appointments can be of little consequence, while the sheriffs and magistrates neglect their duty, and seldom or never inspect the gaols or punish defaulters. — Are not such magistrates inexcusably guilty ? — Should they not be considered as accessary to the crimes and abuses and miseries occasioned by their neglect

Most of the remarks now made on this gaol at Dublin, are applicable to many of the county gaols.

I enumerate these particulars, not with a view of aggravating the idea of inattention to these objects in Ireland, or making a comparison between their management, and that in this country (which is JliU greatly defeElive) but with a view of inciting the public-spirited Irish gentlemen, now occupied on this subject, to set an example of a thorough and effectual reform, which may be imitated by this nation.

By an act of 2 ift and 22d of Geo. III. all judges, from and after the 24th of June 1783, are required to give in charge to the grand juries the two acts, one for the better preventing the severities and unjust exactions practised by gaolers against their prisoners, &c. (3d Geo. III.) the other for preserving the health of prisoners in gaol, &c. (17th and 18th Geo. III.) and the judges are further required to examine into the state and situation of the different gaols, and the condu6t of the gaolers, and to impose a fine on

Two of the committee of the House of Commons in June 1782 accompanied me to the new prison, and examined some of the sick who lay on the stone-floors totally neglected. Dr. Cleghera and Dr. Scots have been since ordered by the grand jury to attend them; but no bedding, no alteration of diet, and no nurses are ordered for them. — I was sorry to find in 1783, that the former ingenious young physician had died of the gaol-fever.

f The only building designed for a bath which I saw in the gaols in Ireland, was in the court yard at Trim, June 17, 1782. I looked Into it, and found it was the gaoler's pig-lty.

the county not exceeding five hundred pounds for neglect of repairing and enlarging such gaols. — Lord Temple, Lord Lieutenant in 1782, whose spirited and patriotic exertions in Ireland will be long remembered there, ordered the sheriffs to report the Rate of the county gaols, directing at the same time the (fix) acts relative to prisons*to be sent to every sheriff. His lordship also introduced a new mode of execution at the New-prison and Kilmainham. The criminals come out of a front window on a scaffold, which falling down, they are left hanging.

Having taken notice of several of the orphan-schools abroad, I cannot help adding an account of some particulars relating to the Protestant Charter-Schools.

Their number is forty-one, besides four nurseries to supply them with children. In visiting them I carried with me a sermon preached before the incorporated society, (to which is added an account of the several schools) published in 1781, at the request of the society. In the two schools near Dublin, that at Clontarf-Strand for boys, and at Santry for girls, I was greatly surprised to find but forty-six in the farmer, and thirty-four in the latter, though the numbers given in the published account were a hundred boys and forty girls. At Kilkenny and Castledermot the deficient numbers were twenty-six in the former, and seventeen in the latter; and there was a like deficiency in some of the other schools. These schools are managed by a committee of fifteen, who meet every week in Dublin f. This committee has lately discovered a consciousness of their error in publishing such false accounts, and suffering them to be delivered from the pulpit; for in the last ephemeris the true numbers seem to be given; and they amount to about seven hundred (or near a third) less than the numbers which had been before stated.

The masters of these schools hold a certain quantity of land belonging to the society, for which they pay no higher rent than was paid when the ground was originally granted. Every matter is allowed a salary of £12 Irish; and contracts for the clothing, diet, and work of the children. These contracts are so low (viz. annual clothing /1; 5; o Irish; diet £3: 2: 6) that the state of most of the schools which I visited was so deplorable, as to disgrace protestantism and encourage popery in Ireland, rather than the contrary.

If the committee finds a decrease in their funds, a less number of these schools with proper attention, will do the society much more credit than a large number of such frckly, naked and half starved children as I found in them. In short; these schools demand a thorough parliamentary inquiry.
---
May I be allowed to hint, that there should be one plain decent uniform for all the children — Distinct schools for each sex — Clean linen twice a week — A convenient

† There is besides a local committee for superintending each school.

Sect. VI. IRELAND. 209

---

bath — A larger allowance to the masters* for diet, and for walking, fire and caidles — A crib bedstead for each child — Rooms appropriated to the sick, and an apothecary for each house — Didinft school-rooms, work-rooms and dining-rooms, and an area enclosed for play — A dairy and pantry — The master's and millrefs's bed-room situated so as to look into the children's dormitory — The provincial nurseries abolished, and that at Dublin put on a larger plan (since if proper attention were paid to the children, the admission of a child would be a matter of favour and intreaty j-) — That a check should be kept on the local committees by the occasional inspection of one of the committee of fifteen, whose travelling expences might be paid by the society — That the rules and orders for every department should be conspicuously hung up — That premiums and every encouragement should be given to the most cleanly and diligent children — And the houses lime-whitened once a year.

I beg leave further to fugged, that it seems highly de fir able that these schools should be in the vicinity of large towns; both for a more easy supply of provisions, medical assistance, &c; and, more particularly, for the convenience of frequent visits from the local committees, without whose unremitting attention to enforce the prescribed rules> all the endeavours of the gentlemen in Dublin will be absolutely fruitless. I have generally found that in schools so situated, more attention has been paid to the children by the persons concerned in their education, than in those at some miles distance.

[Dublin Hospitals.]

Many of the hospitals in Dublin may be viewed with pleasure. In the Blue-coat Hospital, the boys looked healthy and cheerful. Stephens's, Simpson's, St. Patrick's and the Infirmary at the Foundling Hospital, were some of the cleaned. The governors of Mercer's Hospital have lately adopted a new and salutary contrivance. One pane in each of the upper sashes is taken out, and its place supplied by a fine wire lattice painted green; which rendered all the wards (at my visit in 1783) fresher and more agreeable than those in any other hospital in the city, though this is situated in the closed part of it. Before I quit the subject, I shall take the liberty to speak a word in favour of the Military, who are crowded in their Hospital (which is an old and incommodious building) into a kind of enclosed cases, swarming with vermin; and are almod stifled, most of the windows being fastened down.

---

* In the Account of the Highland Schools in Scotland, page 26, it is said, "in fact the insufficiency of the school-masters salaries has been found to be one great source of irregularities. — For these reasons, and considering the advanced price of provisions in every part of the country, as well as the importance of placing their school-masters in a situation above want, the society anxiously wish that every school-master in their service shall have their yearly salary increased."

† I was not at the nursery at Monivae in Connaught; but I saw several children lately sent from thence, who were distempered, half naked objects. I was further confirmed in my opinion of the inutility of the provincial nurseries, on being informed at one of the best schools, that near Waterford, (which had its full number of boys) that there was no difficulty in replenishing it from the neighbourhood, since parents frequently requested to have their children taken in.

210 ENGLISH PRISONS.

SECTION VII.

A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF

ENGLISH PRISONS.

AS the Tables of which the present Section will chiefly consist, contain several terms which cannot be familiar to the generality of my readers, I shall begin with an explanation of them.

In the first page of every county, city, &c. the second article of the Gaoler or keeper's emolument is Fees; by which are meant such only as are taken by him and his servants on the admission or discharge of a prisoner. The sums set down against this article are from the belt information I could procure in my repeated journies; but they differ sometimes from those specified in the tables of fees, where such are found.

The next article under gaoler is Transports, The sum set down to this, is what (from the best intelligence I could gain) I found was allowed them for conveying convicts sentenced to transportation to the respective sea-ports; and for paying the merchant or contractor what he was supposed to demand for their passage: although by the statutes 4th George I. and 8th of his present Majesty, it is enacted that "The person or persons so contracting — shall have a property and interest in the service of the said offenders for such terms of years."

With respect to the following article, Licence, I shall observe that in some places, as at Warwick, Oxford, Worcester, Exeter, Chester city, Yarmouth, Colchester, Carlisle, Montgomery, Monmouth, Ufk, &c. the gaoler has no licence, and yet is permitted, by connivance, to sell beer, and some gaolers even wine to the prisoners, and their visiters. In these cases I have made no distinction.

Under Prisoners in the same page, the number which I found in the respective county-gaols on my different visits is distinguished into debtors and felons &c. The &c. is meant to include two kinds of prisoners chiefly; viz. fines and petty offenders. By fines are understood such as are detained till they pay a sum of money, a fine: — such as are obliged to find security for good behaviour: — and such as are committed for a limited term to mere confinement, or (which is much the same) to hard labour. Of these latter some have been previously whipped, or burnt in the hand. — The petty offenders are such as are sent to gaols instead of bridewells, for reasons mentioned in a former section. These also in some gaols are called fines. Besides these there are sometimes a few deserters, which I have generally mentioned.

Sect. VII. ENGLISH PRISONS. 211

---

Wherever there were tables of fees, I thought myself obliged to give exact and literal copies of them: I am not therefore answerable for the improprieties of expression, or defeats of form to be found in some of them: but to prevent tiresome and useless repetitions, I have abridged the formalities of preamble and conclusion. For the same reason, I have used the same liberty, with regard to the rules and orders of the few prisons that have such; as I have done likewise by the lists of benefactions and legacies. Where no mention is made of rules, &c. it may be concluded, that there are none hung up in that prison. Where there is no table of fees, I commonly note the defect*.

I have described no prison but from my own examination at the several dates set down before the number of prisoners. At each visit I entered every room, cell, and dungeon with a memorandum book in my hand, in which I noted particulars upon the spot. My description will to some readers appear too minute; but I chose rather to relate circumstances, than to characterize in general terms. By these, the legislature will be better acquainted with the real state of gaols; and magistrates will, be able to judge whether the prisons over which they preside, and to which they commit offenders, be fit for the purposes they are designed to answer. I might add, that a variety of descriptions may possibly suggest something useful in the plans of such prisons as may hereafter be erected; since whatever may appear worth copying may be extracted from any f.

I have here and there taken the liberty of pointing out what seemed to me, as I viewed a prison, an obvious remedy of some defect that happened to strike me. But I did not examine with the accuracy of a surveyor; and hope I shall not be thought to direct in the style of a dictator.

As in my first edition, I mentioned, that the state of some of our prisons was so much altered for the better, that an idea could scarcely be formed of the condition they had been in a few years ago; so I have now the additional satisfaction to remark, that the humanity and attention of the magistrates in some counties, have enabled me in this edition to erase the notes of censure respecting the management of gaols as to cleanliness, aliment, bedding, and the like, which I thought it my duty before to insert.

It should be observed, that by the statute 32d George II. if any gaoler, or keeper, demand fees not set down in a table signed by the justices, and afterwards confirmed by the judge or judges of assize, and justices, and hung up conspicuous in the prison; such demand is illegal, and the offender is liable to a penalty of fifty pounds to the person injured.

* My minuteness with respect to measurements and other circumstances relative to the construction and government of these buildings, will require no apology with those, who consider, that in the formation of new establishments it is of use to be acquainted with many things which, though apparently trivial, are frequently of material consequence to the purposes intended to be answered.*

Tower.

THE TOWER.

The Tower is a strong fortress, and the only prison in England for state -delinquents of rank. The care of it is committed to an officer called the Constable of the Tower, who has under him a lieutenant, a deputy-lieutenant called the governor, and many other officers, among whom are forty warders3 whose uniform is the same with the king's yeomen of the guards. Nineteen of these warders have separate houses well furnished, in any of which, as the governor is pleased to order, the state-delinquents may be confined; and the custom has been to assign them two of the best rooms on the first floor: then, iron bars are fixed to their windows by the board of works. Sometimes they are committed to cloje confinement; but in general they are at liberty to walk in the area of the tower, attended always with a warder.

There had been no prisoners here for several years before my visit in 1779; and when there are any, they are soon brought to a legal trial, and consequently their confinement can never be long. Six shillings and eight pence a day are allowed by government for their subsistence; but they seldom accept this allowance.

September 1, 1783, there were no prisoners. Mr. Laurens was the last, who went out December 31, 1781.

In this Fortress, besides the houses just mentioned, there are several public offices and store-houses; such, particularly, as the office of Ordnance, the Jewel-office, the Mint, and buildings for holding artillery and artps.

THE builders of Old Newgate seem to have regarded in their plan, nothing but the single article of keeping prisoners in safe custody. The rooms and cells were so close, as to be almost the constant feats of disease, and sources of insection; to the destruction of multitudes, not only in the prison, but abroad. The city had therefore very good reason for their resolution to build a new gaol. The plate will give a better idea of it than any description. I give the plan, rather to satisfy the curiosity of my readers, than as a model to be followed. Many inconveniences of the old gaol are avoided in this new one: but it has some manifest errors. It is now too late to point out particulars. All I will say, is, that without more than ordinary care, the prisoners in it will be in great danger of the gaol-fever.

The

Newgate.

[Remarks.]

LONDON.

Newgate.

The cells built in Old Newgate a few years since for condemned malefactors, are still used for the same purpose. I Hi all therefore give some account of them. There are upon each of the three floors five; all vaulted, near 9 feet high to the crown. Those on the ground-floor measure full 9 feet by near 6; the five on the first story are a little larger (9! by 6) on account of the set-off in the wall} and the five uppermost, still a little larger for the same reason. In the upper part of each cell, is a window double grated, near 3 feet by i-|. The doors are inches thick. The strong (tone wall is lined all round each cell with planks, studded with broad-headed nails. In each cell is a barrack-bedstead. I was told by those who attended them, that criminals who had affected an air of boldness during their trial, and appeared quite unconcerned at the pronouncing sentence upon them, were struck with horror, and shed tears, when brought to these darksome solitary abodes.

The chapel is plain and neat. Below is the chaplain's feat, and three or four pews for the felons} that in the centre is for the condemned. On each side is a gallery: that for the women is towards their ward: in it is a pew for the keeper, whose presence may set a good example, and be otherwise useful. The other gallery towards the debtors ward is for them. The stairs to each gallery are on the outside of the chapel. I attended there several times, and Mr. Villette read the prayers distinctly, and with propriety: the prisoners who were present, seemed attentive; but we were disturbed by the noise in the court. Surely they who will not go to chapel, who are by far the greater number, should be locked up in their rooms during the time of divine service, and not suffered to hinder the edification of such as are better disposed.

The Chaplain (or ordinary) besides his salary, has a house in Newgate-street, clear of land-tax} lady Barnadifton's legacy, /6 a year; an old legacy paid by the governors of St. Bartholomew's hospital, £10 a year; and lately had two freedoms yearly, which commonly sold for £25 each} and the city generally presented him once in six months with another freedom. Now he has not the freedoms, but his salary is augmented to £180, and the sheriffs pay him £2 ' 12: 0. He engages when chosen to hold no other living.

Debtors have every Saturday from the chamber of London eight stone of beef: fines four stone: and some years felons eight stone. Debtors have, several legacies. I inquired for a list of them, and Mr. Akerman told me the table in Maitland's Survey was authentic. The amount of it is £52: 5: 8 a year. There are other donations mentioned by Maitland, amounting to sixty-four stone of beef, and five dozen of bread*.

After the riots in 1780 the debtors were confined in Clerkenwell bridewell, and the New-Prison: but at my last visit they were in Newgate.

To these he adds the donation of " Robert Dow, who left £1: 6: 8 yearly for ever " to the sexton or bellman of St. Sepulchre's, to pronounce solemnly two exhortations to " the persons condemned, the night before their execution , in these words

c< You prisoners who are within " Who for wickedness and fin,

" after many mercies shewn you, are now appointed to die tomorrow in the forenoon, " give ear and understand that tomorrow morning the greatest bell of St. Sepulchre's " shall toll for you in form and manner of a passing bell as used to be tolled for " those that are at the point of death, to the end that all godly people may pray, " &c. &c

Here I cannot forbear mentioning a practice which probably had its origin from the ancient mode of torture, though now it seems only a matter of form. When prisoners capitally convicted at the Old Bailey are brought up to receive sentence, and the judge asks, "What have you to lay why judgment of death and execution should not be awarded against you," the executioner flips a whipcord noose about their thumbs. — This custom ought to be abolished.

At my visit in 1779, l^e ga°l was clean, and free from of Tenfive scents. On the felons side, there were only three sick, in one of the upper wards. — An infirmary was building near the condemned cells. Of the 141 felons &c. there were 91 convicts and fines, who had only the prison allowance of a penny loaf a day: Mr. Aizerman generously contributed towards their relief. In the felons court, the table of fees painted on a board was hung up.

This gaol was burnt by the rioters in 1780, but is rebuilt on the same plan. The men's quadrangle is now divided into three courts. In the first court, are those who pay three shillings and six-pence a week for a bed; in the next, the poorer felons; and in the other, now the women. — Under the chapel, are cells for the refractory. Two rooms, adjoining to the condemned cells, are built for an infirmary, in one of which at my last visit there were sixteen sick. Of the two hundred and ninety-one prisoners in 1782, two hundred and twenty-five were men, and sixty-flx women. Upwards of an hundred of them were transports, eighty-nine fines, twenty-one under sentence of death, and the remainder lay for trial. Some of the condemned had been long sick and lan~-guishing in their cells j\

Maitland's Hijlory of London, vol. I. p. 26. edit. 1760.

f At the end of the book, I shall give a table of all the executions for London and Middlesex, during twelve years pall.

An execution day is too much, with us, a day of riot and idleness, and it is found by experience, that the minds of the populace are rather hardened by the spechtele, than affected in any salutary manner. Might not these evils be amended by having the reportwithin a week after sentence, and the execution, soon after, either in the area before Newgate, or before the sessions-house

Since the above was written, I learn with satisfaction that, the place of execution is altered according to the foregoing idea.

TO this prison were committed formerly those who incurred the displeasure of Remarks, the Star-chamber. In the 16th of Charles I. when that court was abolished, it became a prison for debtors; and for persons charged with contempts of the courts of chancery, exchequer, and common pleas.

In 1728, many abuses practised by the warden were the subject of parliamentary inquiry.

The prison was rebuilt a few years since. At the front is a narrow court. At each end of the building, there is a small projection, or wing. There are four floors, they call them galleries, besides the cellar-floor, called Bartholomew-Fair. Each gallery consists of a passage in the middle, the whole length of the prison, 66 yards; and rooms on each side of it about 14 % feetby'i2-|, and 94 high. A chimndy and window in every room. The passages are narrow (not seven feet wide) and darkish, having only a window at each end. — On the first floor, the hall-gallery, to which you ascend by eight steps, are, a chapel, a tap-room, a coffee-room (made out of two

LONDON.

[Fleet.]

rooms for debtors), a room for the turnkey, another for the watchman, and eighteen rooms for prisoners. — Besides the coffee-room and tap-room, two of those eighteen rooms, and all the cellar-floor, except a lock-up room to confine the disorderly, and another room for the turnkey, were held by the tapfier, John Cartwright, who bought the remainder of the lease at public auction in 1775. The cellar-floor is sixteen steps below the hall-gallery. It consists of the two rooms just now mentioned, the tapster's kitchen, his four large beer and wine cellars, and fifteen rooms for prisoners. These fifteen, and the two before-mentioned on the hall-gallery, the tapster lets to prisoners for from four to eight shillings a week*.

On the first gallery (that next above the hall-gallery) are twenty-five rooms for prisoners. On the second gallery twenty-seven: one of them, fronting the staircase, is their committee-room. A room at one end is an infirmary. At the other end, in a large room over the chapel, is a dirty billiard-table; kept by the prisoner who sleeps in that room. On the highest story are twenty-seven rooms. Some of these upper rooms, viz. those in the wings, are larger than the rest; being over the chapel, the tap-room, &c. All the rooms I have mentioned are for master's-side debtors. The weekly rent of those not held by the tapster is is. $d. unfurnished. They fall to the prisoners in succession, thus: when a room becomes vacant, the first prisoner upon the list of such as have paid their entrance-fees, takes possession of it. When the prison was built, the warden gave each prisoner his choice of a room according to his seniority as prisoner. If all the rooms be occupied, a new comer must hire of some tenant a part of his room; or ftiift as he can. Prisoners are excluded from all right of succession to the rooms held by the tapster, and let at the high rents aforesaid. — The apartments for common-side debtors are only part of the right wing of the prison. Besides the cellar (which was intended for their kitchen, but is occupied with lumber, and shut up) there are four floors. On each floor is a room about 24 or 25 feet square, with a fire-place; and on the sides, seven closets or cabins to lleep in Such of these prisoners as swear in court or before a commissioner that they are not worth five pounds, and cannot subsist without charity, have the donations which are sent to the prison, the begging-box, and the grate. Of them there were at one of my viiits sixteen, at some other times not so many.

I have in the Report of the Committee of the House of Commons 1728, a table of some charities: but no such table was hung up in the prison -f\

An imposition of the same kind noted in the Report of the Gaol-Committee, March 20, 1728. p. 8.

+ It was ordered by the Judges Eyre, Price, Page and Denton: " that a table of gifts and bequests 0 made for the prisoners in the Fleet, expressing the particular purposes for which the same were given, " be prepared by the warden, and hung up in the hall of the said prison." See Table of Fees, Trinity term 1727, in the Report of the Gaol-Committee, page l6.

Sect. VII. LONDON.

There is plenty of water from the river and pumps; and a spacious court behind the prison.

I mentioned the billiard-table. They also play in the court-yard at {kittles, miflifippi, fives, tennis, &c. And not only the prisoners: I saw among them several butchers and others from the market; who are admitted here as at another public house. — -The same may be seen in many other prisons where the gaoler keeps or lets the tap. Besides the inconvenience of this to prisoners; the frequenting a prison lessens the dread of being confined in one. On Monday night there was a wine-club: on Thursday night a beer-club: each lading usually till one or two in the morning. I need not say how much riot these occasion; and how the sober prisoners, and those that are sick, are annoyed by them.

Seeing the prison crowded with women and children, I procured an accurate lid of them; and found that on (or about) the 6th of April 1776, when there were on the mader's-side 213 prisoners, on the common-side 30, total 243; their wives (including women of an appellation not so honourable) and children were 475.

I was surprised to see in this prison, a table of fees containing only those of the clerks of the papers and inquiries; and that the date of it was 1727, /. e. before the Committee of the House of Commons made their inquiry. I did not doubt but another table was settled after that inquiry; and that it contained the warden's fees also. But upon a iking the clerk of the papers for a later table, I was referred to that which hung up. It is as follows.

There was, moreover, a little code of laws, eighteen in number, enacted by the mafier's-side debtors, and printed by D. Jones 1774. It established a president, a secretary, and a committee, which was to be chosen every month, and to consist of three members from each gallery. These were to meet in the committee-room every Thursday: and at other times when Summoned by the cryer, at command of the president, or of a majority of their own number. They were to raise contributions by assessment: to hear complaints: determine disputes: levy fines; and seize goods for payment.

The above was the account of the Fleet before it was burnt by the rioters in 1780. It is rebuilt on the same plan. The floors of the cellar, the hall, and the first story are now stone, and arched with brick. The tapster still has all the cellar-floor. He and several of the prisoners keep dogs, which nuisance should never be permitted in prisons. The billiard and mifiiflppi tables are put down, and the little code of laws abolished. — In 1783, from July 7, to Aug. 25, not one prisoner was brought in — Robert Baflan, a crown prisoner, was committed Nov. 29, 1776, and after the fire surrendered himself under the proclamation Nov. 17, 1781, and was here at my last visit.

IN BISHOPGATE-STREET.

Remarks. Th I s prison for debtors who are free of the city, for clergymen, proctors and attorneys, was formerly a bridewell to the London work-house adjoining.

On the ground-floor are, a long-room, a tap-room, and a kitchen. In each of them is a staircase , leading first to eleven rooms for master-side debtors — viz. over the long-room, a sizeable chamber, and a room on each of the two floors above: over the tap-room, four small rooms, which have iron bars at the windows, and a larger room above them: over the kitchen, a sizeable chamber, and two rooms above. The common-side debtors are in two large garrets, the Forest and Dock, which have no fire-places. — The prison is out of repair, the walls and ceilings very black, being never white-waftred. A small court, with a cistern for river-water which is not from the main. No infirmary: no bath. The chapel is common to the prison and work-house. Chaplain, Rev. Mr. Henry Foulkes, now Mr. Rose.

---

The city allowance is ten stone of beef a week: to which has been added since the 9th of February 1776, a twopenny loaf every other day for each prisoner (weight Aug. 1783, 21oz.). The lord mayor and sheriffs send annually coals: and Messrs. Calvert and Co. formerly sent from the Peacock brewhouse weekly a generous donation of two barrels of small beer. Keeper's salary, £70: fees, see table. He lives distant; but the deputy is careful in his attendance.

I always found this prison clean. The tap is shut at ten every night. On Sunday, a board is placed at the gate, on which is painted, "No admittance from 10 o'clock to 12, nor from 2 till 4."

FOR master's-side debtors there are about fifteen rooms between the inner and outer gates. For common-side debtors, six wards within the inner gate, two of them on the ground-floor, viz. the King's Ward, in which (1776) were 24 debtors; and the Prince's Ward,9debtors. Above those wards are the Middle Ward, in it were 20 debtors; and the Womens Ward, 2 debtors. Above them are the Upper Ward, 11 debtors; and the Jews Ward, 4 Jew debtors*. Near the middle ward, on the same floor, is a close darkish room for the sick. In each ward, a fire-place. In one of the rooms on the second floor (called the pump-room), the debtors have the convenience

of water. The rooms are out of repair: but the debtors keep their floors very clean. The court is small, but being paved with flat stones and the water constantly running, it is fresh and clean.

The tap-room is in the court. Adjoining is the day-room, the Bell, for men and women-felons. In a small court, there are two strong rooms (planked and studded with nails) for men-felons; and up stairs another night-room for men, and one for women. The women's room was formerly occupied for a work-{hop by a prisoner, a cooper; and the women slept in the Bell below. No straw or bedding.

On one side of the court is a chapel; with a gallery for master's-side debtors. The chapel, and indeed the whole of this prison, was quite out of repair: but at my last visit was thoroughly repaired and white-waffled. For this improvement the prisoners are obliged to the spirited and humane exertion of Mr. {fleriff Taylor.

At the roof of the prison, are spacious leads, on which the master's-side debtors are sometimes allowed to walk: but then the keeper is with them: for the leads communicate with the adjoining houses, one of which aflords a ready escape from so close a prison in case of fire.

Besides the penny loaf a day, which is from the chamber of London, there are some legacies to the debtors paid by the companies in this city, amounting to about £60 a year: they have also from the sheriffs 32 pounds of beef on Saturdays, and they had formerly from the Peacock brewhouse (Messrs. Calvert and Co.) a kind donation of two barrels of small beer a week.

In this prison eight men in 1776 had with them their wives and nineteen children. The other prisoners, I learned, had forty-four wives and one hundred and forty-four children, not in the gaol.

The act for preserving the health of prisoners is not hung up. There is now painted on a board at the door, that no visiters are to be admitted on Sundays, from ten to-twelve in the morning, nor from three to four in the afternoon.

The keeper pays to the chamber of London £30 a year rent, which is refunded to him for his trouble on night-charges*. He also pays window-tax, &c.

At this prison, as well as at New Ludgate, the Fleet, and King's Beach, I heard of the frequent visits of Dr. William Smith in 1776; who had been desired to visit the sick in the prisons of London, Westminster, and Southwark, by the committee of the Westminster charity, in consequence of their humane resolution to appropriate to this purpose the surplus of a collection made in the hard winter of 1776. Sir Charles Whitworth, the chairman, who was acquainted with the plan I had been employed on for some years, directed the Doctor to apply to me for a list of the several prisons, with which I with pleasure supplied him, and at the same time informed him of my intended publication.

Dr. Smith's attention feeiaed to be chiefly turned towards debtors, who spoke with much esteem and gratitude of him and Mr. Cofens the apothecary, who also attended; and many beneficial effects proceeded from their management. Great alterations had taken place in prisons through the attention of Parliament before the Doctor's visits; yet he discovered many abuses and frauds still practised, which he laid before the public in two pamphlets, printed for J. Bew in Paternoster-Row. 1776.

SURGEON, Mr. Withey.

THIS prison, built as appears by inscription on the front, in 1670, has only a small court or passage for all prisoners. Many apartments: yet but two rooms for common-side debtors: that for men, which is their day-room, night-room, and kitchen, with a copper, &c. is dark and dirty; about 35 feet by 18, and 16 feet high; far too small for the number of prisoners, many of whom sleep in 23 beds which are on three (lories of galleries, or broad (helves. At one of my visits there were in this room 39 debtors; seven of them had their wives and children. The room swarms with bugs. The day and night-room for women-debtors is more lightsome; in it were only two prisoners. Beyond it is a room ruinous, and fit for no use.

For men-felons there are two rooms; and two for women; one of tfiefe is a dark cell. Two dungeons, one down n steps, the other adjoining to the tap-room. No bedding or straw. Those who choose a bed pay is. a night; or else ioj. 6d.

Of the thirty-six felons &c. there were three fines and twenty-four convicts. Twelve of these were sent from the high-gaol at Exeter, Dec. 21, 1782. The convicts have six-pence a day each.

Compts*.

In the court is the chapel; and under it the tap-room, down 16 Heps. All the rooms aforesaid are within the inner gate , between which and the outer gate (i. e. in the keeper's house) are more rooms for master's-side debtors. No infirmary.

The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. The prison is greatly out of repair; the main wall on one side shored and propped.

The keeper pays to the chamber of London ^30 a year rent, which is repaid him for his expence on night-charges: he also pays window-tax; I learned from him, that in the beginning of the year 1773 his prisoners were sickly, and eleven died. For some time the governors of the General Dispensary shewed a kind attention to these poor people; and ordered their physician. Dr. Lettfom, to visit them.

He was esteemed by the prisoners.

The bread allowance is from the chamber of London. Debtors (some of whom are from the court of conscience, and lie till their debts are paid*) have from the sheriffs 32 pounds of beef on Saturday. They had formerly from the Peacock brew-house (Meflis. Calvert and Co.) a donation of two barrels of small beer a week.

There are many legacies for common-side debtors, who receive them quarterly.

The annual amount is £59: 2: 11. The master, &c. of the drapers' company

As I shall frequently have occasion to rrwntlon this class of Debtors, who are generally working people with large families, I think it may be proper to-give some account of what are called Courts of Conscience. — In 1518, the Common Council of the city of London passed an act for the recovery of debts under forty shillings due to citizens, by a court to be called a Court of Conscience, held in Guildhall; and the debtors who refused to obey the award of that court, were to be imprisoned in one of the City-Compters until they complied, although it were durante vita. In 1605, the powers of that court were established by act of parliament. In 1750, Alderman Dickenson brought in a bill for extending similar powers to the whole county of Middlesex; with this difference, that all persons refusing to submit to the decision of the court, were liable to be imprisoned in Newgate for three calendar months, which cancelled the debt. From these several adis, others have been framed for various parts of the kingdom, in some of which the term of confinement has been limited to forty days. I' have collected most of these, and find the expences, fees, &c. to be very different; in some instances amounting to three or four times the original debt.

Now, there appears to be a very obvious defect in the police respecting this matter. Why should a man for the same debt be liable in one place to imprisonment for life, in another for three months, in another only for forty days ? Why should the fees, &c. be the same for discharging a debt of fifteen pence (for such I have known a man imprisoned for), and for thirty nine shillings? It is certainly desirable that cm comprehensive statute for the whole kingdom, on this head, should be framed; wherein a proportion might be established between the sums indebted, and the fees and times of* imprisonment And particular care should be taken, that debtors of this kind be not fullered to mix with criminals, who by their instructions and example frequently render them a; abandoned as themselves.

See, farther, on this subject, a Report drawn up by the committee of the benevolent Society for the discharge and relief of persons confined for small debts.

Remarks;

come here once a year, and release fiveral debtors for small sums, and leave 40J. for the remainder, from a bequest of Mr. John Kendrick. I was informed that John Fuller, Esq. left £30 per annum, and appointed the recorder and others in trust, for the payment of fees and chamber-rent of poor debtors confined in the two compters, not exceeding 255. each, and who had been confined not less than 16 weeks. This legacy, as Mr. Kirby told me, has not been paid since 1765.

Some years since, there came once a fortnight to common-side debtors in this prison, nine stone of beef, and fourteen quartern loaves: and the like relief to other prisons also. The charitable hand was concealed; till, the donation failing on the death of the amiable princess Caroline, it was supposed that her highness had been the generous benefactress. And upon representing to the lady who had been almoner to the princess, the distress of the prisoners, she obtained from the late king a renewal of the charity; which was continued during his majesty's life.

BRIDEWELL.

This building was formerly a palace, near St. Bridget's (St. Bride's) well; from whence it had the name; which, after it became a prison, was applied to other prisons of the same sort*. It was given to the city by king Edward VI. in 1552.

That part of Bridewell which relates to my subject has wards for men and women quite separate. — The men's ward on the ground-floor is a day-room in which they

* Johnson's Dictionary.

Sect. VII. LONDON.

beat hemp; and, down two steps, a close night-room. At my late visits, a staircase was made to a room above, for the convenience of the prisoners. In both this and the night-room, a window has been lately stopt up. The women's ward is a day-room on the ground-floor, in which they beat hemp; and up stairs, two night-rooms. A chamber above these is fitted up for an infirmary. The sick were formerly sent to St. Bartholomew's hospital. All the prisoners being kept within- doors, makes it necessary to lime-white the rooms twice a year. The women's rooms are large, and have opposite windows, for fresh air. Their ward, as well as the men's, has water: and there is a hand-ventilator on the outside, with a tube to each room of the women's ward: yet their rooms were offensive. The ventilator would be of service if more frequently worked, when the rooms are crowded with prisoners: there can, however, never be a healthy prison, where the prisoners are not at times permitted, to breathe the fresh air in a court.

The prisoners are employed by a hemp-drefier, who has the profit of their labour, an apartment in the prison, and a salary of £20. I always found them at work: at my last visit they were picking oakum. I he hours of work are in winter from eight to four; in summer from six to fix, deducing meal times. The steward is allowed eight pence a day for the maintenance of each prisoner; and contrails to supply them as follows — On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, a penny loaf, ten ounces of dressed beef without bone, broth, and three pints of ten shilling' beer: on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, a penny loaf, four ounces of cheese or some butter, a pint of milk-pottage, and three pints of beer. They are served with the day's allowance about 12 o'clock. The allowance of bread is too small, in Aug. 1783,84-02. Oil. goz. The-porter or keeper is Thomas Holt. Salary, ^80; no fees. To the women's ward there is a matron, Sarah Lyon; salary, £60. She takes care of the sick, both men and women; and is allowed a shilling a day for those that are put on the sick diet. No bath.

In the winter the women have some firing. All the night-rooms are Supplied with rye-draw once a month. No other prison in London has any straw or bedding.

In Bridewell is a public chapel: the prisoners should attend every Sunday. The men and women are separated from each other, and from the rest of the congregation.

On the walls of the hall and court-room are hung up many tables of very considerable gifts and legacies to this hospital, in common with others: sufficient to have made this prison more commodious, by providing courts; and several workrooms, and lodging-rooms, for keeping the prisoners more separate, as now is very prudently done for the faulty apprentices and Bridewell boys, who were formerly confined in one room.

The Bridewell boys are upon a quite different foundation, and foreign to my subject.

Their night-ward, into which they are not permitted to go in the day-time, that the air in it may be cool and fresh, is a house on the other side of the court, divided into two apartments. Each has a room on the ground-floor, a chamber, and an upper room. In one part, these rooms are 30 feet by 31: in the other 30 by 20: near 10 feet high: well planked all over: no chimneys. For the free circulation of air, every room has in front, to the court, two windows; and backwards three, with iron bars, and shutters; but, very properly, no glass. Barrack-beds in every room; but in each of the two chambers, and in one of the lower rooms, are other beds for those who pay 3s. 6d. a week: when these are occupied, no prisoners sleep on the barrack-beds in those rooms. In this court is a lock-up room for the unruly. All the stairs are stone.

On one side of the women's court was their day-room, but it is now a lodging-room, and a new day-room, or shed with a fire-place is made on the other side of the court. Their night-rooms are — one on the ground-floor ranging with the day-room, and called the Low Ward\ 21 feet by 17, and 10 feet high — a chamber over it of the same size — and a passage or gallery over the day-room: on the back of it are five cabins or cupboards, near 10 feet by 5, with a barrack-bed for two prisoners. These closets are very close and unwholesome; having no air but from grates over the doors into the gallery. The two larger night-rooms have windows only in front. Iron bars and shutters: no glass. The windows of both the men's and women's ward are (as they should be) too high for them to look out.

The ground-floors, and the courts, are paved. There is a pump in each court; and the New-River water is laid in; but not directly from the main, as it was till lately at the neighbouring prison.

The chapel is common to this prison and the bridewell. Men of the two different prisons are on opposite sides below; and women in opposite galleries. The small-ness of the chapel, the lowness of the ceiling, the prisoners being in view of each other, and the keepers not attending, are circumstances highly improper.

The tap-house is near the outer gate. Prisoners do not come into it; but take their liquor at a wicket made for that purpose in the wall, that separates it from 'them. No infirmary: no bedding or straw.

In July 1775, the justices thought fit to raise the gaoler's fees from 5*. 6d. to ys. At my visit in 1782, two prisoners remained only for the fees.

At my first visits, there was both here and at the bridewell, a matron very properly appointed, with a fixed salary.

A generous benefactor (Mr. Wildman, a salesman in Smithfield) constantly fends the prisoners beef and bread twice a week. They have occasionally other small donations.

The fines have only the prison allowance *. — The king's evidence are put with the women in their ward, to secure them from the resentment of the other prisoners.

In December 1782, I found the county debtors were on the men's sidef, till their apartments in Newgate were rebuilt. The Ihed in the court was inclosedj the wards were glazed and had stoves.

In the keeper's garden there is inclosed a bath and a copper, designed for this prison and the bridewell, but being incommodious is not used.

If a small room (or counting-house) were made over one of the keeper's doorways, he would have a view of the men's court, and of every person coming into the prison.

In the gate-way is a board on which is painted as follows.

OVER the gate two new rooms for night-charges, as at the New Prison. In the prison, men and women have separate Courts and wards. The men have in their court (which should be paved with flat Hones), three sheds for day-rooms: one, 6 feet by 16; the other two, 6 by 10 each-, full 8 feet high. Their night-rooms opposite on the ground floor, one for fines, and one for other offenders, are about 20 feet by 14 each; with barrack-beds. One of them was so crowded, that some prisoners slept in hammocks. Over these night-rooms are chambers, with beds for those who pay 3s. 6d. a week: and another room also for fines: joining to which, is a small close room used as an infirmary for men. In another part of the court is a hemp-shop or work-shop: it is a passage to six little work-shops for faulty apprentices; 7 feet by 34. each: fronting these are their six night-rooms (8 by 4)} all on the ground-floor.

In the women's court are three sheds or day-rooms-, same size as those of the men; with a hemp-shop or work-shop. Over this, and the men's work-shop, is a long gallery or passage, in which are twelve dark unwholesome night-rooms for women;

9 feet by 7 each, and io-i- high (in some of them are beds for those who pay): but two of these rooms are now made into one for an infirmary for the women.

The keeper pays window-tax; and for the New-River water; which was till very lately directly from the main *, and always on. Besides this they have water at a pump in each court.

In July 1775, the justices augmented the fees from 5J. 6d. to ys. but now (1783) in this prison they are reduced to the old sum. In lieu of fees from acquitted prisoners, which were cancelled by the late act, the justices paid the keeper at the rate of £20 a. year from the ume when that act took place. — To this bridewell, among criminals, are committed debtors from the court of confidence; who are difi-charged after forty days.

Of the 108 in January 1777, above thirty were convicts, or fines, that is, criminals committed for a term of years. Some of these, and of the others, were sick. They complained of fore feet, which were quite black. The sick were for the most part women of the poorest sort; not able to pay for beds. No straw or bedding allowed. — There are in the whole near as many women-prisoners as men.

This prison is much too small for the number committed to it. It might be made convenient, if the adjoining ground let for a workhouse were taked in At my last visits it was clean. Of the 171 prisoners in 1779, 22 men and boys, and 58 women were( conviEls. These were employed in picking oakum; the women in two rooms below, the men up stairs-f. A warehouse and a Ihed are erected on some ground at the back of this prison.- — The convicts formerly were allowed three pence a day, but now have a pound of bread and two pence. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is here, and at the New Prison, on a printed paper.

Of the 155 at my visit in December 1782, 103 were finest all wer$ unemployed. — At my last visit, 20 men and 56 women, were convicts, and employed in picking oakum. — There were six debtors from the court of requests. — All the rooms are too close: no thorough air. In the infirmary for men, January 1783, five were sick and one dying, with little or no covering. In another room one was dead. In the

This salutary supply of water in plenty continued till last year, when the Ninu-Ri<uer-Company thought fit to take it off, on laying new pipes towards Marybonne. I cannot but mention here the Company's refusal to supply with a small pipe the Penitentiary hou/et, which were proposed to be built on a fine rife in the fields at Islington, near which is one of the most copious springs of water, which runs to waste, called the White-Conduit. Dr. Fothergill and myself were the more surprized at this refusal, as the Company had obliged so many persons to resign, for the public benefit, their gardens, pleasure grounds, &c. We did not doubt, however, that Parliament would have compelled them to grant so reasonable a request.

+ This is a salutary employment, as the strong cent of the pitch and tar may counteract any contageous or unhealthy effluvia in the work-rooms.

WHITECHAPEL PRISON,

FOR DEBTORS.

This is a prison for the liberties and manors of Stepney and Hackney. The former ineludes, by a printed lift which I have, towns, parishes, villages, streets, lanes, &c. to the number of forty-six; and was granted by king Edward VI. to lord Wentworth, and his heirs for ever.

In it are confined those whose debts are above £2, and under £5. The master's-side prisoners have four sizeable chambers, fronting the road; i. e. two on each story. They pay 2s. 6d. a week; and lie two in a bed; two beds in a room. The common-side debtors are in two long rooms in the court, near the tap-room; men in one room; women in the other: the court-yard in common. They hang out a begging-box from a little closet in the front of the house; and attend it in turn. It brings them only a few pence a day, and of this pittance none partake but those who at entrance have paid the keeper 2s. 6d. and treated the prisoners with half a gallon of beer. When I was there in 1777, no more than three had purchased this privilege.

The prison is out of repair. It is the property of the lady of the manor. The keeper, George Garred, is an officer: he pays rent £24; and window-tax, and all other taxes. He keeps the tap. Fees, £0: 8: 1. No table: but in November 1776, I saw a paper hung up, on which was written as follows:

At the same time I saw another paper intitled Rules and Orders to be observed in this Prison. It was dated Aug. 6, 1776. The first rule is, " That every person who comes into this prison as a prisoner, shall pay for his garnish 2s. 10~dP

The clauses of the act against spirituous liquors hung up.

At my first visit there were on the common-side two prisoners in hammocks, sick and very poor. — No chaplain. A compassionate man, who was not a regular clergyman, sometimes preached to them on Sunday; and gave them some small relief.

Lady Pownshend fends a guinea twice a year, which her servant distributes equally among the prisoners.

As debtors here are generally very poor, I was surprised to see once ten or twelve noisy men at skittles; but the turnkey said they were only visitants. I found they were admitted here as at another public house. No prisoners were at play with them. — The court-room is near this prison.

The above was the account at the time of my former visits; but in 1779 I was informed that not a tenth part of the usual business has been transacted here since the act for extending the provisions of an act to prevent frivolous and vexatious arrests. 19 Geo. III. Cap. LXX.

In 1782 the prison was in a ruinous condition, yet sometimes here are one or two prisoners.

By an act in 1781; 21 Geo. III. entitled, " An act for diminishing the fees payable, and altering the mode of proceeding, in the court of record within the manors of

Stepney and Hackney, 8cc." imprisonment is fixed " for a time not exceeding one week for every pound of the total of the debt and costs." By this good act no prisoners can be confined here more than five or six weeks. Debtors from the court of conscience for sums under 40l. are sent to Clerkenwell bridewell.

TOWER HAMLETS GAOL,

IN WELL-CLOSE SQUARE.

This prison is at a public house, kept by an honest Swede, who is gaoler. There is a court-room in the house for the Tower Hamlets. The prison-yard was 116 feet by 18, latticed over head. At one end, were two large rooms; in which French prisoners were confined some years ago. The prison-rooms were towards the other end of the court: on the ground-floor a day-room or closet about 5I. feet by 34., with a chimney. Up stairs three night-rooms. Debtors from the court of conscience are sent to Clerkenwell bridewell. Fees, 9s. id. No table. Allowance, from a penny to two pence a day. No straw. At my last visit the prison was almost in ruins.

St. CATHARINE'S GAOL.

This prison, rebuilt about fifteen years ago, is a small house of two stories; two rooms on a floor. In April 1774, there was a keeper, but no prisoners. I have since that, called two or three times, and found the house uninhabited: in August 1779, it was inhabited, but there were no prisoners. In December 1782 also there were no prisoners, and I was informed there had been none since 1779. In August flL 17.83. it was uninhabited.

Remarks* This prison for the military, has two rooms called the Guard-rooms; because in them are confined offenders who are of the king's guards. The remainder of the building over the gate is the keeper's house. On the opposite side of the court, is a large room down five steps, the Hall. On the left-hand side of the court is another hall, not so large: at each end of it is a room with barrack-bedsteads and beds; both rooms very close and unhealthy. Over them are other barrack-rooms, somewhat more airy. N°. 1, 2, and 4, and the room over N°. 1, and the lodging-room called the Store-room adjoining to the guard-rooms, are of good size: and the practice of lime whiting adopted here since my first visits, is salutary for the prisoners. There are, besides, the black hole, the condemn d holdt the cock pit, and several other parts of this irregular building, which I pass over. March 15, 1776, there were 119 prisoners; of whom 49 were transports. I saw many sick and dying. The gaol was so infected by them, that the distemper was caught there by many afterwards.

May 25, Prisoners 37. Many of them sick of the gaol-distemper, in the rooms where I saw the sick and dying in March. The whole was out of repair. Keeper, Capt. Jackson: salary, .£50. Allowance, four pence a day, in provisions. 1779, Aug. 13, Prisoners 98, viz. 64 Deserters, 21 Impressed men, and 13 of the Guards. The prisoners were in health; the rooms made somewhat more airy, and three rooms over the hall were fitted up for an infirmary. 1782, Dec. 20, Prisoners 92. The prison was not dirty, nor the rooms offensive except in the infirmary. Three of the guards were in close confinement on bread and water for 48 hours. — One was sick in the prison, and 12 in two of the close rooms of the infirmary; in the other room, one of the transports left here lay dead. Keeper, Capt. Osborne. 1783,. Aug. 29, Prisoners 56. Fourteen were of the guards, of whom 10 were in the black hole on bread and water for 24 or 48 hours. Some of the prisoners, having received his majesty's pardon on condition of inlisting, and afterwards deserted, had been here from 7 to 16 months. — The rooms were very clean; they are lime-whited twice a year, and they are washed every day, the prisoners being turned out of them early in the morning. — There had been none sick in the hospital for two months.

A chapel, in which Mr. Smith reads a chapter, and part of the Common Prayer-book every morning.

The women should have another day-room: and one of the day-rooms for men should be enlarged. The courts adjacent might also be enlarged. — The rooms for women, and their court, are now more airy, the garden-pales being set farther off. The keeper pays window-tax, and for water.

There is now a work-shop with hemp-blocks, and a room over it. Two of the women's night-rooms are appropriated to female convicts, who have also a separate court with water, &c. As I have seen several sick objects on the floors, the gentlemen, who are so ready to relieve the sufferings of their fellow-creatures, will forgive the intimation that an infirmary might be made over the women's ward.

There will be a fepa* ration of debtors and felons; and in the court of the latter are four small rooms for the refractory. Both debtors and felons, though not seen by one another, will be in view from the pulpit, and there the keeper can easily observe them when they are locked up. The courts will be plentifully supplied with water, by pipes from the main. The outer walls are too low, so that tools &c. may be easily conveyed over. — To make this a secure prison, a surrounding wall (as at Hertford gaol) must be built.

THIS prison was part old buildings, part new.

The old buildings were — a coffee-room just within the' gate — and a street called King-street. On the right hand was the tap-house 5 and four houses for prisoners: each consisted of a ground-floor, and two floors of chambers; four rooms on each floor; near 10 feet square, and 7 high. On the left-hand side of the street was the chapel; and six houses for prisoners; of equal depth with the former houses: but the back-rooms had not, as the former had, communication with the fore-rooms. At the hither end of the fore-rooms, on the ground-floor, was a common kitchen, much too small. The cook, a prisoner, had the room over it. These houses also had ground-rooms, and two floors of chambers. All the rooms fronting King-street, and the whole of the houses on the other side the way, were for master's-side debtors; who paid for each room unfurnished a shilling a week. The back-part of the left-hand row was the common-fidej the doors in the back-front. The first room on the ground-floor they called their court-room. The two houses at the further end had six rboms each,

King's Bench.

[Remarks.]

---

244 SOUTHWARK,

[King's Bench.]

for crown-debtors and fines; and were called Crown-court. The rest of this range on all the three floors was for common-side debtors. At the farther end of King-street, in a small court enclosed from the rest of the yard, was a building called the State-house consisting of ground-floors, and two floors of chambers; four sizeable rooms on each floor; total twelve. A debtor who chose to be here, paid the marshal from eight to ten guineas for his whole time; besides a shilling a week, like other master's-side debtors.

All these old buildings were out of repair.

---

The new buildings were — first, a house at the gate for the turnkey. The chambers were very convenient; and were let to a prisoner who paid a very high rent. — But the principal new building was at the farther end of the yard. The two parts of it formed a right angle. One part was four houses, with four ground-rooms to each; and the same number of chambers on each of the three floors above; total sixty-four. The rooms were about 13 feet by 11, and about eight feet high. The other part (the wing) was built as the Fleet prison; but more airy and commodious. It had the same number of floors as the first part. On each floor was a passage 7*feet wide, and 73^ long:, rooms on each side the passage, eleven on each floor, total forty-four; each room 13^ feet by 9I, about 3 feet high.

The prison is well supplied with water. Among the improvements, of 108 new rooms, and a spacious court, they should have built an infirmary. At more than one of my visits (which I repeated to this as well as many other prisons much oftener than the times when I took the numbers) some had the small-pox. It was so crowded the summer 1776, that a prisoner paid five shillings a week for half a bed, and many lay-in the chapel. In May 1776, the number of prisoners within the walls was 395; and by an accurate lift which I procured, their wives (including a few that were only called so) were 279, children 725, total 1004: about two thirds of these were in the prison.

The above was the state of the prison in 1776] but afterwards some of the old buildings were taken down, and a chapel and many rooms added to the new buildings, and another wing similar to that which has been already mentioned, but no infirmary. — This spacious prison is enclosed with a strong wall about thirty feet high, with a chevaux de firife.

The Rules, or bounds of this prison are extensive, including St. George's Fields, one side of Rlackman-street, and part of the Borough High-street, of which a plan is publi ftied.

This prison is visited at Michaelmas term, as the act directs*; yet at my first visits there was a wine-club, and a beer-club; and one could scarcely ever enter the walls without seeing parties at skittles, miflifippi, portobello, tennis, fives, &c.

The above was the account of the prison before it was burnt by the rioters in 1780: and now it is rebuilt on the plan of the former new buildings. No infirmary. Many good regulations are introduced, and a stop is put in a great measure to gaming and the illicit practice of selling spirituous liquors and smuggled goods.

The tables of rules and orders for the government of this prison are hung up (as required by the preamble) for common inspection, I presume to give an abridgment of them.

Rules and Orders for the better Government, &c. Made and Signed the 25th of November 1729.

1. The stocks to be kept up for punishment of blasphemers, swearers, riotous, &c.

2. Against illegal methods of confinement. None to be confined in an unusual place or manner, unless for attempting to escape. And such may appeal to the court, or a judge.

3. Marshal not to remove any to the Fleet by writ of habeas corpus.

4. Marshal not to remove any one from the common-side and its benefits without three days notice: during which time, the prisoner may appeal to a judge.

5. Coroner's inquest upon the dead.

6. Against garnish and partial distribution of dividends.

7. Prisoners to send out for necessaries; and to bring in their own bedding, &c.

Three excellent rules have been lately hung up.

Monday next after three weeks from the day of the Holy Trinity in the 19th Year of King George the Third.

King's Bench Prison. Upon full and mature consideration had here in court. It is ordered by the said court, that any man may lawfully be turned out of his chamber for the following causes (that is to say) If such person lets his chamber to another, or does not reside there himself, or if such person might have taken the benefit of any insolvent act or the lords' act; or if he be charged by a friendly or collusive action where there is no real debt.

By the Court.

Friday next after fifteen days from the day of the Holy Trinity in the 19th Year of King George the Third.

King's Bench Prison. It is ordered that all prisoners who have been or shall be in the custody of the marshal of the Marshalsea for the space of six months after they are supersedeable although not superseded shall be forthwith discharged out of the prison of the marshal of the Marshalsea by the said marshal as to all such actions in which they have been or shall be supersedeable. And that no prisoner shall be intitled to any room in the said prison by reason of seniority except from the time of his being charged in the actions in which he is not supersedeable.

By the Court.

Wednesday next after three weeks from the day of the Holy Trinity, in the 21st Year of King George the Third.

King's Bench Prison. It is ordered by this court, that the marshal of the Marshalsea of this court shall permit no persons to enter into the prison without their being first searched, to see Whether they have any spirituous liquors about them: and that he do not suffer the wives or children of any of the prisoners to lodge in the prison, under any pretence whatsoever; and that the marshal do prescribe in what manner, and for how long time, visitors shall be allowed to see or stay with the prisoners, according to the circumstances of every case in his discretion.

By the Court.

There were, besides, in this prison, as in the Fleet, certain printed rules made by the prisoners themselves, "to be obeyed and observed by every member of this College" (as they were pleased to term it). Many of them were arbitrary and improper: but now they are abolished.

I procured a list of gifts and donations now belonging to the prisoners on the common side of the King's Bench prison, which is as follows:

[Remarks.]

TO this prison of the Court of the Marshalsea, and of the King's Palace-Court of Westminster, are brought debtors arrested for the lowest sums, any where within twelve miles of the palace, except in the city of London; and also persons committed for piracy.

The deputy marshal, under whose particular custody this prison is, has his appointment from the knight marshal of the king's household for the time being. The great abuses practised by this officer were reported to parliament by the Gaol-Committee in 1729.

This prison is held under several leases by the widow of the late deputy marshal at the yearly rent of £101. It is an old irregular building (rather several buildings) in a spacious court. There are, in the whole, near sixty rooms; and yet only six of them left for common-side debtors. Of the other rooms, — five were let to a man who was not a prisoner: in one of them he kept a chandler's shop; in two he lived with his family: the other two he let to prisoners. Four rooms, the Oaks, were for women. They were too few for the number; and the more modest women complained of the bad company, in which they were confined. There were above

Sect. VII. SOUTHWARK. 251

[Marshalsea.]

forty rooms for men on the master's-side, in which were about sixty beds; yet at my first visits, many prisoners had no beds nor any place to sleep in, but the chapel, and the tap-room. The chamber-rent wants regulation; for in several rooms where four lie in two beds, and in some dark rooms where two lie in one bed, each pays 3s. 6d. a week for his lodging.

The prison is greatly out of repair. No infirmary. The court is well supplied with water. In it the prisoners play at rackets, &c. and in a little back court, the Park, at skittles.

The tap was let to a prisoner in the rules of the King's Bench prison; this prison being just within those rules. I was credibly informed, that one Sunday in the summer 1775, about 600 pots of beer were brought in from a public house in the neighbourhood (Ashmore's) the prisoners not then liking the tapster's beer.

In March 1775, when the number of prisoners was 175, there were with them in this incommodious prison wives and children 46.

Since the act of the 19th of Geo. III. Chap. LXX. there are not so many debtors in this prison as formerly; yet they are increasing, for I find here, and in other prisons, many debtors whose original debts are much under £10. but for the purpose of imprisoning such debtors, they are prosecuted either in the court of exchequer, or in other inferior courts, until the expences of such prosecutions which added to the original debt amount to £10. A fresh action is then taken out in the superior courts, for the small original debt, and the accumulated costs of prosecution. — Thus the salutary purposes of the said act are defeated*.

Mr. Henry Allnott, who was many years since a prisoner here, had, during his confinement, a large estate bequeathed to him. He learned sympathy by his sufferings; and left £100 a year for discharging poor debtors from hence, whose debts do not exceed £4. As he bound his manor of Goring in Oxfordshire for charitable uses, this is called the Oxford charity. Many are cleared by it every year.

I procured a list of the legacies and donations which are regularly paid, but no table was hung up.

A List of Charities belonging to the Common Side of the Marshalsea Prison.

County Money ,£15 per Quarter. — (By the 43d Eliz. Chap. II. Sect. 15.)

* In the Report from the (aforesaid) Committee appointed to inquire into the state of the gaols. May 14, 1729, on the Marshalsea prison, are these words, "Many prisoners are so poor as to be committed for a debt of one shilling only; for by the usage of the said court of record, processes are issued for the smallest sums; and tho; the cause of action is but one penny, a process is issued, the process is returned, and the proceedings are carry'd on, till such time as the costs amount to above 40s. and thereupon the debtor is thrown into prison, and by adding the costs to the debt the late act of parliament against frivolous and vexations arrests is eluded."

[Remarks.]

THIS prison, in Tooley-street, for the borough of Southwark, which contains four parishes and a part of a fifth, had in 1779, for master's-side debtors, seven rooms — for common-side debtors, a room on the ground-floor, in which felons &c. were with them night and day; a long room up stairs, the Rookery; and a room over it, useless, because not secure. — The women were in the stone kitchen, then divided into two rooms. Three of the common-side rooms had barrack-beds. Most of the debtors are poor creatures from the court of conscience, who lie there till their debts are paid*. — There was a small court; and a chapel, but no chaplain appointed.

The whole prison was much out of repair, and ruinous. No infirmary. No bedding or straw. The keeper is put in by the high bailiff, whose office is in the disposal of the court of aldermen. — An inscription over the gate, dated 1716, called it the Borough Court: but the courts are held at St. Margaret's Hill.

This prison might have been made more commodious, by building on a piece of ground, at the back of it, 41 feet by 20, which the keeper used as a garden.

* The Society for relief of persons imprisoned for small debts, release many debtors from this prison.

This gaol was pulled down by the rioters in 1780, and the present prison is an adjoining house hired by the keeper. The court only 14½ feet by 11. A day-room below (17 feet by 12), stone-floor. The men's lodging-room (16 feet by 14) on the second floor, in which at my last visit there were 17, and sometimes there have been two or three and twenty. The women lodge in the common day-room. No bedding. Here are three or four rooms for those that pay. Debtors have 65 penny loaves once in eight weeks, from a legacy of Eleanor Gwinn. No memorial hung up, no table of fees, nor clauses against spirituous liquors.

[Remarks.]

THE old gaol, built in 1702, was in the middle of the town. In front two small day-rooms, for felons, in which they were always locked up: no fire-place. — Their dungeons or night-rooms, one down 18 steps, the other 19. Over their day-rooms, was a large lumber-room; and joining to it a lodging-room for women-felons. Backward was a small court for debtors, and women-felons. On each side of it were two rooms on the ground-floor, and two chambers for debtors. No chapel. No infirmary. The act for preserving the health of prisoners, and clauses against spirituous liquors, not hung up.

In the interval of two of my visits the gaol-fever prevailed, and carried off seven or eight prisoners, and two turnkeys*. The felons were on that occasion removed to the bridewell. At my second visit in 1776, four were sick.

* I was well informed, that a prisoner brought out as dead, from one of the dungeons, on being washed under the pump, shewed signs of life, and soon after recovered. Since this, I have known other instances of the same kind. (See page 23.)

256 HERTFORDSHIRE. Home Circuit.

[Hertford County Gaol.]

This old gaol could not have been made healthy and convenient: but the prisoners are now in a new one situated just out of the town, with separate wards (16 feet 8 inches by 11 feet 7) and courts for debtors, men-felons and women-felons: the whole is properly surrounded by a wall 15 feet high: which being at a considerable distance from the building, the keeper has within it a convenient garden.

The felons looked healthy and well, which I am persuaded was owing to the gaoler's not crowding them into a few rooms.

An obvious defect or two in this new gaol I will just mention, that architects employed in such buildings may not imitate them. The rooms are not vaulted. The corridor is too narrow, but feet wide; and the pillars (not being of stone, or circular) make the rooms dark and close. The door-ways are only 1 foot 10 inches wide, so that no crib-bedsteads can be introduced. — The two rooms appropriated for the sick, are too small. No bath. The chapel close, has no cupola.

[Remarks.]

THE old prison was close, and frequently infected with the gaol-distemper. Inquiring in October 1775, for the head-turnkey, I was told he died of it.

In the tap-room there hung a paper on which, among other things, was written, "Prisoners to pay garnish or run the gauntlet."

Debtors have a bushel of coals a day from about 12th of November to the 12th of May: and £5 a year by a legacy of Elizabeth Herris from lands in Brentwood, paid by the rector or minister of the parish of Chelmsford on the 24th of December. By a memorial hung up in the tap-room, it appears the bequest was acknowledged by the testatrix 14th June 1746. — It was generous in the justices to grant debtors the same allowance as felons , and very judicious to fix that allowance to a certain weight.

It gave me pain to be informed in 1775, that there had been no divine service for above a year past, except to condemned criminals.

The new gaol exceeds the old one in strength and convenience as much as in splendour. The county, to their honour, have spared no cost. The prison was

[Chelmsford County Gaol.]

finished and occupied at the time of my visit in 1779. The debtors rooms are 17 feet 10 inches by 15 feet 3, and 9 feet 10 high. At one end of their court is a work-room 37½ feet by 14½, and 12 feet 5 inches high, with a fire-place and four large windows: here many were weaving garters. Over this is their free ward. At the other end of the court is their hall or kitchen, in which clauses against spirituous liquors painted on a board were hung up, and the memorial of Mrs. Herris's legacy, and a new table of fees. The felons rooms (15 feet 9 inches by 14½) are lofty, lined with stone and vaulted. Near their court are two rooms in a small area for the condemned. The women-felons are separated; they have two rooms, a court and a pump. The courts are paved with flat stone. There is a chapel. Only one close room for an infirmary, which, being unfurnished, has never been used, though at my last visit several were sick on the floors. No bath. The felons apartments being entirely out of sight from the gaoler's house, I beg leave to observe, that a window might be made in his kitchen, which would overlook the felons court. The window in the debtors apartment towards the street was highly improper, as an avenue for introducing at all times spirituous liquors, tools, &c. but it is now stopped up. The straw in the felons-rooms (as also in the bridewell) is on the floors. Such cribs or cradles as are in the hospital at Plymouth (see plate II.) would be much more conducive to health and cleanliness. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is not hung up: and this gaol has not been white-washed since it was first occupied; a fault too common in new gaols. — The felons are too much crowded at night, when some of their rooms are empty.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

[Bridewells.]

CHELMSFORD. On the ground-floor a large work-room, a kitchen, and a lodging-room for men: over them rooms of the same size for women: two rooms for the sick. Prisoners always kept within doors; and the rooms very offensive by the sewers*. Neither here nor at the gaol, are there proper drains or sewers. Mr. Ford (the keeper) told me at one of my visits that many had been ill of the gaol-fever, brought from the county gaol. His salary, £30: under-keeper's, £16: no fees. Prisoners allowance, three pence a day; for which they have a pound and half of bread, and a quart of small beer; and three halfpence a day farther allowance to each sick prisoner. Coals, straw, brooms, &c. £4: 2: 6 a quarter. The employment of the prisoners is spinning wool, at a penny a skain: the county has the profit. At my last visit, there were several sick and dirty objects on the floor, with little or no covering. No bath. Garnish 2s.

COLCHESTER. The castle, the property of the late Charles Gray, Esq. was formerly the county gaol. That part of it which is now the bridewell, has — first, a room with a fire-place: on one side a room with a window; on another side two rooms at a right angle with the former; a window in the farthermost. The rooms are about 13 feet square. The partitions are iron-grates for light and air, from the window at each end, and there is no decent separation of the sexes. Court little used by prisoners. No water: here was a well of fine water.

* Those conveniences, which delicacy forbids enlarging upon, yet which are absolutely necessary to all houses, and the situation and construction of which are of the greatest importance in prisons and other crowded buildings, have always engaged my peculiar attention: I am convinced, that want of care respecting them is a principal cause of unhealthiness in many of our gaols. The reader will please to take notice, that under the words sewers and drains every thing is comprehended which I had to say on this subject in my remarks on the several prisons.

NEWPORT. Built in 1775. The front is elegant, yet plain: in it are the keeper's apartments; and a room for the justices. Behind is the men's court; in the middle of which is a pump. On the farther side, a large work-room on the ground-floor with a fire-place (the only one in the prison), and a smaller workroom over it: so that too many need not work together. There is a lodging-room even with the upper work-room. On the left side of the court are two lodging-rooms on the ground-floor, and two above. In all these lodging-rooms are boarded bedsteads: the sewers are offensive. The keeper has a view of this court from two of his back windows. — Women have a small room on the ground-floor; and one over it, 10½ feet square. These, though they join to the last mentioned rooms for men, have no communication with them: you go to them through one of the keeper's rooms: the court quite separate. But the rooms being too small for the number of women, at my three last: visits I found them in the men's ward. If two of the men's rooms were added to the women's, there might always be an entire separation. No infirmary. Allowance now, two pounds of bread each. Straw, £2 a year. Firing in winter, two guineas. Keeper's salary, £25: now £32: no fees. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. — If a latticed partition and door were made in the court, about six feet from the keeper's door, it would prevent the prisoners from rushing out.

The prisoners did spin, but were not allowed any part of what they earned. — This prison was burnt down in March 1781, and four prisoners pertshed in the flames. At my last visit, another prison was building on some ground purchased by the county.

[Remarks.]

THIS gaol was erected in 1746, as appears by the date. On the first floor there are eight rooms for debtors, which open into a passage 6 feet 2 inches wide. Under these are the felons wards near 13 feet square: but the air and light are obstructed (the wall being 3 feet thick) by double wooden bars inches broad (instead of single iron ones), at the windows both of debtors and felons. There are three courts: one for debtors; one for men-felons; and one for women-felons. The two last are much too small (that for men which is the largest only 28 feet by 27); but may be commodiously enlarged from the ground at the back of the gaol. Divine service was performed upon the stairs, but the chapel is now made commodious by the staircase being removed. The felons night-rooms have double doors; if one of them was an iron lattice door (as in the new gaol at Horsham) and was locked up in the day-time, the rooms would freshen and be better ventilated. There are two dungeons (12½ feet square) down eleven steps for the condemned.

Home Circuit. KENT. 265

[Maidstone County Gaol.]

Felons are allowed yearly ten chaldron of coals: they have barrack-beds*, and hopbagging with straw; but no coverlets. This county has for years past been so considerate as to pay the fees of poor prisoners acquitted: and to transports cast at assizes, who are entitled to the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week, they continue the allowance which they had before trial. They also pay the gaoler's fees for those convicts. The felons formerly said they wished for more bread; and would, if that were increased, be content with less beer. The baker who serves the felons sells thirteen loaves to the dozen; and debtors have amongst them every thirteenth loaf, and are now allowed yearly three chaldron of coals.

There is an alarm-bell; and a sail-ventilator.

The infirmary is improperly situated. No bath. On examining two sick prisoners in 1779, I found they had no irons; and the Surgeon said the gaoler was always ready to take them off when he requested it.

The clauses of the act against spirituous liquors are hung up. Act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up.

Without great attention to cleanliness and the separation of the sick, here will be great danger of the gaol-fever, from the offensiveness of the wards and even the court of the men-felons.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

MAIDSTONE. This prison was built in 1776. Two rooms and a small day-room, an infirmary and court for each sex. The courts are paved with flag-stones as the debtors court should be in the county gaol, for frequent washing freshens prisons*. Keeper's salary, £20, now £30. The prisoners were not in it in 1776; but in 1779 I found it inhabited, dirty and offensive. The prisoners were at work, but they have no part of what they earn. The county allowance is three pence every day, Sundays excepted, and now five chaldron of coals a year. Fees 3s. 6d. No table; but printed rules, orders and regulations established under the acts of 7th Jam. I. 17th Geo. II. and 22d Geo. III. were hung up in the wards. In 1779 I saw two prisoners with the small-pox, lying on loose straw, and their only covering was common mats.

The men have a hall or kitchen to the street, and three wards or night-rooms 15 feet by 13, which open into a passage near feet wide. No court. Out of the keeper's garden or yard might be taken a court for the men. There is no water within reach of the men; yet I found the prison clean, and regularly white-washed. An alarm-bell is lately put up. County allowance, two pennyworth of bread a day (weight Dec. 5, 1782, 18 oz.). No employment. In 1776, the justices abolished the fees 13s. 4d. and raised the salary from £25

DARTFORD. This county bridewell, built in 1720, consists of two rooms: one for men 20½ feet by 17 feet 10 inches: one for women, 14 feet square: both 10 feet high. No chimneys: offensive sewers; and the rooms dirty: no water: no straw: mats, but quite worn out. No court; though the keeper has a garden. His salary, £20: fees, 3s. 6d. no table. Allowance to those committed on suspicion of felony, two pence halfpenny a day.

The keeper told me, they had about two years ago, a bad fever; which himself and family, and every fresh prisoner caught. Three died of it. — The prisoners were well, and at work, upon a manufacture of flax-dressing and weaving sacks.

The above was the account of this prison in 1776; but in 1779, there were two courts taken from the keeper's garden, one for each sex, with pumps and sewers, and a room in the men's court for the sick: but the women had no mats or any kind of bedding.

Here are three dungeons (12 feet by 5), damp, and not secure. The floors should be boarded. At my last visit I found one prisoner, who had been committed for three months from July 18th, still in confinement for the court fees, 9s. 4d. and the keeper's fees, 3s. 6d. — Committed in 1780, one hundred and seven prisoners; — in 1781, ninety-two; — and in 1782, one hundred and three.

Allowance, two pence a day. Keeper a sergeant: no salary: fees, 6s. no table. At my visit in 1779, I found two debtors who had been locked up some weeks in the close offensive room next the street. — The court-room was built, as appears by the date, in 1687, and it is probable, there has been no alteration in the prison since that time.

DOVER CASTLE,

For Debtors in the Cinque-Ports, i. e. Hastings, Dover, Hyth, Romney, and Sandwich.

The Earl of Holderness was constable; now Frederick Lord North is constable, and Philip Leman, bodar. Two rooms: one 20½ feet by 12½, the other 13 feet by 11.

* This work-house is finely situated, a river running between the two courts; but being an old building, the rooms close, and the ceilings low, it cannot be convenient and salutary for the numerous inhabitants.

† This bridewell is in a house appointed for the reception of six poor travellers. The design of this charity may be seen from the following inscription placed over the door. " Richard JVatts, Esq;

by his will dated 22d of August, 1579, founded this charity, for six poor travellers, who, not " being rogues or proctors, may receive gratis, for one night, lodging, entertainment, and four pence each."

Remarks. THE rooms in the old gaol were too small, except the free-ward for debtors. No straw: no court; and yet ground enough for one behind the gaol. Transports convicted at quarter sessions, had as those condemned at assize, the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week. Lent assize at East-Grinstead; where the prisoners are confined in a garret at the George alehouse; formerly they were shut up in a butcher's cellar. Summer assize, at Lewes and Horsham alternately.

The new gaol that was building in 1776, I found finished in 1779. The duke of Richmond, in concurrence with the other gentlemen of the county, interested himself much in this affair. The situation is judiciously chosen; and the plan is such as appears to me particularly well suited for the purpose. It does credit to those who superintended the work, being every way substantial and strong. Each felon has a separate room 10 feet by 7, and 9 feet high to the crown of the arch. They are all arched with brick, to prevent danger and confusion in case of fire. To each room are two doors, one of them iron-latticed.

* See page 21.

Home Circuit. SUSSEX. 271

[Horsham County Gaol.]

This gaol has two floors over arcades; the ascent to each is by a stone staircase with iron rails. On each floor, both on the debtors and felons side, there are ten rooms (five on each side a passage 5 feet wide), besides a day-room (28 feet by 12 feet 3 inches) and a lodging-room for a turnkey. Each floor has an iron-lattice door; and every room has a shutter for the window, a bedstead, a canvass straw bed, and two blankets: and the county is so considerate as to allow a bushel of coals to the debtors, and the same quantity to the felons, every day during the six winter months.

Here, are two spacious courts with water in each; and a wall encloses the whole prison. — Near the gate is a poor's box, for obtaining prisoners groats.

The felons on their entrance are washed with warm water, and each man is clothed in a green striped uniform of coat, waistcoat and breeches, and has two shirts, two pair of stockings, a pair of shoes, a hat and woollen cap.

The county has very prudently settled the number of turnkeys (viz. three): to each they pay half a guinea a week, and one of them goes twice a day to purchase provisions and liquors for debtors; and it is properly fixed that they shall not exceed one pint of wine, or one quart of strong beer a day each. Felons have only water for their drink. The justices have sent in scales and weights, which is a check on die baker. Several loaves I saw weighed were full 2lb.

The clauses against spirituous liquors are hung up; and the gaol is kept very clean. The act for preferring the health of prisoners is not hung up. I would just observe, that the gaoler should have a window in his kitchen towards the debtors court, and in his parlour towards that of the felons. — I do not omit the old table of fees, though this county has set a noble example of abolishing all fees, and also the tap: in consequence of this I found the gaol as quiet as a private house.

Formerly there was no chaplain, but a clergyman had £5 a year for attending condemned criminals.

HORSHAM. The bridewell which was in this town is now discontinued.

LEWES. Here men and women have similar but separate apartments; a kitchen, five bed-rooms 10 feet square, a workshop, court, &c. Keeper's salary, £30. Fees, 6s. 8d. no table. The produce of the prisoners work for three years preceding 1776, was not twenty shillings a year; although there were in the respective years committed prisoners 45 — 85 — 65. At my last visits I found no prisoners at work; but as there were chalk, mallets, sieves, &c. in the men's work-room, it seems that they are sometimes employed in making whiting. When they work, the keeper has all the profits. The county allowance is 1½d. in bread (weight in Dec. 1782, 13 oz.). The keeper has no view from his house into the rooms or courts of the prison. Surgeon, Mr. Turner. He makes a bill: for the sick he orders better nourishment. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up.

PETWORTH. This bridewell has two rooms: one 17 feet by 10, the other 18 by 9, 6 feet high: too small for the general number of prisoners. No chimney: no glass or shutters to the windows: no court: no water: no employment. Allowance now, a two-pound loaf every day, to be weighed by the keeper with scales and weights ordered to the house by the justices and which should be kept for that purpose only. Keeper's salary lately augmented from £12 to £20. Fees, 6s. 8d. no table. But now the keeper's salary is augmented to £30 in lieu of all fees.

The keeper told me (in September 1774) that "all his prisoners upon discharge, were much weakened by the close confinement, and small allowance."

Thomas Draper and William Godfrey were committed the 6th of January 1776; the former died the 11th, the other the 26th of the same month. William Cox, committed the 13th of January, died the 23d. None of them had the gaol-fever. I do not affirm that these men were famished to death: it was extreme cold weather. However, since that time, the allowance of bread is doubled. For this the prisoners are indebted to the kind attention of the duke of Richmond. — This prison (rented by the county) has caused the death of many poor creatures: but I have now the pleasure to hear that it will soon be discontinued, a new one being under the consideration of the justices.

[Remarks.]

THE New Gaol, besides the gaoler's house, and the tap-room, has — for master's-side debtors, a parlour, and four other sizeable rooms; and for common-side debtors, three good rooms. Mr. Hall prevents their being crowded with the wives and children of the debtors. For these prisoners, there is a court; into which felons are not admitted; except a few, whom the gaoler has reasons for indulging with that distinction.

The ward for men-felons has six rooms on three floors; in these they sleep. There is a court belonging to it. — The ward for women-felons has two lower rooms, two above; and a court. — The felons courts should be paved with flat stones, not only for the convenience of washing, but for safety, as pebbles are dangerous. In the men's court there should be a pump and a convenient bath, for at several of my visits the Thames water was off.

Home Circuit. SURREY. 275

[Southwark County Gaol.]

In the two upper rooms of the women's ward, are put malefactors of either sex condemned to die, and sometimes pirates. I have here noted eighteen rooms: yet they are not sufficient for the number of prisoners. Mr. Hall is sometimes obliged to put men-felons into some rooms of the women's ward. In so close a prison situated in a populous neighbourhood, I did not wonder frequently to find several felons sick on the floors. No bedding nor straw. The act for preserving the health of prisoners and the clauses against spirituous liquors are hung up.

A chapel and two close rooms for the sick, lately built on the vacant ground where formerly was the house of correction; after the riots in 1780, were used for a bridewell till that in St. George's Fields was rebuilt. At my last visit the chapel was fitted up, and the two small rooms for an infirmary: these are on the ground-floor, only one window in each. Many were sick on the dirty floors; one of the turnkeys had lately died of a fever: of the fifty-five felons &c. in October 1783; sixteen were fines, and I have the names and the sentences of twenty-five convicts, who are left languishing in this sickly gaol*.

Transports have not the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week. For these a merchant formerly contracted with the county to take them at the gaol: the gaoler sent them to the ship, attended by his servants; and received from the merchant 10s. 6d. for each prisoner so conducted.

Lent assize is at Kingston: summer assize at Guildford and Croydon† alternately.

There is hung up in the gaol a printed list of sixteen legacies and donations. The dates of the first six are 1555, 1571, 1576, 1584, 1597, 1598. Three are in the next century, viz. 1609, 1638, 1656. The other seven are not dated: and one of them noted on the list, has not been received since 1726. There are also other articles which seem to need inspection. Two of the charities are for debtors expressly: the others are not so distinguished; but debtors have them all. In the title of the paper it is said, "The gaol was formerly called the White Lion Prison." The common seal of the prison is a lion rampant. One of the legacies was bequeathed by Eleanor Gwynn, from which are sent to this prison once in eight weeks, sixty-five penny loaves. Common-side debtors have this as well as the preceding gifts.

Here I would just mention, that all the rags left by the felons after every assize, ought to be immediately burned, or rather buried; as they only serve to harbour vermin, dirt, and infection.

* The occasion of my visit at this time, to this and two or three other prisons, was, that I had seen on board the hulks a few days before, several sickly objects, who told me they had lately come from this and other gaols; which, by the looks of those convicts, I was persuaded must be in a bad state. I was sorry to find them confirm my suspicions, that our gaols are verging to their old state. Without much additional and unremitting care, the benefits produced of late years by attention to this object, will prove merely temporary.

† During the assize at Croydon the prisoners are confined in two stables at the Three Tuns.

St. GEORGE'S FIELDS. Built 1772. Separate wards and courts for men and women. In the men's ward, two rooms, and a workshop (about 20 feet square) below; and three rooms above: in one of these were beds at 2s. 6d. a week. The women's ward had below, one room, and a work (hop (about 20 feet square) and three rooms above: in one of them beds at 2s. 6d. a week. There was a separate room for faulty apprentices. All the rooms were planked. Window shutters, and iron bars: no glass. There was no infirmary. In March 1776, I saw several sick on the floors: the county allows no bedding nor straw. In April, only one sick, on a bed which he paid for. In December, a woman sick on the floor. The rooms were dirty: in two or three of them were fowls. Prisoners allowance, three halfpence a day in bread (weight Dec. 1776, and Aug. 1779, 17oz.). No firing. The fines or convicts were with the other prisoners, and had the same allowance. They all were entirely without employment. Keeper a sheriff's officer: salary, £25: licence for beer and wine. The clauses against spirituous liquors, and the act for preserving the health of prisoners, were both hung up.

Of the twenty-nine prisoners in Dec. 1776, were, four women sentenced for ten years, one woman for three years, three men for three years, four men for two years, three men for one year.

In the men's court there was a board, on which was painted as follows:

On the discharge of every prisoner committed - 0 4 2

No garnish to be taken from one prisoner to another by order of the keeper.

N. B. This prohibition was disregarded.

This prison was burnt by the rioters in 1780, and (as appears by the inscription in front) rebuilt in 1781. It is nearly on the same plan. In the men's court there are-now added four rooms, planked round (9 feet 8 inches by 5½ feet, and 7 feet 4 inches, high), very proper for the separation of the drunken and riotous. In each of the work-rooms (so called) there is a chimney. There are now two rooms for faulty apprentices. No bath. — Bread allowance, weight, Dec. 1782, 13oz. Aug. 1783, 14oz. and Oct. 29th 14½oz. Keeper now no licence. At my late visits the prison was very dirty, and the prisoners still without employment*. At night they are crowded into one or two rooms, as all the upper rooms are kept for the few that can pay for beds. — I released a young man for his fees (4s. 2d.).

KINGSTON upon Thames. This bridewell, built in 1775, has a house for the keeper; and separate wards for men and women; with separate courts, work-shops, pumps, &c. Each ward has two lower rooms, three steps above the ground; and two chambers. The men's rooms are near 17 feet by 14, and full 9 feet high: the women's, about 15 feet square. Every room planked round: a chimney in each; and two windows, with shutters and iron bars, no glass

* If the great quantities of old cables and ropes piled up at the Tower were delivered,out to the several keepers of bridewells in and about London to be wrought for use, and prompt payment made for the work, this would prevent the excuses of keepers for not employing their prisoners. — See a similar mode in Holland, where the Admiralty and India Company find the old cords, and take the oakum when fit for use: a note in page 61.

The men's court 59 feet by 50: the women's, 46 by 36. There is also a room quite separate for faulty apprentices; about 8 feet by 11, and full 8 feet high; it has a fire-place.

It is pity that to a prison in some respects so commodious, the gentlemen did not add an infirmary and a bath. Using any of the rooms for the purpose of the sick, will not prevent the communication of small-pox, &c. Surgeon's salary, £10: 10: 0, of which £5: 5: 0 is for travelling charges to report at the quarter sessions the state of the prisoners.

County allowance, a three halfpenny loaf a day (weight in 1779, 17oz. and a quarter; in 1782, 12oz. in 1783, 140oz.). No bedding. In 1776, they were at work, beating hemp. The keeper has the profit of it, and a salary of £25. In 1779, the act for preserving the health of prisoners was hung up, though but little attention is paid to it. On the bottom of the board was also painted, "N. B. The fees for each person are 3s. 4d." — Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. The prison was dirty, and the prisoners unemployed; the keeper informing me that they were not committed for hard labour, though some were imprisoned for a year.

One of the prisoners who was committed for bastardy, not finding sureties, had been sent back hither, from the preceding quarter sessions at Ryegate; where there is no prison. I had heard of the hardships suffered by prisoners when conveyed for trial to such towns; and inquired of this man, what was his situation at Ryegate? He said that "he and fifteen others were confined there two or three days in a very small room; and almost suffocated." The keeper who was present confirmed the fact.

In 1782, I found the prison very dirty, and the prisoners still without employment. As the county allows no firing, bedding or bedsteads, many were lying sick on the floors. One woman was in a bed on the men's-side and two women in the room for faulty apprentices, but they pay for this privilege. — As I had been the preceding morning at Horsham gaol, where proper humanity is shewn even to felons, I was the more struck at seeing the wretched condition of these prisoners. There is a door from the men's court into that of the women's, and one of the men keeps the key, and can let any of the prisoners into the women's apartments. At my last visit, no alteration.

Quarter sessions are held Lady-Day at Ryegate, Midsummer at Guildford, Michaelmas at Kingston, Christmas at St. Margaret's Hill.

GUILDFORD BRIDEWELL, in 1776, had four rooms, besides the infirmary (lately a stable) and the condemned room. Yet when the assize is held here, and prisoners are brought from Southwark, it is much crowded. But in 1779, three new rooms up stairs had been lately added, and sewers below. A court, for the rise of which every prisoner pays entrance-money one shilling. Here is but one day-room for men and women (10 feet 2 inches by 7 feet) which is the only room that has a chimney. Two rooms have in the roof an iron-grate lattice, about 5 feet by 4, and an open turret above; very useful for freshening those rooms.

In the interval of my first and second visit, six or seven died of the gaol-distemper. At my visits in 1776, after the appointing Mr. Ludgate, all the prisoners were well. In 1779, two men sentenced for three years had continued here two years and a half; one of them was much emaciated by confinement without work*. At my last visit five were fines, one for seven years, another for three. No infirmary. Divine service is performed in the shire-hall which joins to the prison. A table of fees is now

[Remarks.]

IN this prison there is on the first floor, a day-room for debtors, which is used as a chapel, and four lodging-rooms: for felons, on the ground-floor, two day-rooms, one for men, and the other for women, without fire-places, and two cells for the condemned. The rooms are 8½ feet high: two dungeons, down eleven steps, one of them dark; the window of the other 18 inches by 12. Five pounds a year is allowed to the gaoler for straw, which is not on the floors, but on frames or bedsteads. The justices in winter, upon application, grant coals both to debtors and felons. The court is common to both. No apartment for the gaoler.

Clauses of the act against spirituous liquors are not hung up. I was, when sheriff, culpably ignorant of that act. No infirmary nor bath. About twenty years ago the gaol-fever was in this prison: some died there, and many in the town; among whom was Mr. Daniel the surgeon, who attended the prisoners. His successor, Mr. Gadsby, judiciously changed the medicines from sudorifics (generally used before) to bark and cordials: and a sail-ventilator being soon after put up, the gaol has been free from the fever almost ever since.

This prison is kept very clean; but the act for preserving the health of prisoners is not hung up.

Near it is a day-room for felons: and down 9 steps a dungeon for men-felons; in which is a small condemned room. In another place, down 7 steps, is a dungeon for women-felons: the floor of it level with the court; in which is the bridewell. This has two rooms below for men; and two above for women. No chimneys. The prison and court are too small: but I always found the whole remarkably clean, except at my visit in 1779. Clauses against spirituous liquors hung up. The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. No infirmary. No bath. Salary for the bridewell, £24: 16: 0; for the town gaol, £4. — Straw, £4: 16: 0 a year.

I was sorry to hear at my visit in 1776, that Mr. Brock, the late chaplain, who officiated very constantly twice a week, and had a salary of only £20, was dismissed. He would have continued his attendance, without the salary; but an order was made expressly forbidding it.

At the back of the prison a hemp-dresser has a small house, and also a salary of £11 a year, to find work for the prisoners in the bridewell, in beating hemp at three pence a stone.

There is an ascent of 22 stone steps on the outside to the debtors apartments, called the high-gaol. On the first floor is a room for the turnkey; a large kitchen; and two or three other rooms.

Town Bridewell. On the ground-floor, one room for men, 21 feet by 6; and two lodging-rooms for women, 9 feet by 5. In these are lately put bedsteads for straw or coverlets. There is a dungeon or dark room for the refractory. Above is a work-room 19 feet square, for women. In the spring 1779, seventeen women were confined in the day-time, and some of them at night, in this room, which has no fire-place or sewer. This made it extremely offensive, and occasioned a fever or sickness among them, which alarmed the Vice-chancellor, who ordered all of them to be discharged. Two or three died within a few days. — There are now added two rooms, in one of which are five cages about 7 feet square. There is a small court; no water.

The Vice-chancellor's prisoners, have four pence on Sunday, to prevent the necessity of their working on that day as formerly. Those of them, that are ill, have three pence a day. No allowance of bread for town prisoners. Keeper's salary, £30: no fees. Straw, £1: 1: 0 a year.

The bridewell stands in the back yard of the keeper's house; which was bought and endowed for the encouragement of wool-combers and spinners of this town. The basis of the institution was a legacy of the famous carrier Thomas Hobson, who died 1630. To answer the intention, the keeper appointed is a wool-comber. He employs not only several hands upon the foundation of the charity, but many others; among them his prisoners. His salary is paid out of the charity.

THIS gaol, the property of the bishop, who is lord of the franchise of the isle of Ely, was in part rebuilt by bishop Mawson in 1768, upon complaint of the cruel method which, for want of a safe gaol, the keeper took to secure his prisoners*.

For master's-side debtors three rooms up stairs: a room on the same floor for condemned felons. Below stairs is the felons day-room and their cell or night-room, 18½ feet by 10, with a window about a foot square. There is a court for felons, with an offensive sewer. No water. — For debtors a court with a pump; but no free ward. No infirmary. No straw. Clauses against spirituous liquors, and act for preserving the health of prisoners, not hung up. Keeper, a sheriffs officer for the isle, and for the county of Cambridge. No table of fees.

Assize in this isle, of late, twice a year, viz. Lent at Ely, Summer at Wisbech.

* This was by chaining them down on their backs upon a floor, across which were several iron bars; with an iron collar with spikes about their necks, and a heavy iron bar over their legs. An excellent magistrate, James Collyer, Esq. presented an account of the case, accompanied with a drawing, to the king; with which his majesty was much affected, and gave immediate orders for a proper inquiry and redress.

[Remarks.]

THE castle is situated on the summit of a hill. That part which is called the upper gaol, has ten rooms for master's-side debtors; and leads for them to walk on. The low gaol has several rooms for debtors, felons &c. A small area in the middle of the gaol, in which are made some improvements; such as a pump, a bath, and some rooms over it. There is a dungeon down a ladder of 8 steps, for men-felons; in which has been sometimes an inch or two of water: here are now barracks and mats. Only a small room for women-felons; and they cannot be separate from the men, when decency would most of all require it. There are three airy rooms for the sick; so distinct from the rest of the prison, that there is no danger of spreading any infection from thence. The gaoler is humane, and respected by his prisoners. These, felons as well as debtors, sell at the grates of their separate day-rooms, laces, garters, purses, nets, &c. of their own making.

There is a nurse or matron to attend the sick; and provide for them, when the surgeon orders it, broth, gruel, milk-pottage and extra-firing. It is also her

business to see that the prisoners be duly served with their allowance of bread, which is remarkably good. The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. At Lent assize, prisoners are moved from hence to Thetford*; and put into a dungeon which is described in that place. In 1779, twenty-seven prisoners, and in 1782, eighteen were carried thither, and confined four nights, most of them in the dungeon.

Mrs. Frances Kempe formerly bequeathed certain charities to the poor of Norwich and Heyden; and a stipend for preaching three sermons a year. For payment, she bound an estate in Heyden left her by her father John Mingay, Esq. Among the charities were some to prisoners in this castle, and in the city gaol. These have for some years past received nothing; although the legacies are paid to the other objects.

Here I would just mention the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, built in 1771, as being one of the best of our county hospitals. The wards are lofty; there is only one floor up stairs: the bedsteads are iron, and they are not crowded. The beds are straw, the furniture linen; and there are no tellers. The wards are kept clean by frequent washing, and airy by the opposite windows being generally open. There are Dutch stoves in the wards in summer, and little coppers for tea water, with which the patients are sometimes properly indulged. There is a fine area enclosed, in which the patients walk. There is no washing, brewing nor baking in this house.

Court enlarged, now 28 feet square, but no pump. A window in the keeper's kitchen which overlooked the court is improperly stopped up: the prisoners are confined to their rooms.

WYMUNDHAM. A day-room; with three closets on one side of it, for night-rooms, about 6 feet by 4. A prisoner complained to me of being obliged to lie in one of these closets, with two boys who had a cutaneous disorder. There is another room for women, in which, at my visit in 1779, there were four dirty and sickly objects at work with padlocks on their legs, though they are never out in the court except on Sundays. The very small quantity of straw on the floor was worn almost to dull. There is a dungeon down eight steps with the stocks in it. It is 15½ feet by 8, and 6 feet high; now arched with brick; a dirt floor; has two apertures at the top, of a foot diameter. The justices seem to have overlooked a clause in a late act of parliament (14th Geo. III. Chap. XLIII.) "to prevent the prisoners from being kept under ground, whenever they can do it conveniently," as there is abundant room on the premises. Neither the rooms nor the spacious court secure. Prisoners in this bridewell are not only confined within doors, but generally in irons. Keeper's salary, £16: no fees. Allowance to those suspected of felony, four pence a day. Straw, £1: 1; 0 a year. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up.

this I found in 1782, one or two court of confidence debtors *. The felons dungeons, or night-rooms, are down eleven steps; one of them quite dark , the other aim oft so. The women's dungeon down ten steps, has a fire-place: but at my late visits they had another night-room, about iod-feet by 5!, and but 5 feet high. Straw was-only:1: 0 a year, but now:10: 0. — Coals two chaldron. The keeper's stable adjoining to the last room, would make the women a good day-room; for there is no proper separation, which is peculiarly necessary in those places where the assize is but once a year. — The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up.

In 1779 there were many alterations. The court paved; and some old sheds, that, were in it, taken down. Three night-rooms or cells for felons, about three feet below the ground, eight feet square, planked all over. A bath, but not convenient: and over it two rooms for debtors. Over them two airy rooms for the sick (each 22 feet by 16, and near 12 feet high), with iron bedsteads, and bedding.

Gaol-delivery once a year: three prisoners were confined from eight to ten months before their trial; as two were committed November 6, 1778, and one woman August 22, 1778.

In these, and in the other rooms, are cribs. But it is to be hoped the gentlemen, who have made many improvements in their gaol, will be so considerate as to order these cells to be barred to all, unless to such as are very refractory and disobedient. — Only one court: river, and pump water. Allowance two pennyworth of bread daily, two hot dinners in a week, and firing from Michaelmas to Lady-day. The sick have four pence a day and firing when wanted.

THIS is also the town gaol: yet only one court-yard. — For debtors, a kitchen, or day-room; and several chambers: one of these is lately made a free ward. — For felons a day-room: and for the men a strong night-room; with beds well contrived for cleanliness and health. Each prisoner has a crib-bedstead, 10 or 12 inches high; the head raised a few inches; strong feet, low sides. These are easily moved when the ward is to be washed. The county allows to each crib a straw bed, and a blanket. — The women have no separate day-room: and their ward, or night-room, has no fireplace. — One of the two drinking-rooms is called the garnish-room. — Two rooms for the sick; not distinct enough from the rest. No bath. Debtors weave in hand-frames, like those at Lincoln, good garters, &c. and make purses, nets and laces which they sell at the front grate. I found this close prison clean, though full of prisoners. The water from the pump is conveyed through the sewers, which prevents the court-yard, which is small, from being offensive.

In the centre of the ceiling of a neat chapel lately built, is an aperture covered by a small turret, which keeps the room airy and pleasant. (All prison chapels should be thus supplied with fresh air *.) Mr. Brome, the chaplain, does not content himself merely with the regular and punctual performance of his stated duty; he is a friend to the prisoners on all occasions.

Assize always at Bury: there is now an allowance to the gaoler for conveying prisoners thither. Gaoler, a sheriff's officer. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is not hung up.

Debtors have on Sunday from a legacy of Mr. John Pemberton, each 1½lb. of beef for broth, a penny loaf, and a pint of ale. The following memorial of this kind donation is now hung up in the chapel.

July 17, 1780.

At this, the annual meeting of the trustees of Mr. Pemberton's, charity, it is ordered, that the treasurer should provide as the trustees shall see fit, for the debtors imprisoned in any of the jails in the county of Suffolk, either for their relief therein, by a proportion of bread, meat, and beer, as he shall think necessary, or for the delivering them out of prison, until the treasurer shall receive further orders. — Nevertheless, such debtors in Ipswich jail, as do not regularly attend divine service (unless prevented by sickness, or some reasonable cause, to be allowed of by the chaplain), and behave decently and reverently, shall not have any benefit or allowance from this charity.

Trustees,

Geo. Drury. Lott Knight. Ph. B. Brooke, Edwd. Hasell.

From another legacy the town supplies them with five chaldron of coals yearly. No memorial of this in the gaol.

IPSWICH. On the ground-floor is a workshop; and a night-room for men: up stairs a night-room for women. None of them, nor the court secure. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. Keeper, a worsted manufacturer: salary. No fees. Prisoners, no allowance. Employment, spinning worsted, and turning a twilling-mill.

The above was the state of the prison in 1776, but at my visit in 1779, I found it greatly improved. The two work-rooms and chambers now are 20 feet by 14. The court 40 feet by 34.

LAVENHAM. A work-room below :a chamber for men; only one room for women: none of them secure. The prison is out of repair. At a former visit I heard that a prisoner had escaped, for which the keeper was fined, though the neglect lay in the magistrates. Two more, lately escaped through the plaster wall. Prisoners always kept within doors; the court not secure: no water: no straw. Keeper's salary, £ 15: 14: 8. No fees. Employment, spinning wool. There is no proper separation of female prisoners. An old out-house and stable of the keeper's might be made convenient for them. — At my last visit, I found the magistrates had sent to the keeper a number of thumb-screws for securing prisoners.

BURY St. EDMUND'S GAOL.

This prison for the franchise or liberty of Bury St. Edmund's, is the property of Sir Charles Davers. The court is spacious, but not secure: at my visit in 1779, they were repairing it, and making it secure by chevaux de frise: none had the use of it without paying a shilling a week. On one side of it are several rooms for debtors: one of them is a work-room. On the other side, is a large dungeon down three steps; which is the day and night-room for felons: the men are chained to staples fixed in the barrack-bedsteads. No straw. There is another dungeon down a step or two; seldom used. No proper separation of men and women-felons. The late gaoler told me that in the winter of 1773, five died of the small-pox. No apothecary then;

The work-house, or house of industry for this psrish, situated near the church, was one of the cleaned: I ever saw. Here were upwards of forty persons at my first visit, and at my last visit sixty. nine, whose countenances bespoke their satisfaction and the attention paid to them. If all the parishes had been as careful to promote cleanliness and industry in their own work-houses, there would have been no occasion for parishes uniting in houses of industry, most of which I have visited in this and the adjoining county.

In a Description of Bury printed 1771, there is an account of several ancient donations and bequests to prisoners. Whether they be now totally funk, or the coals be from some of them, T cannot say. — A poor widow of eighty years of age, committed March 6, 1780, for a fine of ^5, was here at my last visit.

At assize, twice a year, prisoners of both sexes brought from Ipswich, are confined four or five nights in the dungeon here described.

ONE court for debtors, and men-felons. Women-felons have a separate court, day-room, and two small night-rooms (7 feet 10 inches by 6 feet 8), aperture only 7 inches by 6. They used to be loaded with irons-, now they have none. Men-felons have a day-room: their night room is in an o&agonal dungeon about 21 feet diameter, down 31 steps; damp and offensive: the gaoler on going down took a preservative. Two cells in another dungeon for the condemned. Prisoners are tried in the county clothing: there are twelve suits for men, and six for women*.

Debtors common day-room is the hall, which is also used as a chapel. For master's-side, ten or twelve rooms, some of them the Rooks Nest, where also is the free ward. All the debtors rooms were very dirty. — No infirmary: no bath. The late gaoler Mr. Roe (uncle to the present) died in 1772, of the gaol distemper; and so did some of his prisoners. No water then, but now plenty. The felons allowance of bread is judiciously fixed by weight, not variable with the price.

* See a better practice at Reading in Berkshire.

308 WARWICKSHIRE. Midland Circuit.

[Warwick County Gaol.]

Debtors have in common from a legacy thirty shillings a year; and from another legacy eight three-penny loaves twice every month. No memorial of either hung up in the gaol.

The justices of this county have taken the gaol and bridewell under consideration, and propose that debtors and felons, and also men and women, in both, shall be entirely separated. A chapel and infirmary also are designed. May it not be hoped that gentlemen so considerate will not continue the damp and offensive dungeon which has only an aperture level with the court, 3 feet diameter? — In 1782, many rooms for debtors were finished, which open into passages only three feet wide. It seems by what is done, that the plan is adapted more for shew than for security, healthy or convenience.

There, were hung up in the debtors hall, some rules against profaneness, rioting and drunkenness, with penalties annexed; but I was sorry to find among them that "Every debtor at his or her first coming mud pay for garnish, 2s. 6d."

At my last visit, I was informed there had been no divine service except to the condemned, for near two years.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at WARWICK.

[Bridewell.]

This prison, the only county bridewell, is too small. For men, a work-room (19 feet by 16) and two lodging-rooms. For women, two rooms in a little separate court. No water: the handle of the pump is on the outside of the wall. The whole prison close and offensive: might be enlarged on the ground adjacent. Allowance, one pound and a half of bread a day. Keeper's salary now, £40: fees 4s. 8d. table now hung up. Clauses against spirituous liquors hung up. Mr. Mussen (chaplain to the county goal) formerly read prayers here once a week.

[Remarks.]

THIS gaol, built about 1772, is in a close part of the city. I was shewn a fine spot which some gentlemen very judiciously preferred. It has eight lodging rooms for master's-side debtors; and the common ward. Women-felons have only one room, and that without a fire-place. The men have a day-room. To their dungeons there is a descent of 12 steps to a passage only feet wide: the four dungeons are about 9 feet by 6: at the upper corner of each, a little window, 11 inches by 7. All are very damp, dirty and offensive: we went down with torches. Only one court for all prisoners. No straw: no infirmary: no bath. Rooms might be made for criminals in the area where the old county-hall stood; in which case, the horrid dungeons need not be used, and the sexes might be separated. Neither clauses against spirituous liquors, nor the act for preserving the health of prisoners, are hung up.

One of the felons, James Ward, received his majesty's pardon, on condition of his going to sea. Mr. Francis Waters, clerk of the assize, wrote in the letter which enclosed the pardon (which was dated August 25, 1781), "The secretary of state's fee is £ 1: 7: 0 and my fee £1: 1: 0. which you'll take care to receive on the back of the pardon from the officer who receives him." As no officer would

take him on condition of paying this, together with 19s. 4d. the gaoler's and under-sheriff's fees, I found the poor wretch in May 1782, languishing in prison on his pound of bread a day.

BIRMINGHAM TOWN GAOL.

[Birmingham Town Gaol.]

The gaol for this large populous town is called the Dungeon. The court is about 25 feet square. Keeper's house in front; and under it two cells down 7 steps: the straw is on bedsteads. On one side of the court two night rooms for women, 8 feet by 5 feet 9 inches; and some rooms over them: on the other side is one small day-room for men and women, and the gaoler's stable (from which the litter is flung into the court): above was a free ward for court of conscience debtors, a sizeable room, with only one window 18 inches square. Over it is another room, or two.

At some particular times here are great numbers confined. Once in the winter 1775 there were above 150, who by the care of the magistrates had a supply of proper food, broth, &c. In November 1782 I found thirty-nine persons who had been apprehended the preceding night by a search-warrant, but most of them were discharged that morning. — Allowance, 4d. a day in bread and cheese. Licence for beer: fees, 2s. no table. Neither clauses against spirituous liquors, nor act for preserving the health of prisoners, are hung up.

FOR master-side debtors nine or ten rooms. Day-room common. The free ward, the cellar, is a dungeon, 29½ feet by 9, and 6 feet 8 inches high, down 7 steps and damp†; two windows; the largest about 15 inches square. Felons day and night-rooms are dungeons from 5 to 7 steps under-ground. They sleep on thick mats on the floor; which, if cribs and coverlets were added, would be better than straw. The whole close and offensive. Court small, 36 feet by 17 feet inches. No chapel. Two rooms lately built for an infirmary: but the gaol is not convenient or healthy. In 1774, three debtors and a felon died of the small-pox. Of that disease I was informed few ever recover in this gaol. The castle-hill is near the shire-hall, and is a fine spot for air and water.

* See page 26.

† This seems to be the low moist dungeon that was complained of by a debtor in this gaol, in his Letter 13th Nov. 1690, sent to Moses Pitt, a prisoner in the Fleet; who printed it, with other letters from prisoners, in his Cry of the Oppressed 1691. By this, and one or two more of the letters in that little tract, it appears that some inconveniences which I observed in gaols, and have set down in my remarks, are of long standing.

314 LEICESTERSHIRE. Midland Circuit.

[Leicester County Gaol.]

Clauses of the act against the use of spirituous liquors painted on the same board as the table of fees. The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. Here, as in many other gaols, is an useless tub, instead of a bath for cleanliness and health*. An inscription on a board is fixed over the gate, "No money to be asked for by turnkeys or prisoners, for garnish or any other pretence whatever."

In this county they make an annual collection by a kind of voluntary brief. The gentlemen of the grand jury recommend it to the clergy: most of whom promote the collection in their respective parishes. The thanks of the grand jury to forty-eight clergymen by name, were inserted in the Leicester Journal of Feb. 16th 1775; for the satisfaction of those gentlemen and other contributors. There is a table of the sum received from each parish; and a list of debtors clothed or discharged; and an account of the expenditure of the remainder in feeding and warming all the prisoners in the inclement season. The collections in 1774 amounted to £74. I found in 1776 the accounts were kept, and the application of the money chiefly directed by John Simpson, Esq. of Leicester. I wish every county would imitate this exemplary benevolence: and I wish every county that does so, a steward equally faithful and assiduous. — I am sorry to find the collection fall short. It amounted in 1779 only to £12: 5: 6; — in 1780, to £6: 1: 9; — and in 1781, to £3: 18: 0.

* In my prisons I have mentioned that there is no bath, though baths are ordered in all gaols in the Act for preserving the health of prisoners. I would here also remind gentlemen, that when baths are provided in compliance with the act, if they be not made convenient, so that felons in their irons may commodiously use them; and if there is no allowance for soap and towels; these prisoners will receive little or no benefit from them, and will never bathe but when actually compelled.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

[Bridewells.]

LEICESTER. Three rooms below for men: five above for women; one of these not used, because not secure. No chimneys. Court not safe for prisoners to be allowed the use of it. Allowance now, two pennyworth of bread a day, after month's confinement. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. There was painted on a board, "By order of the Court at Easter Sessions 1778, that there shall be no ale or beer brought into this Prison on a Sunday, nor after Seven o'clock in the Evening on a week-day."

In a former edition I suggested, that if a wall were built with brick, instead of the clay-wall, there would be no need of a chain and log, to secure the prisoners in the court. The apartments also would be more airy, and men and women might be separated, if the narrow court were enlarged from the orchard, which was let by the keeper for £6 per annum.

At my last visit, I found the court enlarged, and a wall built; but there is not a proper separation of men and women. The prisoners now are without the chain. This prison is white-washed once a year; and kept remarkably neat and clean. The prisoners do not lie on the floors, but very properly their mats are on cribs or bedsteads. Keeper a wool-comber, his salary £21: he pays window-tax 14s.

Committed from Easter Sessions 177910 1780, prisoners forty-four — from 1780 to 1781, fifty-nine — and from 1781 to 1782, forty-eight.

[Remarks.]

THIS gaol, built in 1757, is in an airy healthy situation. — The debtors court and ward very properly separate from those for felons, but not from the bridewell. The debtors floors are bad tarras, not easily washed. The windows in general too small and close glazed. — The bridewell, in the debtors court, has a large work-room, and two lodging-rooms for women, and also the condemned room. — The gaoler has £ % o a year as keeper of the bridewell, and £10 in lieu of transports. — In the felons court there is for men a day-room, and down 3 steps a dungeon, 23^ feet diameter: for women a day-room, and two small night-rooms; the latter are too close, 74 feet square. A neat chapel, but the ceiling too low:a bath; prisoners wash in it before assize and quarter sessions: a copper just by to warm the water. — Above are two rooms for an infirmary. There is also a new room or parlour at the keeper's house, with windows to the felons court." this circumstance keeps them quiet and orderly. The county allows eight guineas a year for straw.

A person goes round the county about Christmas to gentlemen's houses, and begs for the debtors. He carries a book, in which the giver enters Jhis name, and donation. The whole amount, generally about ^14.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at CHESTERFIELD;

This house, given, as I was informed, to the county for a bridewell, was built in 1614. For men, a room or cellar 17 feet square under the keeper's house; down 8 steps; but level with the ground behind it: provision generally put through a hole in the floor, 6 inches square. A room for women up stairs. No straw. Nothing allowed by the county for conveyance to quarter sessions. Keeper's salary, now £1 o. No fees: no allowance: no employment. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. A court is now made from one of the keeper's gardens; and there is a cellar for the women, of the same dimensions as that for the men, in which I saw a sick object* committed for bastardy*.

I am apprized, that by an act (7th James, c. 4.) justices of the peace are. empowered to commit lewd women to the house of correction, there to be confined and set to labour, for the term of one whole year; but the woman is not to be apprehended till the child-be born, and Ihe has recovered her strength..See Dale. c. 11. Burn, p. 207.

Before this rigorous law is put in execution, however, gentlemen would do well to inquire whether overseers of the poor have not procured such warrants only to fa'tie parish expences; and for that purpose, aggravated the crime and misrepresented the condition of the culprit. In the present instance, and in too many others which I have known, I believe this to have been the case; and that much cruelty has been exercised both on the mother and child, by a commitment of the woman to her miserable habitation, while yet in a very weak state,

CHESTERFIELD Gaol, For the hundred of Scarsdale, is the property of the duke of Portland; to whom, or to his steward, the gaoler pays ^18: 12: 0 a year. Only one room with a cellar under it; to which the prisoners occasionally defeend through a hole in the floor. The cellar had not been cleaned for many months. The prison-door had not been opened for several weeks, when I was there first. There were four prisoners, who told me they were almost starved: one of them said, with tears in his eyes, " he had not eaten a morsel that day; " it was afternoon. Their meagre sickly countenances confirmed what they said. They had borrowed a book of Dr. Minton's; one of them was reading it to the rest. Each of them had a wife; and they had in the whole thirteen children, cast on their respective parishes. Two had their groats from the creditors; and out of that pittance they relieved the other two. No allowance: no straw: no firing: water a halfpenny for about three galions, put in (as other things are) at the window. Gaoler a bailiff, lives distant. I found in this prison a strong bedstead, which had been compassionately left by a poor prisoner, that it might be some relief to his unhappy successoi s.

This deserter had been before confined here for desertion, his brother was in another prison for the same offence; they followed the example of their father, who was a deserter, and was afterwards transported; and their grandfather was a dragoon, who deserted with his horse and accoutrements, and was never taken. The keeper's mother, who was a near neighbour to the grandfather, was my informant.

THE gaol is on the side of a hill. For master's-side debtors only three rooms. Down 28 steps are two rooms for criminals who can pay, and a condemned room. Down 12 steps more are deep dungeons, cut in the sandy rock, very damp: one of which is 23 feet by 13, and 7 feet high: another, nearly circular, is about 12 feet diameter: the straw on barrack-beds.

At my last visit, the felons court was more airy, the wall being palifacted; they had both well and river water 5 and there was an entire separation of debtors and felons. — > The women have one bed, in a room in the turnkey's lodge. When there are more than two women, they are at night in one of the dungeons.

For bathing here is (not, as in moil other county gaols, an inconvenient and almost useless tub — but) a large and commodious bath, supplied with river wateri and a copper just by, to warm it when necessary. The infirmary is near it, which has two rooms. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is neatly painted over the keeper's door. The justices have allowed the gaoler to supply the sick with better nourishment, &c. to

the amount of seven shillings a week. Gentlemen so remarkably considerate and humane will, I hope, abolish the unwholesome dungeons.

The prisoners have the choice of wheaten or household bread; the weight of the former, three fourths of the latter.

Transports condemned at assizes had, with the king's allowance of two shillings and six pence a week, the county-bread.

Here (as at Derby) a man goes round the county about Christmas, and begs at gentlemen's houses for the debtors. He carries a book, and gentlemen write in it their names, and donations. The amount, about £30 a year; in 1781 it was £34.

No chapel. Service is performed in a parlour, which is too small.

Prisoners are tried in clothes provided for that purpose by the county*.

In the account sent up to London of transports in this gaol in 1776, was one William Berks. This man obtained his majesty's pardon. Mr. Francis Waters, clerk of assize, in his letter sent with the pardon, charges state office fees £ I -.7: 6, my fees £ 1: 7: 8. For these, and the gaol fees, the pardoned criminal was detained in prison.

Nottinghamshire. A Table of the several Gifts, Legacies and Bequests — for the benefit — of poor Prisoners in the common Gaol of this County, as settled by us his Majesty's Justices of the Peace — this 18th day of Jan. 1760. Pursuant to the late Act of Parliament and according to the bell information we can get, as follows.

By John Sherwin Esq. of Nottingham, the yearly sum of four pounds, paid quarterly out of an estate at Bramfcoti, in this county, purchased by Mr. Sherwin's father of some of the descendants of Henry Handley Esq. who left this charity.

By Abel Smith Esq. of Nottingham, pursuant to the directions of the will of Mr. Abel Collings deceased, four shillings monthly for coals for the prisoners.

We are informed that forty shillings a year, was formerly left by some of the family of Hutchinson,

Esquire. But that the prisoners have not received the same for these twenty years past.

We do not know of any other gifts, legacies, or bequests, except the general collection made in the county for the prisoners every Christmas.

We order this table to be transmitted to the deputy clerk of the peace for this county, to be entered among the rolls of the felGons, and copies thereof to be made and hung up by him in the respective courts, where the general quarter sessions are held — there to remain and be inspected — And also to cause another copy — to be transmitted to the keeper of the said gaol to be forthwith hung up by him there, in some public place, and in a conspicuous manner, — so as the prisoners may have free resort thereto, at all seasonable times in the day time, without paying any thing for the same.

[Remarks.]

THE castle belongs to the duchy of Lancaster. The county pays ten shillings a year. The gaoler, per contract, to keep it in repair. A spacious area of near seven acres. (6 A. 3 R. 27 P.) On the ground-floor are the gaoler's apartments, the tap-room, &c.

For master's-side debtors, six sizeable rooms on the first story; and as many garrets. The floors of both stories are tarras, and cannot be kept clean: the passages six feet wide, with windows close glazed.

The free ward for debtors is only a room at the end of the building, down 2 steps. It is paved with small stones, and is a thorough-fare to sundry places. First, by

a trap-door in the said pavement there is a descent of 10 steps to two vaulted dungeons for criminals, 8 feet high; one, the Pit, 14 feet by 21, window 2 feet by 14 inches; the other, within it, the condemned cell, 14 feet by 7; window about 9 inches by 18: a little short straw on the floors: both dungeons offensive. — It is also a passage to the women-felons ward (which is 11 feet by 8); — and to the felons court (43 feet by 26½), and their sizeable day-room (15 feet by 19): no water: no sewer; — and to a room for the closer confinement of debtors who do not behave well. There are two rooms with beds for felons who can pay for them; to which there is another way.

No chapel: service is performed in the Shire-hall. No infirmary: no bath. The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. The whole prison is out of repair*; and never white-washed.

Mr. Wood, besides the forementioned articles of his contract, is to furnish his prisoners with pails, and other utensils, to the amount of £3 a year; and to pay yearly to prisoners in the King's Bench and Marshalsea, two guineas; all out of his salary of £154.

An order of the justices is hung up, that for a debtor's being admitted to county allowance, it is required that he produce a certificate of his poverty signed by the minister, churchwardens and overseers of his parish. The debtors make considerable quantities of garters, purses, &c. of a very good sort; most of which they weave in a cheap, but convenient hand-frame.

---

Mr. Simpsons salary, £5, is from a legacy of Thomas Hejleden; and for attending condemned criminals he has five guineas from the sheriff. Mr. Thomas Hejleden left also £3 a year, for the better maintenance of the poor prisoners in the castle. For the payment of these two legacies, he bound an estate called Works Chantry at Lincoln. His will was proved September 21, 1720.

Thomas Robert Jenkinson, by will (proved February 13, 1772,) left the interest of £120 to the debtors in this prison, to be equally divided among them annually on Easter Monday; with this provisoy that if the whole interest for one year is sufficient to discharge any one debtor, within fourteen days of the time of payment, the said sum shall be applied for that purpose, at the discretion of his trustees.

Rebecca Hujfey, by her will, proved in London 10th May 1715, bequeathed the interest of^ioooo. to release poor debtors from this castle: but no debtors have received the benefit for many years past f.

If the gentlemen should build a new gaol, it may be hoped it will be a more substantial building than the county hospital in this city, and not with such tarras floors.

t On a tomb-stone in the cathedral, is an inscription, noting that Clement Wood, interred there, was thirty-eight years gaoler of the castle, and of the city gaol.

Examined by Jofp. Peart Clerk of the peace.

On my observing to the keeper, how properly these clauses against spirituous liquors were hung up, he informed me, that both the debtors and felons used to be served with them from the public houses; but that upon having nearly loft his life from one of the felons who was intoxicated, he copied out the clauses from Burn, shewed them to the publicans, and thus put an end to the practice — When I have inquired, in similar prisons, whether these clauses were hung up ? the keepers have frequently replied. How is it possible for us to prevent liquors being handed in at the street windows

[Remarks.]

THIS is also the county bridewell and the town gaol; yet I found it twice empty. On the ground-floor is a day-room or kitchen for debtors: — a day-room, and two small vaulted night-rooms for felons; one of which being quite close (11 feet by 6 feet inches), the gaoler has made apertures in the door. — Up stairs are two rooms strongly planked with oak: in each of them are two beds, for those that pay.

There is a large work-room, but there were no rooms proper for the reparation of men and women, or of bridewell prisoners from felons. Lately one room has been fitted up in the barn for that purpose, with a chimney. The whole prison is thatched.

The felons court is parted off with strong wooden palisades; which intercepting the pump, the justices have been so considerate as to put down another pump in the felons court. They have also ordered the gaoler to provide some clothing for the most destitute prisoners. His salary as keeper of the bridewell is £20. No fable of fees. Act for preserving the health of prisoners, and clauses against spirituous liquors, not hung up.

THIS gaol is also the county bridewell; but petty offenders are kept separate from felons. Mr. Scofield had a salary of £36: 10: 0 as keeper, and now as gaoler he has £30 added. Three courts; but the two for felons are too close. No draw. The county have built seven commodious rooms (7 feet 9 inches by 6 feet), for felons; yet there are {till two horrid dungeons 11 steps under ground, over which is a day-room for felons, and the condemned room. — The bridewell part consists of one room, with a close bed-room, and a room over them, all made very offensive by a fewer. The prison was clean, and the gaoler attentive and humane to his prisoners. Debtors, felons, and petty offenders were at work, spinning, making pegs for shoe-makers, &c.

The chapel was the upper room in the gaoler's house, when it must have been painful for prisoners loaded with irons to go up and down the stairs; but now it is more conveniently situated. No infirmary, nor bath. The act for preserving the

READING.

The following verses are written over the debtors-grate to the street:

Oh ye whose hours exempt from sorrow flow,

Behold the seat of pain and want and woe:

Think, while your hands th' entreated alms extend.

That what to us ye give, to God ye lend.

[Remarks.]

---

THIS gaol is too small for the general number of prisoners. Debtors and felons have their courts separated only by iron rails. The former have a kitchen: and for the master's-side many rooms; and now a free ward. Felons, one day-room for men and women. The night-room for men is a large dungeon- down four steps: the prisoners broke out lately. A separate night-room for women. The turnkey has now a lodging-room, over the felons dungeon, with an alarm-bell; so that an escape will be more difficult. Near this is the condemned room (n feet by io). There is lately fitted up a small room for an infirmary; and another room or. two: but no provision made for separating men-felons at night, except the convicts,. who have now two rooms and a small court on the debtors side. Transports have not the king's allowance of is. 6d. a week. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up, Na straw: offensive sewers- The chapel is much too small. The act for preserving the health of prisoners was painted on a board in the debtors, court; and at my laffc visit, the rules and orders. At the Lent assize in 1782, none o$»the prisoners attended at church. I observed that the women were not only chained together by their hands, but had heavy irons also on their legs, as they were conducted to the sessions-house.

When felons come to this prison, they are washed,. and clothes provided by the county are put on. The men have a Russia-drab coat and breeches, a flannel waistcoat, two check shirts, and two pair of yarn hose the women, a linsey woolsey gown and petticoat, a flannel petticoat, two dowlas shists, two pair of yarn hose. Their own; clothes are ticketed and hung up till the quarter sessions or assizes; when they put them on again to appear in on trial. Afterwards the county-clothes are washed, mended, and purified in an oven, for the use of future criminals. The clothing aforesaid for twenty men and five women cost only £16 :.6: 8. — A gentleman sent to this gaol for the prisoners thirty-six rugs or coverlets which, are now worn out.

He also acquaints me with some alterations both here and at the gaol, which I hope may prove beneficial; but as I never mention any particulars except from my own inspection on the days marked for my several visits, I must beg to be excused from noticing them.

WINDSOR Castle Prison, for Debtors. I need not observe that his Majesty is proprietor. The duke of Montague is constable: he appoints a janitor with a salary: the janitor appoints a deputy, who for a house rent-free, and certain perquisites, does the duty. The prison out of repair. It consists of three rooms on the first floor and three rooms over them.

At my last visit I found that the old keeper had been murdered in the tap-room by a soldier, who also killed another, and was then shot himself. This is not the first instance I have known of persons being murdered in the tap-room of gaols. Such are the bad effects of selling liquors in prisons.

The preamble in the table of fees for the honour and castle of Windsor recites, "that complaint having been made to me of some abuses and irregularities committed in demanding and receiving fees — the table being defaced, so that the words and figures are hardly legible," &c. This table was made May 10th, the first year of George II. 1728, subscribed Carlisle. There seems the same ground of complaint with respect to the present table being defaced. As the fees are lower here than in most other prisons, the table should be preserved to prevent impositions.

[Remarks.]

FOR the castle gaol the county pays £40 a year to Mr. Etty3 who holds it of Christ church college on lease. Heitors apartments small; and not enow of them for the general number of prisoners. No free ward: for lodging even in the tower on their own beds they must pay is. 6d. a week: see the table. Their court is too small. Felons day-room or hall for men and women down 5 steps, 23 feet by 11, the men's dungeon (i8-| feet by 16\)y down 5 more; only small apertures: the women's night-room 6| feet by feet 2 inches. The court common to both, 29 feet by 23. The. gaoler has a spacious garden.

Since the north-gate was taken down, this prison has been also the City gaol: for which Mr. Wisdom has £$ a year. — In 1773, eleven died of the small-pox. In 1774, that distemper still in the gaol in 1775', one debtor died of it in May; three-debtors and a petty offender in June: three recovered. No infirmary: no bath: no straw: the prisoners lie in their clothes on mats. The men's dungeon swarms with vermin; yet not white-washed for many years. — Of the thirty-one felons &c» in 1782, fifteen were fines. — The act for preferring the health, of prisoners not

The warrant runs, cc As Royal Power ought not " to be wanting to the holy church in its complaints — attach — till she has made <c satisfaction to the holy church — as well for the contempt — as for the injury done xt unto it."

Thomas Horde, who was confined here for some offence against government, built the chapel. After his discharge, he had bequeathed £14 a year for a chaplain; and as much to the prisoners. But finding some difficulties would obstruct the execution of that bequest, he altered it, August 6th, 1709, to a legacy of £24 a year, to be distributed among prisoners of both forts, at £1 a month. For the payment, he bound an estate in Oxfordshire; and to make up any deficiency of that estate, he bound an estate in Berkshire. But this estate having been recovered against the charity since his death, the prisoners have now only thirty-three shillings a month, which was paid by the rector of Lincoln college, and is now paid by the principal of Trinity, who are always two of the twelve trustees. A memorial of the process and result of Mr. Horde's benevolent intention hangs up in the gaol. I have a copy of it; too long to transcribe.

There is another legacy to prisoners of both sorts; 8s. 8d. paid quarterly from Magdalen college. From which also in Lent there is about forty shillings, commonly called forfeit-money. Debtors have in common every Saturday six pounds of mutton; sent by a gentleman of Christ church college. From two other colleges they have in bread about is. a week. Christ church and New college send them broth; generally three times in a fortnight: the prisoners pay four pence to the man who brings it.

It is very probable, that the rooms in this castle are the same as the prisoners occupied at the time of the Black Assize. The wards, passages and staircases are close and offer.five; so that if crowded, I should not greatly wonder to hear of another fatal sfifvze at Oxford *. — At my last visit some of the debtors rooms were white-waftied.

Mr. Wisdom (the gaoler) told me (that some years ago, wanting to build a little hovel, and digging up Hones for the purpose, from the ruins of the court, which was formerly in the castle, he found under them a complete lkeleton with light chains on the legs; the links very small. These were, probably, the bones of a malefactor who died in court of the distemper at the Black Assize mentioned }age 9.

At several of my visits to this city, I walked over the County Ho/piiah, and as it is a modern Ihewy building, and may perhaps be taken as a model for others of the same kind, I hope to be excused in making a few remarks upon it. The stories are too low; the height of the lpftieft wards not being above fifteen feet. From this fault, and the closeness of the windows, which I always found shut, the wards, especially the men's, are offensive beyond conception. The sewers are not sufficiently attended to — the beds, improperly, have tellers — and the kitchen is not well placed. The fan-lights over the doors of the wards, in this, as in many other hospitals, are glazed. Were they open, it would greatly tend to purify ^jie air; or, at least, the noxious effluvia would become so sensible through the rest of the house, as. might induce the matron, and the gentlemen who only attend in the committee-room, to infijl upon effectual rtreans being used for a proper ventilation of the wards.

THAME. I was informed that this house, built in 1708, was given to the county for a bridewell \ but the greatest part of it is now a parish work-house. For the prison there is only left, up stairs, a common day-room, and two small insecure lodging-rooms: and down 11 steps a dungeon, in which, are three night-rooms,

the cubs, each 9 feet by 7. If the house was put into good repair, and the whole used as a bridewell, it would be a commodious one. Then there would be no need of sending petty offenders, as is now done, to the county gaol: nor of locking up all day those few that are committed hither, men and women in the same room: nor of confining either sex at night in the cubs. No allowance: no employment at my first visits, but in Feb. 1779, t^ie prisoners were carding and spinning: no water accessible to prisoners: no sewers. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. Keeper's salary, £16: fees, 4s. 6d. no table.

At my two first visits the keeper farmed the work-house and the rest of the poor at £480 a year for the whole maintenance, clothing, medicines, &c. At my two last visits, he farmed them at ,£500. In 1782, the prison was quite out of repair and insecure. — From Midsummer 1778 to Midsummer 1779, t^ie number committed to this prison was twenty-sixj — to 1780, ninej — to 1781, eighteen; — to 1782, fourteen.

WITNEY. One day-room (16 feet inches by 14 feet 4) for men and women: two night-rooms adjoining (9 feet 2 inches by 6 feet 7, and 6\ feet high); with only a grate of 9 inches square in each door. The prison is not secure. No allowance but to the sick, who have six-pence a day and medicines. No chimney: no straw: no water. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. Keeper's salary, £20: fees, 4s. id. no table.

At my last visit I found a room built for men 16 % feet by 12^, in which are two cells 7 feet by 4^ with apertures in the doors 9 inches square. Up stairs are two rooms for the sick (9 feet 2 inches by 8 feet 4, and 6 feet 5 inches high), with apertures in the doors of 14 inches by 12. No chimney.

The house does not belong to the county: the prison is in the court-yard of the keeper's house, for which he pays £14: 14: 0 a year. Prisoners have no use of the court; their window was formerly accessible to passengers. I then saw a crowd of men talking at the grate with the prisoners, who were all of them women; and was informed there was sometimes riot and confusion on such occasions.

At my visit in 1779, the prisoners were at work Pthe'keeper now is a manufacturer, and employs them. He pays them for their work, two pence a pouad for the chain, and three-halfpence for the Shoot so that each earns (as he said) about three pence a day.

THE Castle-yard is spacious: county members are chosen in it. In the gaoler's; house are eleven good lodging-rooms for master's-side debtors; and two small day-rooms; one of which is for common-side debtors: one of these was used, at my former visits, as a chapel; but now there is a larger and more convenient room for that purpose. The two free wards, or night-rooms for debtors, are at another partr of the yard. The way to them is through the women-felons night-room, which has no window. The day-room (called the round-house) for men and women-felons is in the middle of the area: only 14 feet by 12*. Near it is a hand-ventilator (which is kept in order for a guinea a year) for airing the men-felons dungeon, which is 26 steps under ground, and circular, 18 feet diameter, with barrack-bed heads. Over it is an aperture

The Magistrates may be fully convinced of the impropriety and shocking indecency of having only one day-room, if they examine the women lately sent from this gaol to the bridewell.

in the court, 3 feet diameter, with iron grates. The felons work the ventilator cheerfully about a quarter of an hour before they go down, and as long when they come up; for it freshens and cools the dungeon amazingly: we could hardly keep our candle burning below while it was working *. There is another very damp dungeon 154 feet square, the window (18 inches by 12) even with the ground. Straw, £4 a year. Excellent water at a pump in the yard.'No infirmary. Mr. Hallward the surgeon caught the gaol-fever some years ago, and has ever since been fearful of going into the dungeon: when any felon is sick there, he orders him to be brought out. The small-pox was in this gaol; and at my last visit I found the gaol-fever prevailing, which had carried off some of the prisoners, the gaoler, and Dr. Johnstone, a physician, whose humanity had led him to attend the prison f. Two rooms were taken from the bridewell for the sick, who lay in their clothes on straw. At my request, the irons of those who were ill were taken off.

The uneasy situation of the prisoners at night in the horrid dungeon, has, I doubt not, been one cause of their illness; for even in this strong and deep dungeon, prisoners (as in too many other gaols) are all night chained together, by a heavy chain through the links in their fetters and iron rings fattened to the floor.

There is now a useless tub lined with lead, called a bath. Such a bath as there is in the county infirmary, might save the lives of many prisoners.

The gaoler pays £z:19: 0 window tax. Clauses of act: against spirituous liquors not hung up. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is written on paper, and hung up.

This prison may be made commodious by separate wards, day-rooms, courts, &c. There is round it much ground belonging to the county.

The celebrated contrivance of Ventilators has been so little attended to in practice, that in all the prisons in this kingdom, there are but six of these machines; <viz. at Maidstone and Bedford, where they are worked with fails; at London bridewell, Worcester castle, Stafford, and Shewsbury; and the two latter have not been used for many years path This sufficiently shews, how liable any new regulation is to fall into neglect, if not constantly the object of care and attention. With respect to ventilators, however, I am now fully confirmed in an opinion I have long entertained, that they are inadequate to the purpose of preventing, and (till more of eradieating, the gaol-distemper, while the use of dungeons is continued.

t A letter from Dr. Johnstone, senior, dated the iSth of* December 1783; informs me of the following fast. <e A prisoner some time ago dismissed from the jail here, carried the fever to his own family " in Droitwych, six miles from this place, and famous for its salt springs and works; a place where *' fevers have seldom been heard of but from contagion: the contagion from the above occasion has spread to the poor neighbours of the family above-mentioned, and fourteen individuals have already died of it."

Remarks. THIS gaol is too small for the number of prisoners. The debtors court and free-ward are spacious. In the latter is a hand-ventilator for the men-felons dungeon which is under it; but being out of repair, has not been used for many years. Were the county to allow the small sum of a guinea a year, it might always be kept in order, as is done in Worcester castle. An alarm-bell in this crowded gaol would be very proper. — Only one day-room for men and women-felons, down 3 steps, 25 feet by 12, and 6 feet 3 inches high*. The dungeon where the men-felons deep is very close and offensive, having no window, and is about 2 feet below the passage. The felons court is also too small, and the gaoler keeps his poultry in ir. There is only one fewer and that is quite exposed. It is pity that the stream just on

I might here properly refer the magistrates to what has been said in the first note under Worcester castle t and further submit to their consideration, that when felons are also confined together at night they not only instruct each other in wickedness, and rob one another; but one ingenious man may effect the escape of many; as lately happened at Derby, Maidstone, &c.

the outside of the walls is not within them. I was pleased to see plenty of clean firazv in the men's and women's dungeons; and found it was owing to the generous and exemplary practice of not farming it, but allowing the gaoler to order it whenever wanted, and the county paying for it themselves. The chapel is small, and at the top of the house. It is painful for prisoners loaded with irons to go up and down the stairs. The ad: for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. No infirmary: no bath.

Mr. Hughes is apothecary to the county infirmary, which is near the gaol. He receives £& of the salary of £20 allowed by the county; the remaining £12 is paid to the infirmary for drugs.

WOLVERHAMPTON. Only two rooms about 12 feet square, viz. a common day-room on the ground-floor; and a night-room above, for men: women sleep in the day-room. The prison dirty, and most of the draw worn to dust. The court not secure: no water: no employment. Weekly allowance supplied by the keeper, in bread, fourteen pence: cheese, seven pence: draw, three pence. Keeper's salary, JT25: licence for beer: fees, is. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up.

The prison is greatly out of repair: and so insecure, that prisoners, even for the slighted offences, are kept in irons. The county may redress this; for they have a large garden close to the prison (which they did let with an old house on the spot) now occupied by the keeper. Sometimes, here are fourteen or fifteen prisoners, and to prevent suffocation, they are let out into the court, which is 174 feet by 154.

THIS prison was built, as by date in the debtors court, 1705. — Separate courts Remark*. for debtors and felons; but the latter have no water. For this reason, and because their day-room is in the debtors court, both debtors and felons are commonly together in that court. Commodious apartments for master's-side debtors: and two large free wards for the common-side. For felons there are two night-dungeons down 11 steps: that for men was a few years ago made more airy by an additional Window: and might be freshened by a hand-ventilator which is in the room over the

chapel, but has not been used for many years. The women's dungeon might also be freshened by the same. The day-room for felons is small, 15^ feet by 5^: a separate day-room is necessary to prevent the dreadful consequences of the men and women being together. Most of the women when moved to the bridewell are with child. The county has enclosed another court, which I thought had been designed for women, but it has not yet been used. Here are three large lamps in the court supplied at the county's expence.

No infirmary: no bath: if the proposed improvements will be some protection against the gaol-fever, which of late years has prevailed here more than once, they will not secure prisoners against the small-pox and other diseases. When the apothecary finds that a sick prisoner should have better diet, he orders the gaoler to provide it, and signs his bill for the amount; which is readily allowed by the justices at quarter sessions.

Of the 24 felons in September 1776, 14 were convicts' for transportation. The county allowed transports convicted at quarter sessions as much as those convicted at assize had from the king's allowance, viz. is. 6d. a week. In 1779, there were several convicts, one of whom had been ordered to the Thames in the summer assize 1777. At my last visit here were 6 convicts.

Mr. Wood, who, before the appointing of a chaplain, read prayers three times a week, and had £5 a year, was employed in the same service, and received of the chaplains the same salary, till his death. — I believe the magift rates made the chaplain's salary^ more, in favour of Mr. Wood.

The justices of this county, at the general quarter sessions nth Jan. 1774, were so considerate and humane, as to prohibit the demanding from prisoners at their entrance into this gaol, or into the county bridewell, any money for drink, by the name of garnifoi or any other name: and to require that two or more fair copies of their said order should be hung up in the most public places of the gaol, for the inspection of debtors, as well as felons; that the unfortunate might not afterwards be imposed upon.

The clauses against spirituous liquors; the prohibition of garnish; and a new table of fees; were all hung up, and very conspicuous in the debtors hall; and these tables, with the act for preserving the health of prisoners, were hung up in the chapel.

THIS, like the county gaol, is too small: only one day-room for men and women, and a work-room. Two night-rooms above for women. In one of them I saw a poor young creature-too ill to come down stairs; she was languishing on the floor in a consumption. The night-room for men is a dungeon down ten steps. There is a small court with water. By means of a door from this into one of the

This is the only house ofcorreSlion for the county. The gaol being too small and enclosed with building?, and the windows of the bridewell opening into the courts of the gaol, if the whole were converted into a house of correction, every convenience might be made for labour and solitary confinement. A new gaol might then be built that would do credit to the county. — I am informed that Baron Hotham, at the assize the 24th of July, 1782, laid a fine of fzoooo on the county, to oblige the justices to build a county court. I am persuacted, had the Baron known the state of the gaol, he would first have laid a fine for the purpose of re-

Bride- On the castle-green, is quite out of repair. Indeed it is not only ruinous, but dan-

well. gerous: a cross wall is parted a great way from the wall against which it abutted. In

the day-room there was a large quantity of water from the roof. No fire-place: offensive sewers: no court: no water: no stated allowance: no employment. Keeper's salary, £10. He told me that a little before I came, a prisoner died after three weeks confinement. Six prisoners, whom I saw there at my first visit, complained of being almost famished. They were sent hither from the assize a few days before to hard labour (as the sentence usually runs) for six months. The justices had ordered the keeper to supply each of them daily with a two-penny loaf: but he had neglected them. They broke out soon after.

The above was the state of this prison in 1776. — In 1779 they were repairing it; for the cross wall had fallen in But the spot on which it is built is so confined, that it cannot be convenient. There are only two rooms for work and lodging for both sexes, 22 feet 9 inches by 21: no chimneys: no straw: as there is no court, 8 the

MONMOUTH.

ONLY one court: a small day-room and six bed-rooms for debtors. Felons night-room at the top of the house, 22 feet by 15, with only one window about 3 feet square. Besides the difficulty of going daily up and down in irons; when water is to be carried Jo high, and the staircase, like this, is narrow and inconvenient, a room is seldom clean and healthy. This cannot be so, if it be crowded. At my first visit in 1774, they had the gaol-fever, of which J. Daverel and several of his prisoners, and some of their friends died. — No bath: no infirmary: there is room to build one at the bottom of the court, where the county has been at the unnecessary expence of building a stable. If the brewhouse were used for a felons day-room, men and women might be separated. — After the mortality mentioned above, all the prisoners were new-clothed by the duke of Beaufort.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at USK.

This prison was formerly a chapel. On the ground-floor is a lodging-room for men (2i feet by 74.), and another for women. There are two rooms at top of the house, but I saw no prisoners there. The keeper's wife told me that many years ago the prison was crowded*, and herself, her father, who was then keeper, and many others of the family, had the gaol-fever: three of them, and several prisoners died of it. The danger of such a calamity for the future would be much lessened, if proper rooms were built in the keeper's large garden.

The rooms which are now built for the keeper are some small improvement of this prison. There is a court with a pump. The prisoners allowance, two pence a day. The spinning-wheels, &Ci are not provided by the county. The keeper has all the profit of the work. Salary, .£21: licence for beer; clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. Fees, 55. 6d. no table. This prison is now kept clean.

[Remarks.]

THE castle is also one of the county bridewells: yet only one court for all prisoners; and one day-room (11 feet 9 inches by 10 feet 7,) for men and women-felons. The free ward for debtors is 19 feet by 11, which having no window, part of the plaster wall is broke down for light and air. The night-room (the Main) for men-felons, though up many stone steps, is close and dark; and the floor is so ruinous, that it cannot be washed. Adjoining to the Main, there are other night-rooms for fines, &c. These have also their separate day-room. The whole prison was much out of repair, and had not been white-washed for many years. The upper rooms were the bridewell; but at my last visit they were used for an infirmary. Many prisoners died here in 1773, and I generally saw some sick in this gaol; eight died

* In the city of Glocester there is no assize of bread.

[Glocester Castle.]

about Christmas 1778 of the small-pox; and in 1783, several died of that disorder and the gaol-fever. Only one sewer. No bath*. Neither clauses against spirituous liquors, nor the act for preserving the health of prisoners, are hung up.

There is no separation of the women, or of the bridewell prisoners. The licentious intercourse of the sexes is shocking to decency and humanity. Many children have been born in this gaol. There is a small chapel, but all the endeavours of the chaplain to promote reformation among the prisoners must necessarily be defeated, by the inattention of the magistrates, and their neglect of framing and enforcing good regulations. vPerhaps this is the reason the chaplain seldom attends.

---

Of the felons &c. in September and December 1776, thirteen were transports: most of them convicted at Lent assize 1775. About twenty were fines; who, not having the county allowance, nor any employment, were in September very pitiable objects indeed; half naked, and almost famished. But in December their appearance was much altered. Mr. Raikes-f* and other gentlemen took pity on them, and generously contributed toward the feeding and clothing them. Mr. Raikes continues his unremitting attention to the prisoners. Eleven of the twenty-four in 1779, sixteen in 1782, and fourteen in 1783, were fines without any employment or allowance. The gaoler haSjfio a year as bridewell keeper.

In this gaol were some prisoners, who had been arrested by exchequer writs; in which an officer is commanded to bring the body before the barons of the exchequer — at Westminster — to answer our sovereign lord the king concerning divers trespasses, contempts, and offences, &c." The prisoners are called contempts. In different parts of the kingdom, there are many prisoners detained by such writs.

---

At my visit in Dec. 1782, I found some improvements made in the castle: the floors laid with stone; boxes or bedsteads for the felons and fines; and the whole prison white-washed. — When prisons are repaired, particular care should be taken for the admission of air. The windows should not be close glazed. — I observed numbers of the townsmen drinking in the tap-room here, as in too many other gaols.

I was happy to hear in October 1783, that this county has determined to build a new gaol, and to reform the bridewells; which is principally owing to the spirited exertions of the chairman of the grand jury Sir George Onesiphorus Paul.

* A bath, like that in the county hospital, with an easy descent, would induce felons even with their irons to go in This would freshen and revive them, and might be the means of preventing the gaol-fever.

† This gentleman is also the founder of a benevolent and useful institution for the children of the poor in this city. Having observed great numbers of them in this manufacturing place to spend their Sundays in an idle and dissolute manner, he established several little schools for their instruction on the evenings of that day; which, by his attention and liberal encouragement, have had a happy effect in improving the morals of the younger classes; many of whom now look up to their kind benefactor with great esteem and affection. Perhaps Mr. Raikes's frequent visits to the castle suggested to him this plan, as the best means of preventing youth from coming there.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

LAWFORD's GATE, Bristol, built 1716, has two rooms below and two above*, 18 feet by 16: in those above are beds for those who pay. There is a dark room, the dungeon (11 feet 10 inches by 7 feet 2), in which felons lleep. No chimneys. Court 22 feet by 18; with a pump. It is not secure; and prisoners are always confined in their rooms. It may be enlarged from the keeper's garden; and should be made secure, that prisoners may use it, and have access to the pump. The keeper readily agreed with me in that opinion. Salary, ^10: fees, 6s. Sd. no table. Straw, ten shillings a quarter: allowance, if a prisoner be very poor, 2d. a day: no employment. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. By a register kept in the prison, it appears that in eight years and a half to September 1776, there were committed to it 572 prisoners.

Many such, he said, he had known quite incapable of working for some weeks after their discharge. He told me, that some years ago his prisoners used to grind malt for a penny a bushel; and the justices would not licence any victualler whose malt was not ground here: but that of late years they have done no work at all.

The city pays debtors in common, three shillings a week: they have not received, for nineteen years past, the sixteen shillings formerly paid by the corporation. On the 13th of December, prisoners have ten shillings worth of bread from an estate in Hemstead near this city. It is- sent in two-penny loaves. No memorial of it in the gaol. There are some rules, dated 1694, in which the sums for garnish are specified; but as they are not signed, I did not copy them. The gaoler also kept the city bridewell at the East-gate: but that being taken down, offenders are committed to this gaol.

The above was the (late of this prison in 1779; but at my-visit in April 1782, it was taken down, an act of parliament having passed in 1781, for building anew gaol, " in some convenient and healthy filiation: as it will tend greatly to the safety and health of persons confined therein."

In September 1783 the new gaol v/aa nearly finished, but not occupied. This is built on too small a scale, the walls and rooms are low, there cannot be a proper reparation of the sexes, or of debtors and felons; and the sewers will be offensive.

was paid a penny. If a little court, which is now {hut up from the gaol, and totally useless, were cleared, and opened towards the prison, it would be very conducive to health and convenience. The chapel is very low and inconvenient.

St. Cross's hospital bread (the dole) is about a penny loaf given to each of the prisoners fix limes a year; viz. on the eve of the following days, loth August, 31st October, Christmas, Easter, 3d of May, and Whitsunday.

The College allowance to felons is, once a week, an ox's head, four sheep's heads and hengcs, about seventeen pints of oatmeal, three pints of salt, twelve loaves the size of twopenny halfpenny ones, about twenty-four gallons of table beer, and generally three times a week the broken vitftuals.

The gaoler has two guineas a year for keeping a bread account, to check the baker. The justices also take care of this matter; and, in consequence, the quarterly bills, now the prisoners have three halfpence a day, amount to no more than they did in the lad gaoler's and baker's time, when the allowance was but a penny a day, and there was about the same number of prisoners.

The act for preserving the health of prisoners was painted on a board, and hung in the court, by order of the justices; bur, there is no bath.

WINCHESTER. The four rooms are too close, and the court (which Is not paved, 37 feet 5 inches, by 13 feet 10) is too small for the prisoners, who are commonly numerous; especially at quarter sessions, when they are brought hither from the other bridewells. There is only one day-room (26 feet by 20 feet inches) for men and women. The lodging-room below for the former, is 17 feet 3 inches by 10 feet 3.

Mr. White, and several other gaolers, have expressed to me their sincere wish, that some precise ord rs were given for their own conduit, and for that of the debtors, as well as the felons; since for want of such orders, the debtors in their irregularities often set at defiance the keepers, who are embarrassed for want of knowing how they are to proceed in- treating them.

The bridewell for twenty-eight parishes; and the town-gaol, are now both in the old work-house; four rooms being appropriated to that purpose. No chimney: no straw: no court: no water accessible to prisoners. There are two keepers; one for the county bridewell, whose salary is £19: 15: 0; the other for the gaol, whose salary is £3. Neither the act for preserving the health of prisoners, nor clauses against spirituous liquors hung up.

The Poor are removed from the old work-house to an House of Industry built in the forest of Parkhurf, near Newport, for the twenty-nine parishes, or whole island. Eighty acres of land, statute measure, was a. grant from the crown, to the guardians of the poor, March 21, 1772, for 999 years, at the yearly rent of £8: 17: 9 *. At my last visit there were 65 men, L50 women, 151; boys and 146 girls. The house was neat and clean; and those lodging-rooms were fresh which had apertures

in the ceilings (18 inches by 12). The women's sick ward (28 feet wide) was quite clean, and the beds were not crowded*.

The principal work of the house was making sacks, biscuit and nail bags, besides, there were tailors and shoe-makers employed. The provisions were good; the girlsr and boys were clean, a set of fine healthy children.

The oeconomy of giving them (especially the elderly people) no more of their earnings than one penny in the shilling, is not for the advantage of the house. — Here is a fault (which is common in such buildings), that the dining-hall, workrooms, and bed-rooms, are all too low. — In the passages and staircases of such houses, all expedients should be used to promote the circulation of air.

At WINCHESTER is

A Prison for Debtors, the Cheney Court in and for the liberty of the Soke: die property of the Bishop. Two rooms, one 17 feet square, the other near 9, and-64- high. Out of repair. There is a garden into which prisoners who give security are admitted. The bounty of the duke of Chandos did supply this prison every week, (when there were prisoners) with one gallon loaf, and about twenty pounds of beef. Fees, 17s. lod. no table. Licence for beer. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. Several people drinking, as in a disorderly alehouse.

I observed an excellent contrivance in the windows of the women's sick-ward. By a small hafp in the upper sass and staples in the frames, when that sass is in part, or entirely down; a padlock prevents the nurses or patients putting it immediately up, as they generally do in the county hospitals, and at Plymouth, and Hajlar, when the medical gentlemen leave the rooms. Dr. Lind told me that in summer time he nails down some of the falhes in the passages, &c.

of I went over the Poor-house in this town, where there are some good rules and orders; I copy the' last (the twenty-fourth). " That these orders be publicly read once a week, that no one may pretend-to plead ignorance thereof." — I shall take this opportunity to make an observation respecting the conduit of these houses, which I think of importance. It is well known that the grozm-up inhabitants of these places are generally the slothful and idle, and will do no more work than they are absolutely compelled to perform, and are full of contrivances to excuse themselves from labour. Their precepts and example cannot fail of having a very mischievous effect upon the children who associate with them. On this account, besides a separation-of the different sexes, I would recommend a total separation of all children above seven years of age, from the adults. The want of this, I am persuacted, is the reason why so few good and industrious servants come out of poor houses.

Salisbury County Gaol.

In 1776, there was a new building in the court; a liable, cart-house, and brew-house; with an infirmary over them, one room for men, another for women. I could not help wishing that the lower part instead of liable &c. had been two day-rooms with fire-places, one for debtors, another for felons. That part of the prison which was the bridewell is not secure; and petty offenders are confined in the gaol.

Just without the prison-gate was a round staple fixed in the wall: through it was put a chain, at each end of which a common-side debtor padlocked by the leg. Hood offering to those who pass by, nets, laces, purses, &c. made in the prison. The two whom I saw there last were crown debtors not cleared by the insolvent ad. Now, this is not permitted.

At Christmas, felons chained together are permitted to go about; one of them carrying a sack or balket for food; another, a box for money.

Twenty pounds a year of the chaplain's salary is paid by Lord Weymouth by a bequest of ‘Thomas Thyme, Esq. who bound for payment the manors of Weobly and Ross in the county of Hereford. The bequest was recognized by Lord Weymouth in a deed of settlement dated 2d of November 1709.

Lord Pembroke pays a legacy of £5 a year out of the manor of Swallow Cliff in this county; part to the chaplain himself, viz. a guinea for a hat; the remainder to be by him distributed among the prisoners. Mr. Smith of Salisbury left the interest of jT$o to be divided among them. No memorial of any legacy hung up in the gaol. The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up.

DEVIZES. This is also the town gaol. It has two night-ro&ns for men, and two for women: but the day-room (19^ feet by 18) and court-yard, common. Afmall workshop; I saw nobody in it. An infirmary of two rooms. Four rooms for master's-side debtors. Clean and white-wa(hed at my late visits.

Allowance to offenders, three-halfpennyworth of bread a day (weight in Sep. 1776, 18 oz. in March 1782, 14 oz.) and a pint of small beer. Straw, 2 guineas a year. — In 1779, the bread allowance was one pound and a half. A window is now made in the keeper's kitchen which overlooks the court. The prisoners are without employment: the shutters of the work-room nailed up. No fees are demanded of the prisoners: the county pays the gaoler 7s. 8d. for each.

There was a debtor in 1776 from the court of requestsj he had a wife and four small children. In 1782, a weaver who had five children, was confined for a debt of ior. 2d. Besides the coils, &c. he was charged ioj. 6d. for bringing to prison, though only from Caine at 7 miles distance. There was also a woman for a debt of 21. 3d. coils and fees 5s. id. and ioj. 6d. for conveyance. Twelve weeks confinement clears such debtors*.

A few years ago the gaol-fever carried off many: but as the infirmary and forne of the other rooms mentioned above have been built since that time, there is now little danger of that distemper; provided care be taken to separate prisoners in the apartments built for that purpose, some of which I found occupied by the keeper, and the men all crowded into one night-room. The keeper has a salary of £10, and keeps a public house. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up.

The justices have very judiciously provided for the relief of prisoners going to different quarter sessions. Their order, dated 12th April 1774, is as follows.

Sherborn, Dorset. The great inhumanity that frequently happens unto the several prisonersr-conveyed ta the different quarter sessions to be tryed — by the walking loaded with heavy irons — being taken into consideration — it is the resolution and order of this court that for the future the gaol-keeper and bridewell-keeper shall provide for one prisoner only a horse, for two or more a convenient cart or carriage for the conveying the m: and to be allowed the sum of three pence per mile for one person; for two or more the Turn of six pence a mile &c.

THIS gaol is the property of John Denny Rolley Esq. whose family had a grant of it from the duchy of Cornwall: the late gaoler paid him rent £22 per annum. The house and court are too small: there is only one day-room for men and women felons; this is used as the chapel. Over it is the women's lodging-room. There are three rooms for fines, &c. one below and two above} that below is sometimes used for the condemned. There are three night-dungeons (about 20 feet by 12) down three steps; the small window of one of them is under a staircase. These dungeons are the more unhealthy as at one part they are 7 or 8 feet under ground. Mr. Rule the 7 late

In it is an offensive sewer. — At the top of the gaoler's house is an alarm-bell. — The prisoners formerly made cabbage-nets for two pence a dozen; and purses of different forts from four pence to seven pence a dozen: the turnkey found the twine and thread Two sailors fined a shilling each had £1: 1: 4 each to pay the clerk of the peace, besides the gaoler's fees.

It was commendable and exemplary in the justices of this county to fix the felons allowance by a certain weight of good bread, not variable with the price.

There is no table of fees. But by the close of the preamble at the Sheriff's Ward, the table there seems to have included originally the fees of this gaol also. The gaoler had for each transport two guineas from the merchant, to whom the county paid per.contract £5. The a# for preserving the health of prisoners is not hung up.

About Christmas, the gaoler permits his prisoners to solicit charity in the city. When I was there in December 1775, the box was broke open, as was supposed, by the person who conducted them, as he absconded. If any gentleman would undertake the disposal of the contributions, this would not only prevent such a fraud, but the money laid out for meat, firing, &c. would be far more beneficial than their spending most of it in liquor.

At my visit in 1779, 1782 and 1783, I found the men together encouraging and confirming one another in wickedness, and the women are obliged to associate with them in the day-time f.

An elegant shire-hall is now finished: may it not be hoped that the gentlemen will turn their thoughts to this crowded, offensive and destructive gaol, especially the proprietor, who (in 1782) liberally subscribed £1000 to encourage seamen to enter into-his majesty's fleet; and who possesses an estate to uphold this prison?.

This art is very soon learnt, and when the prisoners were thus employed, I found them cheerful and healthy; they said they earned from three halfpence to two pence a day each, with which they got a little milk, or beer to their bread; and the old keeper said " it kept them out of mischief."

f From good information, I might justly refer the magistrates to what I have said undei Glocester castle (page 363), and the note at Stafford (page 350).

THE Sheriff's ward or prison is in the parish of St. Thomas the apostle, in the county of Devon. It has several large and convenient rooms for master's-side debtors, and also six rooms and a work-room on the common-side. Court spacious. Good rules of oeconomy. A humane keeper. He has a good fire for common-side debtors — he said he would gladly relinquish his fees for a salary of £100 — and told me that during his time, about fifteen years, no more than five or six debtors had obtained their aliment, the groats. In 1779, one debtor, on attachment from the court of chancery, had continued here from May 1758, who would not take the benefit of the insolvent acts; but at my last visit he was dead. Here is still an older prisoner, Grace Hooper, whose warrant of commitment is dated 30th of November 1741.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at EXETER, in st. Thomas's.

At my first visits this prison was out of repair: the windows small and glazed; yet no casements. An infirmary. — Keeper's salary, £60: no fees. He was a woollen manufacturer, and did employ some of his prisoners. Others of them might have been employed in the large garden and court at rope making, packthread spinning, &c.

Allowance, two-pennyworth of bread a day (weight in Sep. 1774, 19T ounces', in July 1782, 18 ounces). The county appointed a chaplain, with a salary of £30, and a house joining to the prison which he let for £6 a year, but lately this house was taken into the prison, and the salary is .£36: duty no fixed time.

Soon after my visit in 1775 the surgeon and some of the prisoners died of the gaol-fever: afterwards the prison was repaired and improved. On the men's side there is a hall or chapel and two large lodging-rooms: on the women's side two rooms and a lodging-room; and the courts are fieparate. The prison now white-washed twice a year. The rooms and court for the sick are sometimes used for vagrants. No bath: no employment.

There is no memorial in the prisons at Exeter of the following donations, mentioned in Richard Izacke's Alphabetical Register, &c.. printed in 1736. Such valuable Registers of persons last wills, grants, &c. in other cities, would prevent the misapplication of many charities.

Reynold Hayne in 1354, bequeathed all his lands and tenements lying in the suburbs of the said city to the cathedral church of St. Peter there, for the relief of those that are imprisoned in the common gaol in the said city.

William Paramore by will 2?.d Feb. 1570, bequeathed to the needy prisoners in the king's gaol in Exeter, in the South-gate gaol there, and in the Counter, to every of them ten shillings for ever, yearly, to be paid by his heirs out of his lands in the Cookrow in Exeter.

"Thomas Bridgman by will 3d of April 1641, gave to the said city the sum of £60 to be continued as a perpetual flock, whereof the interest of £40 to be bestowed upon the prisoners in the upper prison; and the interest of the other £20 to be bestowed upon the prisoners in the lower prison, and this likewise to continue for ever.

Three rooms for felons &c. and two rooms over them for debtors. One of the former, the clink, 15 feet by 8 feet 3 inches, and about feet high, with a wicket in the door 7 inches by 5 to admit light and air. To this, as I was informed, three men who were confined near two months under sentence of Transportation, came by turns for breath. The door had not been opened for five weeks when I with difficulty entered to see a pale inhabitant. He had been there ten weeks under sentence of Transportation, and said he had much rather have been hanged than confined in that noisome cell. In another room (13 feet by 5F and 6 feet 9 inches high, the window only 18 inches by 14, and the wall 2 feet 8 inches thick), at my last visit there were two prisoners; one of whom allured me he had been there upwards of seven weeks, and sometimes, with four or five other prisoners, where they were almost suffocated. — The other room is for women (17 feet by 10). The whole is dirty, and has not been white-washed for many years. No court: no water. The gaolers live distant; they are the three sergeants at mace. Fees, 15*. 4d. no table.

In the Royal Hospital at this place, the patients lie in a kind of cractes, which might be advantageously adopted in prisons, particularly in the sick rooms. These I have already described in page 39. As the construction of the hospital itself is in several respects singular, and apparently well contrived, I give a view of it (omitting two buildings, which I think improperly placed)*, and subjoin a particular description of the whole, with which, together with the annexed plan, I was favoured by my friend Dr. Farr, the worthy and ingenious physician of the hospital.

The Royal Hospital for the reception of fck and hurt fearnn and marines Is situated at Stemhouse, nearly equidistant from the two towns of Plymouth and Plymouth Dock; a small arm of the fca which pafles by Stcsehouse, under the Hospital wall, admitting of boats to land, at the outer gate, by the time of half-flood tide.

It consists of eleven large buildings, and four lesser, the whole forming a square, but detached from each other, for the purpose of admitting a freer circulation of air, as also of classing the several disorders, in such manner, as may bell prevent the spread of contagion.

The buildings are of rough marble, raised in the neighbourhood, with purbeck rullicated coyns, and in front is a handsome colonnade, supported by moor stone piliars, with a flat roof covered with lead, which serves as an airing ground for convalescents in bad weather.

The buildings are numbered, viz. ten buildings (exclusive of the center, or chapel building) each containing six wards, in all sixty; each ward will conveniently hold twenty cractes, and in the recovery wards, if required, twenty-five; so that with four under-ground wards, in the 7th, gth, and

Plymouth Royal Hospital.

[Plymouth Royal Hospital.]

9th buildings, exclusive of the small-pox ward, fifteen hundred patients may on an emergency be accommodated. — Each ward in the ground, and first floor is 60 feet by 23 feet 8 inches and 12 feet 2 inches high; in the attic story, length and breadth the same, height 9 feet 6 inches.

The ground-floor of the center or chapel building, contains the dispensary, labor tory, surgery, and dispensers apartments; the first floor, the chapel, council room, with apartments in that and the attic story, for the matrons, assistant surgeons, assistant dispensers &c.

The area in the middle of the hospital is handsomely laid out with grass plats intersected by gravel walks, which are kept in very good order; besides which there is a large airing ground, surrounding the whole, containing in all about twelve acres.

At the higher end of the airing ground to the north, is a large reservoir of water, which by means of a chain pump, throws the water into a leaden cistern, which being higher, conveys the water by means of leaden pipes, into every ward, for the use of the patients, cleansing the water closets, filling the baths &c. every building being furnished with a bath and copper for heating the water to the temperature required.

Besides this reservoir, a new one has lately been constructed upwards of 43 feet long by 25 wide, and 5 feet 6 inches deep, capable of containing 180 tons of water, intended for the purpose of scouring all the main drains, as also the leading drains from the five higher buildings — the others are regularly cleansed by scavengers employed for that purpose, the drains being so constructed as to admit of a man walking through them; by this means they are now kept tolerably sweet, the only smell which remains, especially when the wind is in certain directions, probably arises from the cisterns (or sink-traps as they are called) which are funk for the purpose of receiving the foil from the pipes and kept covered with water, to prevent any offensive smell; but as they must be emptied by hand, provided a fall could be got sufficient to carry off the soil at once from the leading to the main drain, it should seem to be more eligible than this contrivance*.

Patients on admission are washed and supplied with hospital dresses, and their own clothes carried to the fumigating house. A nurse is allowed for every ten men; the greatest attention is paid to cleanliness, and the keeping the wards always well ventilated.

Some few erections are still wanted to render this Hospital complete, e. g. the building a chapel distinct on some part of the airing ground, and converting the present one into a dining hall for patients on full diet; two pavilions at the entrance, one for a receiving room for patients, on admission before they are warded, the other for a council room, surveying invalids &c. for want of which many inconveniences in time of war have been experienced.

The Regulations respecting the nurses, and other servants of the royal hospital; and the Orders to be observed by the patients are hung up in the hospital.

A Scheme of Diet to be used at Plymouth Hospital.

1st. Low Diet. Water gruel, panado, rice gruel, milk pottage, or broth, and bread and butter, if necessary. For drink, toast and water, ptisan, or white decoction.

2d. Half Diet. For breakfast, milk pottage; for dinner, half a pound of mutton, some light bread pudding, or in lieu of it, some greens; a pint of broth, one pound of bread, one quart of small beer; the men upon this diet to dine in their own wards.

3d. Full Diet. Breakfast as above; for dinner one pound of meat, one pint of broth, one pound of bread, three pints of small beer; supper in the two last named diets, to be of the broth left at dinner; or, if thought necessary, to be of milk pottage.

Rice milk, orange whey, orange and lemon water, tamarind whey and water, vinegar whey, balm tea, sage tea. These to be discretionally ordered by the Physician and Surgeons.

[Remarks.]

THIS gaol, though built in the large green belonging to the old ruinous castle, is very small; house and court measuring only 52 feet by 44; and the house not covering half that ground. The prison is a room or passage 23½ feet by 7½, with only one window 2 feet by 1½: and three dungeons or cages on the side opposite the window: these are about 6½ feet deep; one 9 feet long; one about 8; one not 5: this last for women. They were all very offensive. No chimney: no water: no sewers: damp earth floors: no infirmary. The court not secure; and prisoners seldom permitted to go out to it. Indeed the whole prison is out of repair, and yet the goaler lives distant. I once found the prisoners chained two or three together. Their provision was put down to them through a hole (9 inches by 8) in the floor of the room above (used as a chapel); and those who served them there, often caught the fatal fever. At my first visit I found the keeper, his assistant, and all the prisoners but one (an old soldier) sick of it: and heard that a few years before, many prisoners had died of it; and the keeper and his wife in one night.

392 CORNWALL.Western Circuit.

[Launceston.]

I learned that a woman who was discharged just before my first visit (by the grand jury making a collection for her fees) had been confined three years by the ecclesiastical court, and had three children in the gaol. There is no table of fees.

The King, of his royal bounty, offered £2500 towards a new gaol; but nothing had been done by the county in 1776.

In 1779, five hundred pounds of the king's bounty was appropriated to this gaol. In a passage 5½ feet wide there were for men four new cells (8 feet by 6½, and 8 feet 4 inches high) a day-room, and a court. Over these rooms are the gaoler's apartments. Adjoining is the old gaol, which is for women and the court is made secure: no water.

I was edified by the serious behaviour of the chaplain at prayers. The prisoners respect him, and were very attentive.

The mayor sends the prisoners weekly one shillings worth of bread: no memorial of the legacy in the gaol. Transports had not the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week. Neither clauses against spirituous liquors, nor the act for preserving the health of prisoners, are hung up.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at BODMIN.

[Bridewell.]

The county pays £20 a year for this prison. It is much out of repair; and the walls round the court not safe enough to let prisoners use it. The night-rooms are two garrets, with small sky-lights 17 inches by 12, close glazed. I was informed that a few years ago the gaol-fever Was very fatal, not only in the prison, but also in the town. Keeper's salary raised from £20 to £28: fees, 16s. 8d. no table. Allowance, a three-penny loaf in two days (weight, Dec. 1775, 31oz.). A surgeon to this bridewell: his salary £20.

THIS prison, for which the sheriff paid £20 a year, was out of repair. A spacious back court, with a stream running through it. The keeper paid window-tax, £3: 7: 0; and some windows were stopped up*. He said he had been in that office above twenty years; and during the whole time had but four prisoners who obtained from their creditors the allowance commonly called the groats.

This was the account in 1779, but now the prison is discontinued, and the debtors are sent to the new gaol.

* I have mentioned this circumstance in the beginning of my work, page 8. and have besides often occasionally noticed it, since in several counties, no demand is made of this tax in prisons; and where it is, the gentlemen in the commission of the peace probably do not know or attend to it. Keepers always pay it with great reluctance; and it is a temptation to them to stop up windows the air from which may be very essential to the health of the prisoners.

THIS new gaol is built on a fine eminence, at a little distance from the town, where there is a constant current of water. Here is a good house for the gaoler, in which there are apartments for master's-side debtors, and a chapel. There are separate rooms and courts for each sex of debtors, of felons, and of petty offenders or bridewell prisoners; and each prisoner has a separate lodging-room (about 8 feet 2 inches by 5 feet 8, and 7½ feet high), which is furnished with a bedstead, straw-bed, two blankets and a coverlet. There are two rooms for an infirmary, and under them three condemned cells. In two of the courts are baths. — In the centre of the gaoler's house there is a turret with an alarm-bell and clock. — The men who are confined for petty offences, are employed in sawing and polishing stone, and, as they have the county allowance, have only one sixth of what they earn. Clauses against spirituous liquors are hung up. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is not hung up, but the gaol is now kept very neat and clean.

The sheriff and his deputy, it is to be hoped, will often visit, and enquire into the state and treatment of the felons, as well as the debtors.

FALMOUTH TOWN GAOL.

TRURO Town Gaol. Built about ten years ago. Two houses in front, for the two sergeants at mace who are the keepers. In the back court is the prison; which consists of four convenient rooms; the two upper ones are vaulted, and have chimneys: no water.

1775, Dec. 18, No prisoners. *783, Feb. 4, One prisoner.

PENZANCE Town Gaol. Two close rooms: no court: no water,

1775, Dec. 21, No prisoners.

At PENZANCE is also A Prison for the Hundred and Liberties of Penwith *1.

The property of Lord Arundel. Two rooms in the keeper's liable-yard; but distant from his house, and quite out of fight and hearing. The room for men is full 11 feet square, and 6 high: window 18 inches square: no chimney. Earth floor, very damp. The door had not been opened for four weeks when I went in; and then the keeper began to clear away the dirt. There was only one debtor, wha seemed to have been robust, but was grown pale by ten weeks close confinement, with little food, which he had from, a brother, who was poor and had a family. He said, the dampness of the prison, with but little straw, had obliged him (he spoke with sorrow) to send for the bed on which some of his children lay. He had a wife and ten children, two of whom died since he came thither, and the rest were almost starving. — He has written me a letter since, by which I learn that his distress was not.

A few years ago five prisoners, I was informed, grew desperate by what they suffered in this wretched prison, and broke out.

1775, Dec. 21, Prisoner 1.

LOSTWITHIEL Gaol, for Debtors, Is the property of the Duke of Cornwall, lord of the Stannaries. A vaulted room below; a large room on the first floor and three rooms over it. These are white-washed once a year. (There are several other rooms designed for confinement, and they were used one year as the sheriff's ward for the county.) The rules extend over the whole borough. The keeper told me that he had a prisoner who was arrested for £6: the man had a large family, and not a bad character; yet the plaintiff paid him his groats for two years; and dying the n, bound his estate for the continual payment of them: but the insolvent act freed the prisoner and the estate. Keeper no salary: fees, 13J. 4^. no table.

THE gaol is near the river, and has no offensive sewers. Debtors have the front court, a day-room and fifteen lodging-rooms, five of which are free wards. The felons have a day-room; and a lodging-room (42 feet by 18), called the long-gaol> in which two small windows towards the river are improperly flopped up: straw on the stone floors; no bedsteads. The women felons have a lodging-room and a close court, in which is no water. These have no separate day-room:a room, which is fit, and seems to have been designed for that use, is taken by the gaoler for a {table. No infirmary: no bath. This gaol is too small for the general number of prisoners. Assizes never held here. Prisoners are removed for trial to the bridewell at Taunton; or to Bridgewater, where the prison is only one room; or to Wells, where there is no prison at all: and yet, at Midsummer assize 1775, the prisoners were kept in that city eight days. Clauses against spirituous liquors, and the act for preserving the health of prisoners, not hung up.

From a legacy of Mr. Kelfon of Nor ton, the poorest debtors have fifty shillings at Midsummer. No memorial hung up.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

TAUNTON. This prison, called Wilton gaol (from the name of the parish in which it (lands), has on the ground-floor, a work-room, a lodging-room for men, the condemned cell, and the chapel. On the first floor the women's lodging-room, a draw-room, and several rooms with beds for prisoners who pay for them. — Men and women are together in the day-room. No employment. Some years ago, eight prisoners, out of nineteen, died of the gaol-fever. Allowance, two pence a day. Keeper's salary, ,£25: fees, 14s. 4d. no table. Licence for beer. At my visit in 1779, all the prisoners, and at my lad visit two women and a man, were in irons. Two inconvenient bathing tubs; never used.

The county had generously gone to the limit of the act; and appointed to the chaplain of this bridewell, and of that at Shepton-Mallet (as well as to the chaplain of the county gaol) a salary of £50, but the chaplains in the county gaol and at Shepton-Mallet having neglected their duty, I was informed in 1782, that the justices had reduced the salary here to^20, and taken off the whole at Shepton-

BRISTOL NEWGATE.

THIS Newgate (as that in the metropolis) stands in the midst of the city. It is too small for the general number of prisoners. For debtors there are about fifteen rooms; yet no free ward. The poorest pay ten pence halfpenny a week: others, two shillings and six-pence. For women-felons, a day-room and several night-rooms. For men-felons, a day-room, which might be conveniently enlarged: a court adjacent 20 feet by 12, very close. Their dungeon, the Pit, down 18 steps, is 17 feet diameter, and 8-j high: barrack-bedsteads: no bedding nor straw. It is close and offensive $ only a small window. There is another yard, the Pennis-Court, larger than that of the felons: here (as in several other gaols) I have seen the debtors mix in diversions with the felons; by which, they become more daring and wicked than the felons. In this court is a convenient bath, but seldom used. Pumps out of order. Here is no proper separation of men and women, nor of fines, &c. A room or two at the top of the house for an infirmary. There are many narrow passages: the utmost attention is requisite to keep the prison healthy. I found it clean; considering it was so crowded and so close. It was scraped and white-washed once a year before the act for preserving the health of prisoners. That act is neatly painted on a board hung up in the chapel, which is commodious and has a gallery: several texts of Scripture are painted in sundry parts of it. — Clauses against spirituous liquors are not hung up. No table of gaoler's fees.

The Rev. Mr. James Rouquet has been unwearied in attention to the spiritual and temporal interests of the prisoners; officiating near twenty years without a salary. He had only once a gratuity of £20 *. Mr. Easterbrook now appointed. Besides the service noted in its place, there are thirteen sermons a year, for which the preacher has £4. from a legacy.

John Hey don left £100 to be lent to two merchants, each paying annually to the corporation for the prisoners as interest of his moiety, £\:13:a. Mrs. Aldsworth left about £$ a year, to be paid by the parish of All Saints; two thirds of it to debtors, who receive the money usually on Christmas eve; the other third part is generally laid out in coverlets or blankets for felons. No memorial in the gaol of any legacy.

This was written before November 1776, when Mr. Rouquet died in the forty-seventh year of his age. The general sorrow, and the sermons preached and printed on that occasion, more than justify what I have said concerning the zeal of this pious divine.

404 SOMERSETSHIRE. Western Circuit.

[Bristol.]

BRISTOL City Bridewell. Part of it is in the keeper's house, on one side of a common footway: and part on the other side. In the keeper's house, the master's-side, are three rooms: one a day-room; in the other two are beds at six-pence a night. The common-side, the bridewell, over the way, consists of two parts separated by a court of about 50 feet by 17. Each part has two rooms on the ground-floor, and two chambers. Total eight rooms (22 feet by 17I); windows to the court; no chimneys. The court being quite out of fight of the keeper's house, he does not suffer prisoners to use it; nor the pump in it. They have no water but what is handed to them; and all the rooms are very dirty, and made offensive by sewers. Little or no straw: no employment. Keeper's salary raised from ^20 to ^30. He receives the money for bread allowance, two pence a day: but the prisoners often allured me, that what he gave them from his own loaf was far short of two-pennyworth. In Dec. 1775, I released an acquitted woman prisoner detained for fees 3s. 6d.

Above are three stories; five rooms on each: one or two of them used by the keeper: the rest for debtors; one bed in a room, in which if two prisoners sleep, they pay two shillings a week each; if one has it to himself, he pays four shillings a week. Two rooms on the second story are free wards, one for men, the other for women; on the upper floor is their work-shop. There is a small court with offensive sewers. Keeper, a sheriff's officer: no salary: fees, if from the court of requests, 3s. 6d. Debtors for large sums, 7s. 8d. no table. Licence for beer.

York,

IN the spacious area is a noble prison for debtors, which does honour to the county. Remarks. There is an ascent by a fine flight of stone steps to a floor on which are eleven rooms, full 16 feet square, near 12 feet high. Above them is the same number of rooms: one or two of these for common-side debtors. The rooms are airy and healthy. The debtors weave garters, purses, laces, &c. in the passages, as there is no work-room.

On the ground-floor are the gaoler's apartments, &c.

The felons court is down 5 steps: it is too small, and has no water: the pump is just on the outside of the palisades. The day-room for men is only 24 fe.et by 8: in it are three cells: in another place nine cells: and three in another. The cells are in general about 7^ feet by 6£, and 8| high; close and dark; having only either

[York Castle.]

a hole over the door about inches by 8, or some perforations in the door of about an inch diameter: not any of them to the open air, but into passages or entries. In most of these cells three prisoners are locked up at night; in winter from fourteen to sixteen hours: straw on the stone floors; no bedsteads. There are four condemned rooms about 7 feet square. A sewer in one of the passages often makes these parts of the gaol very offensive: and I cannot say they are clean. Indeed a clean prison is scarcely ever seen, where the water is to be brought in by the gaoler's servants. The next house to the castle-gate, and others in the neighbourhood, have river-water laid in at a moderate expence, and at my last visit it was brought into the castle-yard, but not into the felons court. No bath.

Women-felons are kept quite separate: they have two courts, but no water: you go down four steps to their two close rooms, a day and a night-room. Their condemned room is in another part of the gaol: near it is a room to confine debtors who do not behave well.

The infirmary near the gate is only one middle-sized room..When prisoners of one sex are there, those of the other are excluded: at one of my visits a sick man was kept out for that reason.

At assize some prisoners appear in court on their trial in the county-clothing *. The county pays Mr. John Sherwood £21 a year to insped and weigh the bread, and deliver it to the prisoners. He constantly attends for this purpose on Tuesday and Friday. The gaoler is a sheriff's officer. Transports convicted at quarter sessions had, besides the bread allowance, one shilling a week. Those cast at assize had the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week.

The grand {hire-hall in the castle-yard is now finished. May it not be hoped the gentlemen of this great county will not stop there, but proceed to build a proper prison for felons, in which boys may be separated from old offenders, and the other inconveniences of the present gaol avoided ? — At my last visit, an additional building, opposite to the {hire-hall, consisting of several rooms, was nearly finished f.

Yorkshire. Orders and Fees settled by the Justices of the Peace of the several Ridings of the County of York and confirmed by the Justices of Assize — which are to be observed and kept by the gaoler — and all prisoners — until the same shall be legally altered.

WEST-RIDING, WAKEFIELD. This prison is unfortunately built upon low ground; so that it is damp, and exposed to floods. Four of the wards are spacious; but all the wards and the men's three lodging-rooms are made very offensive by sewers, which are dark. Prison and court out of fight from the keeper's house, though adjoining; and some prisoners have escaped. They are now let out to the court only half an hour in the day. A prison on ground so low as this, requires the utmost attention to cleanliness. — Keeper's salary lately raised from^8o *>£105; he contracting to supply straw and coals.

ROTHWELL Prison, for Debtors, Belongs to the liberty of the honour of Pontefract in the duchy court of Lancaster. Is out of repair.

A new prison is lately built at

BATLEY. Behind a house for the keeper is the prison. Plan rectangular: the front is the wall and gate. On three sides are rooms for men-debtors; five or six about 10 feet square; four much larger for two beds in each. Two day-rooms; two work-rooms; and a dark room for the unruly: but at my last visit the day and workrooms were used for lodging-rooms. There are in a separate court two rooms for women-debtors: a provision very kind and prudent, and, I believe, peculiar to this prison. All the prison rooms are on the ground-floor. The keeper is a bailiff: has no salary. Licence for beer and wine. Fees, fee table. He pays the chief bailiff fix per annum: and rent £60.*

In the old prison at Rotlrwell, I saw both times I was there, one William Carr, a weaver: he had given a bad name to a woman who was said not to deserve a very good one:(he cited him to the ecclesiastical court; and he was imprisoned 4th of May 1774- He had a wife and three children. I will transcribe a line or two of the warrant. — " For as much as the royal power ought not to be wanting to the holy church in its complaints — attach the said W.jC. — until he shall have made satisfaction to

* the holy church as well for the contempt as for the injury by him done unto it." — He was. discharged j>6th July 1776 by the insolvent act; a clause being then inserted for those prisoners.

I with my reader be not tired with so many tables of fees, even for the counties. Yet I think I must not omit the fees which I saw in this private Prison at Rothwell: because some of them are high; and at Halifax they are the same. The table was regularly signed, nth January 1732.

At my first visit at Batley, I found a new table of fees dated 26th July 1776, the sums entirely the same.

THE high gaol is the property of the Bishop. By patent from his lordship Sir Hedworth Williamson, Bart, is perpetual sheriff. The court for master's-side debtors is only 24 feet by 10: they are permitted sometimes to walk on the leads. They have beds in the upper hall and in several other rooms. Their rooms should be ceiled, that they might be lime-whited, to prevent infectious dif-orders, and that great nuisance of bugs, of which the debtors complain much here and at other places. — Common-side debtors have no court; their free wards, the Low Gaol, are two damp unhealthy rooms 10 feet inches square, by the gateway: they are never suffered to go out of these, unless to chapel, which is the master's-side debtors hall; and not always to that: for on a Sunday when I was there, and miffed them at chapel, they told me they were not permitted to go thither. No sewers: at more than one of my visits, I learned that the dirt, allies, &c. had lain there many month?. There is a double barrelled pump, which raises water about 70 feet.

[Remarks.]

Durham County Gaol.

420 DURHAM. Northern Circuit.

Felons have no court; but they have a day-room and two small rooms for an infirmary. The men are put at night into dungeons: one 7 feet square for three prisoners: another, the great holey 16JL feet by 12, has only a little window. In this I saw fix prisoners (in 1776), most of them transports, chained to the floor. In that situation they had been many weeks; and were very sickly. Their straw on the stone floor almost worn to dull. Long confinement, and not having the king's allowance of is. 6d. a week, had urged them to attempt an escape: after which the gaoler chained them as above. There is another dungeon for women-felons 12 feet by 8; and up stairs a separate room or two.

The common-side debtors in the low gaol, whom I saw eating boiled bread and water, told me, that this was the only nourishment some had lived upon for near a twelvemonth. They have from a legacy one shilling and six-pence a week in winter, and one shilling a week in summer for coals. No memorandum of it in the gaol; perhaps this may in time be loft, as the gaoler said two others were, viz. one of bishop Crewe, and another of bishop Wood; from which, prisoners had received no benefit for some years past. But now the bishop has humanely filed bills in chancery and recovered these legacies, by which several debtors have been discharged. — Half a crown a week is paid to a woman for supplying the debtors with water, in the two rooms on the side of the gateway. — The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. The clauses against spirituous liquors are hung up. Gaol delivery once a year. At several of my visits there were boys between thirteen and fifteen years of age, confined with the moil profligate and abandoned.

There was a vacant piece of ground adjacent, of little use but for the gaoler's occasional lumber. It extends to the river, and measures about 22 yards by 16.

I once and again advised the enclosing this for a court: as it might be done with little expence, and it appears that formerly here was a door-way into the prison: but when I was there in January 1776, I had the mortification to hear that the surgeon, who was uncle to the gaoler, had obtained from the bishop, in October preceding, a lease of it for twenty-one years, at the rent of one shilling per annum. He had built a little stable on it-

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at DURHAM,

Was built, as appears by the date over the door, in 1634. Being on the side of a hill, the rooms are airy. No court: now a pump in the prison with good water: the late keeper Watson had a garden which he let for a guinea a year. He lived at the high gaol; and put in a woman to take care of this prison. But the justices since very properly put in a keeper to reside in the prison: he is now dead and his widow is keeper. At my visit in 1779 the house was clean, the prisoners were at work, and their looks bespoke the attention of a good keeper. At my last visit too, the house was very clean. Salary, ^30, and £9: 2: 0 from the rents of the adjoining houses. — Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up.

NEWCASTLE.

IN this Newgate, which is the gate at the upper end of the town, all the rooms except the condemned room are up stairs, and airy.: I always found them remarkably clean, strewed with sand &c. The corporation allow both debtors and felons firing and candles in plenty: and every prisoner has a chaff bed, two blankets, and a coverlet: debtors and felons are thus accommodated in few other prisons in England. They also allow brooms, mops, and all such necessaries. The films generously allowed for those articles, amount to £40: 12: 8 per annum. This is one of the very few gaols that have what is called in London the rules. Part of two streets near the gaol is in the prison-liberty.

The debtors walk on the battery at the top of the gaol, which is 38 feet by 34. There is no court: but one might be made of the vacant ground that lies west of the gaol, at little expence, as the town-wall is on one side of it. The debtors beds are in closets: if on iron bedsteads and in the wards (as in some hospitals) it would be more salutary. — No prisoners here have fetters, unless they be riotous. For some years past, prisoners acquitted have been discharged in court; the corporation paid the gaoler's fees if the prisoners were poor. — Gaol delivery once a year.

I was concerned to find that the humane gaoler Crajler was dead. But his successor Mr. Harle seems equally worthy of the trust.

Dr. Rotheram, a physician in this town, visits the prisoners very assiduously without fee or reward. This is one of the few instances of the kind I have met with.

The act for preserving the health of prisoners was hung up, both on the debtors and felons side. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up.

A palisaded wall is erected at a little distance from the felons window, to prevent files. &c.. being conveyed to them.

Only one court, which is for debtors. Felons are always shut up in the lower. In the women's room I saw (Jan. 1776) two; who, the gaoler said, were call for transportation; one in Sep. 1773, the other in Nov. 1774: but at my visit in 17795 I found they had been humanely released at the assize.

Of the other two rooms, generally appropriated to men-felons, one is a day-room (14 feet 2 inches by 6 feet 9), the other an offensive dungeon, the window only 18 inches by 9. In the latter were three transports (1776) who, upon suspicion of intending an escape, were chained to the floor. They had not the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week.

Gaol delivery once a year. Assize held at Newcastle, whither prisoners are conveyed; and men and women confined together seven or eight nights in a dirty damp dungeon down 6 steps in the old castle, which having no roof, in a wet season the water is some inches deep. The felons are chained to rings in the wall.

debtors: and as many on the common-side. Four of these are 23 feet by 184. They have windows now opening into the court, as well as the street. Where there are Cq^ol' so many rooms, not to separate the men and women is certainly inexcusable.

The wards for felons are two rooms down a step or two; dark and dirty. One of them, the day-room, had a window to the street; through which spirituous liquors and tools for mischief might be easily conveyed: but it is now bricked up. The night-room is only 11 feet by 9: at one of my visits, men and women were lodged together in it. Two rooms over the felons wards, which have been used as tap rooms, seem to be intended for the women only, but in one of these I also found three men and four women lodged together. In the court, near the pump, there is the too common nuisance of a dunghill, which seems to have been accumulating for a year or two.

Transports had not the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week. No infirmary: no bath.

Act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. Prison not white-washed for three years. Gaol delivery once a year. Few gaols have so many convenient rooms for common-side debtors. It is the more remarkable here, because there is no table signed by the magistrates to particularize the free wards. Some gaolers avail themselves of such a circumstance, and demand rent for rooms which were undoubtedly designed for common-side prisoners.

The gaol-fever, which some years ago carried off many of the prisoners, did not deter Mr. FariJI: from visiting the sick every day.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at COCKERMOUTH.

Is behind the keeper's house, and part of it his freehold. A room on the ground-floor, the strong room. Up stairs another room; and a dofet called' the lunatic room.

All out of repair, and insecure: and so is the court, which I suppose is the reason that many for small offences are sent to the county gaol: this being the only county bridewell. No allowance: no straw. Keeper's salary or rent, £20: no fees.

1776, Sep. i8, 1779, May 10, No prisoners.

CARLISLE CITY GAOL,

Over the Scotch-gate. It was only one ruinous room about twenty feet squarej but it has been repaired lately and made more convenient. The window feet by 14.

No allowance, but a very small quantity of peat taken as a toll upon that commodity, and water brought twice a day.

I was told that many a poor traveller from the north, who by some calamity had contracted an unavoidable debt of forty shillings, has been confined at a distance from his friends in this prison, where there is no provision, nor any means of procuring it.

THIS gaol was built by the county. The earl of Thanet is hereditary sheriff, and pays the gaoler his salary. Happily for the prisoners in a gaol so circumstanced, the present gaoler is a man of temper and humanity.

At page ai, I complained of this prison being within reach of floods; but in January 1776, there was a new building on the highest part of the yard. It consists of four vaulted wards for felons, 14^ feet by 13 i a window in each, but no chimney: and over them three good rooms with chimneys, for debtors.

THE castle-yard is spacious, and is supplied with water. Part of it is an enclosed bowling-green. Master's-side debtors have many apartments. One of them which they call the oven, is said to have been used as such in the time of John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster: the diameter, 24 feet; the height, that of an ordinary room. Debtors are allowed to wajk and work (spin, knit, &c.) in the crown and shire halls. The latter is used as a chapel*.

One of the rooms for debtors (60 feet by 27) is a free ward, and called the Quakers room; because, it is said, when those people were so cruelly persecuted in the last century, vast numbers of them were confined in it.

Petty offenders are sometimes sent hither, because the bridewells are distant. There is a large room for them near the gate; and they are kept separate from felons.

Men and women felons have their day-rooms apart, at the upper end of the court. Women sleep in their day-room: but the court being common, the men associate

Over the judge's bench in the shire-hall is this text; "Let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty fir earn."

with them. — Men have for their night-rooms two vaulted cells. One of them, the low dungeon, is 10 steps under ground*, 21 feet by 9, extremely close, dark, and unwholesome; very hot even in winter. Their other cell, the high dungeon (20 feet 2 inches by 11 feet 2,) is close and offensive, though not under ground; and has an iron-latticed door.

In one of these dungeons, there were three felons sick: the recorder, Mr. Fenton, gave immediate orders for their relief by better nourishment, &c. and they soon recovered. No infirmary: no bath. Transports had not the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week. When prisoners are convicted at Preston or Manchester, and from thence brought hither, the gaoler has a shilling a mile conduct-money for each.

If the large liable which is not much used, and the great room under the shire-hall (in which there was only one poor lunatic; who had been there many years, and is since dead) were converted into night-rooms for felons, one small room for each; the court divided, and an infirmary were built, this would be a good gaol. From Mr. Fenton s humanity, and the regard that is justly paid him, I cannot but hope for some of these improvements.

These remarks were made in 1776: at my visit in 1779, I had the pleasure to find fix cells made in the upper liable, 10 feet by 6 feet 8 inches, each having an aperture about 2 feet by 14, and two good rooms fitted up for an infirmary in the dungeon tower. One of the fix cells is appropriated to drunken and riotous debtors, over which this inscription is painted on a board, " This room is for unruly misbehaved " debtors, to be confined in, until they promise to behave well."

At my last visit there were three new cells (10 feet by 6^), two doors in each, one of which was iron-latticed. Here was also a separate closet for women, which is generally wanted in gaols. — This gaol is regularly white-wallied, and kept very clean. The act for preferring the health of prisoners, and the clauses against spirituous liquors, hung up very conspicuously. — The gaoler lives dillant.

The chaplain's salary, .£jo, is from the county; and from the dutchy .£4.

I will give a copy of the table of fees, though it is not authentick; — a list of donations, — and an order for attending divine service, which are hung up in one of the court rooms. — Much good, I hope, may be expected from the exertions now making by the gentlemen of this county, for the further improvement of their prisons.

At the general quarter sessions of the peace held at Lancaster In and for the said county palatine of Lancaster, the 15th day of July in the seventeenth year of king George the third's reign; whereas, it appears to this court on the representation of the keeper of the gaol or the castle of Lancaster, that several prisoners in his custody, being members of the Church of England and having no lawful excuse, make a common practice of absenting themselves from divine service performed in the said gaol, and misbehaving themselves during service. It is therefore ordered by this court, that if any prisoner or prisoners confined in the said castle '(except Roman Catholics and Quakers) and having no lawful excuse, shall absent him her or themselves, from attending divine service within the said castle, or shall in any way misbehave, such prisoner or prisoners shall immediately be deprived of the county allowance until further orders to the contrary. And it is further ordered, that the treasurer of the said county stock, shall immediately upon receiving a complaint from the said keeper against any prisoner or prisoners to strike his her or their name or names out of his books, and to forbear to pay such prisoner or prisoners any more money until further order.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

[Bridewells.]

PRESTON. This prison, a little distant from the town, was a friary. On the ground-floor is a passage, in which are eleven offensive closets, called boxes (6½ feet by 6), to sleep in; and another room, the dungeon. Over these are a large work-room for men, and a less for women. The prison out of repair: but at my visit in 1779, the work-rooms were clean, and the prisoners were spinning worsted. A court in front (of which the prisoners have no use) and a stable; and a spacious garden backwards for the keeper. No bath.

These prisoners have the other moiety of William Edmundson's legacy mentioned in the list at Lancaster Castle. The keeper receives it for them. No water accessible to prisoners: no allowance. Keeper's salary, £60: but the keeper was obliged to pay £50 to his predecessor, who died in 1780; now his salary is augmented to £80 in lieu of the tap. Fees, from those tried at sessions, 10s. 6d. from others, 7s. no table. To this prison in 1778, there were committed 112 prisoners, viz. for felony 14, bastardy 15, misdemeanors 46, vagrants 15, deserters 18, debtors 4. In 1779, there were committed 133: — in 1780, 98; — in 1781, 115; — in 1782, to Sep. 9, 88*.

MANCHESTER. Rebuilt as per date, in the year 1774. Separate courts and apartments for men and women. Two rooms for an infirmary (14 feet by 11 feet 8 inches). The men have work-rooms, over which are chambers. Their four night-rooms or cells in a passage 45 feet by 6, are close; 11 feet by 8; 11 steps below the court; but not properly under ground, being on the declivity of a hill. Women have three rooms on the ground-floor, and three chambers: here is a dungeon, down 9 steps, 14 feet by 13; an inconvenient bath, no water in it. The iron-grate door into each court has a lock and fastenings of a contrivance singularly curious. No allowance. Keeper's salary was raised from £25 to £60, in lieu of fees, and is now raised to £80 in lieu of the tap.

The act for preserving the health of prisoners, and the clauses against spirituous liquors, hung up. The keeper is a chandler, and employs some of the prisoners in spinning candle-wick at three-halfpence a pound. In the front of the prison is

Seven close dungeons in a passage 11 feet wide, 10 steps under ground; each 6½ feet by 5 feet 9 inches, and 6 feet high. Apertures in the doors 11 inches by 6. Three prisoners are commonly locked up in each of them at night. There is another dungeon, larger, but not secure. Only one day-room for criminals of both sexes. No infirmary. The keeper told me in November 1775, that after I was there last year and said his prisoners were in danger of the gaol-fever, twenty-eight of them had been ill of it at one time. What led me to think so was, the offensiveness of the dungeons, and the number of prisoners. The prison is surrounded with other buildings, and cannot be made healthy and convenient‡. Allowance in common on Sunday, bread 4s. beef and broth about 6s. Firing from October to May. Gaoler, Rosendale Allen, sergeant at mace, paid the widow of the late gaoler, £20 a year; and put in a deputy who paid him £65 a year. Fees, debtors, felons &c. 4s. 6d. no table. Chaplain, duty, — Tuesday and Friday: salary, £12: 12: 0.

Felons are generally sent to Lancaster castle: the prisoners kept here are for the most part debtors. The act for preserving the health of prisoners, and the clauses against spirituous liquors, are both hung up.

At my visits in 1779 and 1782, this gaol was much cleaner than at my former visits: the court paved: the act for preserving the health of prisoners hung up; but the unhealthy dungeons still in use. The late surgeon, Mr. Shertcliffe, whose salary was £10 (which is now paid to the dispensary), informed me, that many more had the gaol-fever in 1775, than I mentioned in my publication. The gaoler now is Thomas Lyon: his salary, £10.

The debtors about Christmas receive £10, left by a lady. No memorial in the gaol.

LIVERPOOL Bridewell. This prison was built in 1776, on an eminence adjoining the work-house*, near the town. The men and women have separate rooms, courts, &c. The women have six rooms below, and the same number above: the men have four rooms below, and four above. These are 12 feet by 10, and 8 feet 9 inches high; are furnished with bedsteads, blankets and coverlets; but are too close, having no window, only an aperture in the door about 9 inches square, and another near the ceiling. They have a work-room, 20 feet by 16 feet 9 inches. Near this room in the men's court is a pump, to which the women are tied every week and receive discipline. In this court is also a bath, with a new and singular contrivance. At one end of it was a standard for a long pole, at the extremity of which was fastened a chair. In this all the females (not the males) at their entrance, after a few questions, were placed, with a flannel shift on, and underwent a thorough ducking, thrice repeated — an use of a bath, which I dare say the legislature never thought of, when in their late act they ordered baths with a view to cleanliness and preserving the health of prisoners; not for the exercise of a wanton and dangerous kind of severity. But I was glad to find this use of the bath has been discontinued since my visit in 1779. The severe weekly discipline of the women in the mens court is still continued. — This prison is kept remarkably clean by the matron. All the prisoners were employed in picking oakum. The clauses against spirituous liquors are hung up. Allowance, two-pennyworth of bread a day. Keeper's salary, £30. Matron, £10. Turnkey, 6s. a week, an apartment and firing.

[Remarks.]

THIS castle is the property of the King. The first room is a hall: there are two staircases leading up from it to four rooms for master's-side debtors. Down 18 steps is a small court, which was common to debtors and felons. It is lately divided, but the high close pales which separate the two courts, now so very small, deprive both debtors and felons of the benefit of fresh air, and the keeper has no view of the felons court or day-room, in which men and women are together: the debtors, in the pope's kitchen (improperly called their free ward, as they pay one shilling a week each); the felons, in their day-room, the king's kitchen. Both these are 6 steps below the court: each of them about 35 feet by 22. Near the former is the condemned room. Under the king's kitchen is the king's cellar; quite useless. Under the pope's kitchen is a dark passage 24 feet by 9: the descent to it, is by 21 steps from the court. No window: not a breath of fresh air: only two apertures (lately made) with grates in the ceiling into the pope's kitchen above. On one side of it are six

[Chester Castle.]

cells (stalls) each about 7½ feet by 3, with a barrack-bedstead, and an aperture over the door about 8 inches by 4. In each of these are locked up at night, sometimes three or four felons. They pitch these dungeons two or three times a year: when I was in one of them, I ordered the door to be shut; and my situation brought to mind what I had heard of the black hole at Calcutta.

The felons day-room is not secure. They escaped in 1775, by breaking through the flight floor into the king's cellar below; and through the decayed walls of that they made their way down the hill. The keeper, who is careful and humane, was not blameable.

Transports had not the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week. Of the debtors whom I saw in 1776, five were imprisoned by exchequer writs; and five also in 1782. The costs of some were equal to the debts.

The county has lately built two good rooms for the gaoler, and fitted up one room for a chapel. But there is no infirmary or bath, which are peculiarly necessary in so close a prison. The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up.

The present constable is Mr. Ferdinando Gillio a surgeon in London. He obliges the gaoler to pay rent £30 a year, and takes himself the salary of £18: 5: 0, the gaoler paying the tax of £2: 13: 0 thereon. I need hardly mention the impropriety of one receiving the salary, and another doing the duty*.

* "There is a singularity in the manner of the treatment of the prisoners who are released by capital punishment out of their dreadful cells, which merits mention. They are delivered by the constable or his deputy, at a stone called Glover's-stone, about ninety yards distant from the outward gate, into the hands of the sheriffs of the city; who receive them at that stone, which is the extreme limit of the castle precincts, and from thence convey them to the place of execution, which they also have the charge of."

Mr. Pennant's Tour in Wales, p. 163.

I have in three of my visits seen the place of confinement for deserters in this castle, who are not under the care of the gaoler, but of the invalids of the garrison. It is a bad unhealthy cell; often productive of the gaol-fever; a room should be appropriated to the sick, for the surgeon told me he could not attend them there. An officer at Worcester informed me, that having sent a serjeant and two men for two deserters lodged here, three of them died a few days after they came to their quarters, and he had them buried privately, without military honours, to the surprise of the soldiers, who knew not the reason.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at MIDDLEWICH.

[Bridewell.]

This prison has been improved by the addition of a work-room; a little room at the end of it, which they call a Shop and three chambers over them. At one side of the work-room is a strong brick bench against the wall, long enough for several to fit on: and fronting the fire-place is another brick feat, almost a semicircle. Two of the four lower rooms have now a window in each: the other have only three perforations in the doors of about two inches diameter. I found at my visit in 1776 all the prisoners, but two, employed in picking oakum; the other two were shoe-makers, working at their own trade: but at my two last visits all were without employment. The court is somewhat enlarged from the keeper's garden, and flagged with broad stones, which are very convenient, not only for cleanliness &c. but particularly for drying the oakum. The partition between this and the garden, is a brick wall 6 feet high about one third of the height, and the rest strong palisades with tenter-hooks. This is a judicious contrivance for keeping the court and house airy and healthy: but I since learn this court has been contracted by some new buildings. Allowance to each, six pounds of household bread a week: scale.s and weights are provided by the county. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. Keeper's salary, £50. No fees. A chaplain lately appointed, Rev. Mr. Leigh: salary, £20: duty, three times a week. Surgeon, Mr. Graves: he makes a bill*.

* Since my last visit, the gaol-fever has been in this prison; and in the Chester papers, a testimony to the care, attention, and success of Mr. Graves has been published by order of the justices. The prison was crowded, several having been sent from Chester assizes. However, only three prisoners and a child died.

[Remarks.]

THIS gaol, called the North-gate prison, rebuilt in 1722, has many convenient apartments for debtors. The felons day-room is spacious: but to their dungeon, or night-room (which is 14 feet by 8) the descent is now by 18 steps: for at my visit in 1779, I found that the room was very injudiciously, (not to say cruelly) sunk some feet*. In it is a barrack-bedstead. No light, nor any communication with the external air, but by two leaden pipes of about an inch diameter laid in from the gate-way. The prisoners in March 1774, complained of excessive heat. The women-felons lie up stairs, in a room called the upper dungeon, which has no window, only an aperture in the door (14 inches by 7) into one of the debtors rooms. No bedding or straw. The court is common to debtors and felons: but the former have the privilege of walking in the keeper's garden.

Mr. Price is chaplain to the blue-coat school; and officiates in little St. John's chapel belonging to the school. A navigation parts that from the prison-yard; and a foot-

bridge, made for the purpose, gives these prisoners an opportunity of attending divine service when it is performed; that is, prayers twice a week, and sermon once a month. Few prisoners in city or town gaols have such a privilege.

In November 1775, several prisoners were ill in bed of the cold which then generally prevailed; yet the surgeon had not, for three weeks, either seen them himself, or sent his assistant. No infirmary: nor any convenience, for the proper separation of the sexes (which impropriety the late keeper mentioned).

A legacy of £1: 13: 4 is paid annually by the corporation, but there is no memorial of it in the gaol.

NANTWICH Town Gaol. This prison (called the round house) was built by the county in 1782. Two rooms and a kitchen for the keeper. For prisoners, a room arched with brick (12 feet 3 inches by 10 feet 2), with a barrack-bedstead: no chimney: no court: down 12 steps two dungeons with apertures 12 inches by 9. — The gentlemen seem to have overlooked a clause in 14th Geo.

Only one fire-place, that in the keeper's kitchen.

1782, Nov. 23, No prisoners.

HAULTON Castle Gaol. I should scarcely have mentioned this prison, since for a number of years past no person has been confined in it, had I not found that in an inscription in the court-room, dated 1737, it is still called a gaol with a courtyard. Lord Cholmondeley is proprietor under the crown; and quarterly courts are held here for the manor. Two cellars appear to have been used for the purpose of confining prisoners.

closets, the black holes, in the debtors rooms: they are each 5 feet by with apertures 12 inches by 6 in the doors and were the only receptacles for criminals till a few years ago, when a dungeon in the yard was added, which is 16 feet by 11. This is down 8 steps. A court before it about 5 yards square: water laid in. When men are here, women are put in the dark closets. The clauses against spirituous liquors are hung up. The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up: no infirmary. The debtors and felons not being satisfied with the kind allowance from the county of 1s. 6d. in bread and 6d. in money per week, the justices very properly ordered only a pound of bread a day to each.

Great sessions at Mold: conveyance thither at the gaoler's expence. He has now a salary of £30 as keeper of the bridewell. — There is no work-room nor employment for petty offenders, nor day-room for felons.

About five and twenty years ago, here was a debtor who insisted upon not being subject to the gaoler, nor to any orders but such as should be enjoined by the magistrates. Upon this occasion, as I was informed, the justices at the quarter sessions held at Holywell in July 1759, made some salutary rules for the government of this prison, which are hung up in the gaol. It is probable the man knew he had a statute to support his claim, namely, the act the 32d of George II.

THIS gaol (lately built) is also a county bridewell. In the front are the gaoler's apartments. Backwards, on the ground-floor, a day-room or kitchen for debtors 27 feet by 15; and another as large for criminals: and for the latter, only four cells 7½ feet by 6½; two on each side of a passage but 3 feet wide. The cells are arched with brick, and lined with oak planks. In each there is a bedstead with two blankets and a coverlet. A window in each 3 feet by 1, which was glazed; but being found too close, is now open. In both the debtors and felons day-rooms are 8 cupboards with separate locks and keys, that each may secure his provision. Above are nine rooms for debtors (about 13½ feet by 11½), and a neat chapel, but no free ward. In each of the debtors rooms is an iron bedstead, two chairs, a table, and a fender. Separate courts for debtors and criminals; in each a pump with excellent water, and a bathing-room; with a copper &c. made so convenient that they are in constant use.

Gentlemen so considerate, will scarcely forget an infirmary, and separating women from men, as this is a county bridewell. If a door-way was made between the windows of the felons day-room into their court, they might be more separated from the debtors. — This gaol is kept clean, but has not been white-washed since it was

THIS gaol is finely situated on a rising ground. Here are eight rooms for debtors, three of which are free wards, and two cells 8 feet by 7, and a condemned cell for felons; all clean. No day-room. Court common. The fine stream of water, which at my first visit was running through the court, is turned off. A large brew-house is built for the gaoler. There might be a room over it much more convenient for a chapel than that now used. Great sessions always at Welsh Pool; whither prisoners are conveyed at the gaoler's expence. Act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. The gaol has been white-washed but once since the act passed. No bath, though very conveniently situated for plenty of water.

Debtors are sent from the county-court for small sums, and no term is fixed for their discharge, as is generally ordered in the acts for the court of requests. One was here confined for £1: 11: 6, costs £1: 1: 11, exclusive of the gaoler's fee. The gaoler said, many had been committed for much less sums, and lay for several years in gaol.

Joining to the gaol is a large room, formerly a house of correction, but lately used by strolling players. A court, but no sewer: no water. Neither clauses against spirituous liquors, nor the act for preserving the health of prisoners, are hung up. Great session in Lent at Conway. The gaoler has £5 a year as keeper of bridewell. He stops from each felon's allowance six-pence a week for (what he calls) his trouble of weekly payments. No table of fees.

Among the various improvements that are making in this town, may it not be hoped, that the county-magistrates will think of a better prison.

They were close glazed, but now every pane is broke for air. There is a dungeon down 11 steps. The rooms, and the court (35 feet by 24), were very dirty, which is often the case where there is no water. Neither the act for preserving the health of prisoners, nor clauses against spirituous liquors, are hung up. No allowance from the county, either of bedding or straw, or of fuel. No table of fees.

[Remarks.]

THE old gaol was also the bridewell. Six rooms. The two lowest were very damp dungeons: in one of these, as I was informed, a prisoner lost, first the use of his limbs, and then his life: since that time, none have been confined in either of them. The upper rooms were dirty and offensive, with small windows. No sewers: no court. No table of fees.

But a new gaol is now built within the walls of the old castle. Here are five cells and a kitchen for felons, and a bridewell room for men and five rooms over them for debtors, and a room called the women's bridewell. The cells (12 feet by 6 feet 9 inches) open into a passage feet wide. These cells being four steps under ground and damp, makes it almost absolutely necessary to have bedsteads. Here is a chapel: but there is no infirmary or bath. There is a fine well of water in the spacious court. A pump is necessary, for wells and ropes are dangerous in gaols. Neither the act for preserving the health of prisoners, nor clauses against spirituous liquors, were hung up.

Mr. Martha Bowen declared in her will, that £100 had been deposited in her hands by an unknown person, about the year 1751, for the benefit of insolvent debtors, and the poor; which said sum of £100 was invested in New South Sea annuities

in trust to the rectors of St. Mary's Haverfordwest. The present rector, the Rev. Charles Ayleway very wisely distributes the interest, in bread weekly, a sixpenny loaf to each poor debtor, and the remainder in twopenny loaves to the poor in the town.

At HAVERFORDWEST is also the

Town and County Gaol; which is likewise the bridewell. Two rooms below, one for debtors, the other for felons. The bridewell, a room above (13½ feet by 13). No court: no water. Gaoler, R. Griffith the county gaoler. No salary.

[Remarks.]

CARMARTHEN CASTLE.

THIS gaol is also the county bridewell. Both the old and new cells for criminals are too close, about 7 feet by 6: apertures in the doors only 8 inches square: earth floors. The day-room is used as a chapel. Over it is a free ward: and over that a room for the sick. The condemned dungeon is damp; a small window. One courtyard; but it is spacious. A house of four rooms on a floor for the gaoler, lately built in the court; but he still lives distant, as before: it has convenient rooms for master's-side debtors; and an alarm-bell at top: by ringing it, a debtor prevented an escape of the felons. No water: the well is useless; and the gaol offensive. Water might be laid in from a conduit at a little distance, for which the debtors have frequently petitioned the Bench, but in vain. Transports had not the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week. The act for preserving the health of prisoners, and clauses against spirituous liquors, are not hung up. No table of fees. J. Williams has £11: 12: 0 a year as keeper of bridewell. To this prison there are rules or bounds, which extend about half a mile round.

Two of the offenders, whom I saw in 1776, were for fines which they could not pay. They had not the county allowance, and were almost starved.

The gaoler was desirous of farming the allowance: but the abuse of such a trust by the gaoler at Brecon had been detected; and the request of this gaoler was not granted.

At two of my visits, here were a number of idle and profane people playing at tennis*.

At CARMARTHEN is also the

COUNTY-BOROUGH-GAOL.

To the four rooms of this gaol at the gate, there is an ascent by stone steps on the outside. No court: no water. Keeper, one of the town sheriffs, lives distant. At my first visit, a young creature committed for a petty theft had been there four months, and was sick on the floor. At another visit, a debtor sick in bed. Besides the four prisoners whom I saw in 1776, the sheriff told me he had one in the rules; for here, as in the county gaol, debtors who give security, have the privilege of the rules; for which they pay the gaoler a guinea each, and the same on the appointment of every sheriff. Food, &c. for the prisoners was put through an aperture at the bottom of the tloor: a little girl, the daughter of a prisoner, could just get through it to fetch water, &c. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. — At my two last visits, very dirty, and full of vermin. Fees, debtors 13s. 4d.

THIS gaol is also the county bridewell. At my last visit I found some alteration. Besides the keeper's apartments, there are now five rooms and a hall for debtors, two of which (18 feet by 12) are new, but no free ward; a cell for criminals (11½ feet by 6), and a day-room. No straw. Down three steps is a damp dungeon, which I hope is never used. The bridewell room (11½ feet by 10½) has no window. The keeper's garden is now taken into the court, but debtors are not separated from felons. There are still wanted two rooms for criminals, an infirmary and bath, and casements to the windows, they being all close glazed. Neither clauses against spirituous liquors, nor the act for preserving the health of prisoners, are hung up: no table of fees. The gaoler has £2 a year as bridewell keeper.

A day-labourer, who had a wife and two small children, was confined here from the county court, for a debt of only 9s. costs, 6s. 8d. gaoler's fee, 3s. 4d.

[Remarks.]

THIS gaol was out of repair. Two courts common to debtors and felons: they also lodged together. A dark dungeon. At my first visit the prisoners were almost starved by the gaoler. Two gentlemen of the county, who were then in the gaol with me, resented the abuse. — No draw. — No clauses of act against spirituous liquors: no table of fees. Transports had not the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week.

At my visit in 1779, a new gaol and bridewell was building out of the town, near the river, and I then observed that the situation was too low, so that sometimes it may be exposed to floods. — In 1782 it was finished. There are five rooms above for debtors, two of which are free wards: a day-room for men-felons (26½ feet by 14), into which two cells open, and in the front court a lodging-room. In another court five rooms or cells, about 6½ feet by 4½, and 8 feet high. — For women a separate court, a day-room, five lodging-rooms; and two rooms for the sick. A chapel, with a bell over it. The courts are properly paved with flag-stones. — The water has been three feet high in the cells by a flood, but some precautions are taken to prevent it for the future. — This new gaol is not kept clean; fowls and dogs were in the courts.

Here were hung up printed clauses from several acts of parliament made for the regulation of prisons; and also, the following rules for the Breconshire gaol.

[Remarks.]

THE new gaol is finished and consists of three separate buildings with courts between them. The rooms for debtors and a chapel are in the front where the old gaol stood, behind which is a court with water: then the gaoler's house, which has two rooms on a floor. At the back of this is the felons court and beyond that their wards consisting of three vaulted rooms, and a room for the turnkey. Above, are three chambers. No infirmary. No water in the felons court. — The gaoler's house being in the middle, he might have the felons court as well as the debtors constantly in view, if two windows were made in the upper rooms: but his passing to the street through the debtors house, may be dangerous to him when they prove riotous. — The gaoler undertakes for £40 a year to pay a shilling a week to such debtors as the justices shall appoint*. — Great sessions always at Cowbridge. — Neither the act for preserving the health of prisoners, nor clauses against spirituous liquors, were hung up.

At my visit in 1779 I found the following table of fees hung up, but signed only by the justices: at my last visit there was no table.

Glamorganshire. A Table of Fees and Chamber Rent to be taken by the Gaoler and also the Rates he shall impose on each Prisoner that makes use of the Gaoler's Bed and Bedding, and Directions for his Government of the Prison and Prisoners in his Custody, made in pursuance of the Statute in that case made and provided.

£. S. D.

To the gaoler or turnkey at the receiving each prisoner into his custody, and which shall be paid by such prisoner before he is discharged - 0 1 0.

To the gaoler upon the discharge of each prisoner - 0 6 8.

For the lodging of each prisoner in either of the fore-street chambers (the largest of which shall contain no more than three beds and the other two beds) such prisoner finding his own bedding and bed cloaths each night, seven farthings - 0 0 1¾.

For the lodging of each prisoner in either of the fore-street chambers when the gaoler finds such prisoner with a sufficient feather bed, bolster and bed cloaths, three pence halfpenny per night - 0 0 3½.

For the lodging of each prisoner in either of such fore-street rooms at the gaoler's finding a flock bed, dust bed, or other coarse ordinary bed and bed cloaths, two pence halfpenny per night - 0 0 2½.

For the lodging of each prisoner in any or either of the other chambers or rooms in the gaol, when the gaoler finds such prisoner with a sufficient feather bed, bolster and bed cloaths, two pence per night - 0 0 2.

For a flock, dust, or other ordinary bed and bedding, one penny per night - 0 0 1.

That all the prisoners in his custody shall be at liberty to send out of the gaol for what victuals and drink they think fit, gratis; and that the gaoler for the time being shall not by compulsion or otherwise oblige any prisoner in his custody to buy any meat or drink of him, but if the prisoners or any or either of them shall out of choice deal with such gaoler for their provision of other thing, that then such gaoler shall supply such prisoners with sufficient provisions and drink at reasonable rates.

* A late gaoler informed me, that an exchequer debtor confined ten years for seven pounds, died in the gaol just before I was there.

464 GLAMORGANSHIRE. South Wales Circuit.

[Cardiff County Gaol.]

That if any difference should happen to arise between the gaoler and prisoners with regard to the goodness of the beds or bed cloaths or the goodness and price of the provisions the gaoler shall find such prisoners with, that then such difference shall be submitted to the arbitration of the treasurer of the said county for the time being, who is hereby desired, and as far as we can, empowered, to settle and adjust such differences and give such relief therein as shall be reasonable and just to the party grieved, and if it shall happen that either party shall think himself aggrieved by such adjustment, he may appeal from such order or determination as such treasurer shall make in the matter to the next General Quarter Sessions of the Peace to be holden for the said county.

In order to enforce the prisoners in the said gaol to pay duly and regularly for such chambers as they shall take, or such beds, bed cloaths, meat and drink as such gaoler shall find them with at the prices and in manner aforesaid, We do hereby give the gaoler, upon their neglect and refusal of payment for one whole month together, liberty to turn them out of their said rooms and chambers into the common rooms, until such time that they shall have fully and bona fide paid what shall be so due from them to the said gaoler.

Besides the old room towards the street, now seldom used, there are two rooms built in the back court; each 15 feet square. In them provision is made for the circulation of air; for besides the window, there are 5 apertures of about a foot diameter in each room. The late keeper told me, many had died of the gaol-fever: a man and woman about a year before; when himself and his daughter were also ill of it. Court not secure. No allowance: no employment.

I know not how to close this account of prisons without making the following observation. In all my journies, by night and day, through all the different counties of England (for ten years past) I have never once been stopped, or even known myself in any great danger from robbers. I mention this, (with a devout acknowledgment of a kind providence!) because foreigners In this country generally travel interror, and often give dismal accounts of the dangers they have encountered.

HULKS. 465

HULKS on the THAMES.

[Hulks.]

In my first edition (page 75), I passed some censures on the management of convicts committed to hard labour on the Thames; and in a subsequent visit I was still more convinced of the faults I had observed. The effects of these became so alarming, as to attract the notice of parliament. A public inquiry was instituted, by which it appeared, that from August 1776, when the convicts were first put on board the Justicia, to March 26, 1778, out of six hundred and thirty-two prisoners who had been received, one hundred and seventy-six had died. — It is with pleasure that I can give an account, which will shew in a striking light the beneficial effects of this Parliamentary Inquiry as to the health of the prisoners, and the obligations the public were under to the committee appointed on this occasion, and particularly to its chairman, Sir Charles Bunbury.

At my visit, Nov. 16, 1779, there were at Woolwich, for the reception of convicts, an old Indiaman, called the Justicia; and a frigate, the Censor. In the former were two hundred and fifty-six; and in the latter, two hundred and fifty. That which was first called the Justicia, is converted into an hospital ship, in which were twenty patients. — Another, called the Reception, was empty: in this, convicts were examined by the surgeon, and continued three days, before they were sent either to the hulks, or to the hospital ship*.

The prisoners on board the Justicia looked healthy and well: the decks were clean. They had bedding; their provisions were good of the sort; and there were not any (as at my former visits) without shoes and stockings. — I found the Censor, below deck, cleaner than the Justicia; yet, on carefully viewing the convicts, they had not so healthy and contented an aspect as those in the other; and a much greater proportion of this ship's company was sent to the hospital. This created in me a suspicion that something was wrong. I examined all their provisions, bedding, &c. and found that they were the same as on board the Justicia. It would be highly proper that a table of their stated allowance should be hung up, and scales, weights, and measures assigned them†, to check the pursers who give out their provision‡. In the hospital ship, on the two decks (one of which is for recovering patients) were

[Hulks.]

twenty-five cradles, but smaller than those in the royal hospitals at Haslar and Plymouth, where all lie single. Of the few who were very sick, I found their irons were off. The cleanliness and quietness of the hospital did honour to the conductor. It is to be wished that the patients had better nourishment, as that in many cases would be more salutary than medical prescriptions.

There were about one hundred and fifty at work in the warren in 1779; most of them clothed in a brown uniform. I observed that the situation of these unhappy people was altered for the better. Yet their bread allowance of one pound a day was too little, especially for those who worked, although they had an extra allowance of beer.

At my visit, Dec. 27, 1782, the Censor and the Reception were laid up. There were on board the Justicia one hundred and eighty convicts, and in the hospital ship twenty-four. Of these, one hundred and sixteen were employed in removing ballast, planking, &c. on shore, and thirty-six were heaving ballast in the lighters. The hospital ship was very clean; the other not dirty.

Some alteration is made in the bread allowance. The mess of six men is now 7lb. The diet table is hung up in the cabin of the Justicia*. I could wish it were for the inspection of the convicts, and that scales and weights were provided for them. There should be to each bed in winter an additional blanket.

Oct. 19, 1783†, there were on board the Justicia one hundred and seventy-two, and in the hospital ship twenty-two. The men in the Justicia looked well, which I doubt not was in a great measure owing to their being employed, and also restrained from spirituous and other strong liquors. Of late, but few of them have died: this shews that their situation is better with respect to health; but the association of so many criminals is utterly destructive to morals.

* A Table of Diet expended by the Convicts on board the Justicia hulk daily.

Each mess is for six men, with seven pounds of bread everyday.

Breakfast. Every day; a pint of barley or rice made into three quarts of soup.

Dinner. Sunday. Six pounds of salt pork or seven pounds of beef, with five quarts of beer.

Dinner. Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Six pounds of bullock's head.

Dinner. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Two pounds of cheese, and five quarts of beer.

Supper. Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. A pint of pease and barley made into three quarts of soup.

Supper. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. A pint of oatmeal made into burgou.

† The Censor had one hundred and thirty seven convicts for our settlements; many of whom being sickly objects, and in want of clothes and bedding, I was persuaded would die in the passage. My mind reverted to the Portuguese method with their convicts for India. (See page 150.) It is, surely, disgraceful for this nation to be outdone in humanity and attention to prisoners by so many of our neighbours.

GAOL-FEVER. 467

REMARKS

ON THE

GAOL-FEVER.

[Gaol-Fever.]

I shall take the liberty here to subjoin a few additional remarks on the gaol-fever; in which, if I shall appear to have invaded the province of the gentlemen of the faculty, I hope to be pardoned, from the consideration that my experience in this matter, may in some respect supply my want of other means of knowledge.

If it were asked, what is the cause of the gaol-fever? it would in general be readily replied, "the want of fresh air and cleanliness." But as I have found in some prisons abroad, cells and dungeons as offensive and dirty as any I have observed in this country, where, however, this distemper was unknown, I am obliged to look out for some additional cause for its production. I am of opinion, that the sudden change of diet and lodging so affects the spirits of new convicts, that the general causes of putrid fevers exert an immediate effect upon them. Hence it is common to see them sicken and die in a short time, with very little apparent illness. Convicts are generally stout robust young men, who have been accustomed to free diet, tolerable lodgings, and vigorous exercise. These are ironed, and thrust into close offensive dungeons, and there chained down, some of them, without straw or other bedding; in which they continue, in winter, sixteen or seventeen hours out of the twenty-four, in utter inactivity, and immersed in the noxious effluvia of their own bodies. On this account, the gaol-distemper is always observed to reign more in our prisons during winter than summer*; contrary, I presume, to the nature of other putrid diseases. Their diet is at the same time low and scanty; they are generally without firing; and the powers of life soon become incapable of refilling so many causes of sickness and despair.

* In conversation with the physician to the military hospital at Moscow, on my observing that the windows of the wards were shut; he answered, " Almost all our disorders are in winter, for the Russians enclose themselves in hot rooms, and dislike the fresh air, even before the cold months commence."

468 GAOL-FEVER.

[Gaol-Fever.]

On my visits in 1779, I found only one person ill of the gaol-fever: he was in Newgate, under sentence of death. In 1782, I did not find a single person labouring under that disorder throughout the whole kingdom. But in 1783, when the prisons became crowded from the peace, I was sorry to observe, that through the original faulty construction of many of them, and the want of attention in magistrates properly to inspect them, and enforce the orders of the act for preserving the health of prisoners, they were beginning to return to their former wretched state.

Several instances of alarming and fatal sickness in gaols have since been communicated to me; some of which I have noted in their proper places. I have to remark, however, that it appears doubtful to me, whether, in some of these, the disorder was the proper gaol-fever, produced in and peculiar to such situations; or an epidemic disease, which attacked prisoners only in common with other inhabitants of the same town. It cannot be expected that gaols should be preserved free from such visitations as these; it is only to be hoped, that care and attention will be used, to prevent the disease from becoming more malignant and fatal in these, than in other places*.

* It may not be improper here to put persons on their guard against an artifice not unfrequently practised by gaolers, in order to prevent a proper examination of their prisons. When a gentleman, particularly a magistrate, has come with an intention to visit the gaol, the keeper has pretended the utmost willingness to accompany him, but at the same time has artfully dropt a hint that he fears there may be some danger in it, as he is apprehensive that the fever has made its appearance among them. The visitor, alarmed, returns thanks for the kind caution, and instantly leaves the house — On such occasions I have always the more insisted on the necessity of a dose inspection; and have generally found the prison very dirty, indeed, and out of order, but no fever.

CONCLUSION. 469

CONCLUSION.

It was once my intention to have published the preceding account of English prisons, without any of the introductory matter which composes the former part of this volume. But thinking, from a close attention to the subject, that it was in my power in some instances to suggest remedies to the evils of which I had been witness; and aware of the common proverbial objection "that it is easier to find faults than to mend them;" I imagined I should be culpable in suppressing any thing which might conduce to improvement in a matter I had so much at heart.

A person of more ability, with my knowledge of facts, would have written better: but the object of my ambition was not the same of an author. Hearing the cry of the MISERABLE, I devoted my time to their relief. In order to procure it, I made it my business to collect materials, the authenticity of which could not be disputed. For the warmth of some expressions where my subject obliges me to complain, and for my eagerness to remove the several grievances, my apology must be drawn from the deep distress of the sufferers, and the impression the view of it made upon me — An impression: too deep to be effaced by any length of time!

What I have proposed throughout my work is liable, I am sensible, to some objections; and these will, doubtless, be heightened by the cavils of those whose interest it is to prevent the reformation of abuses on which their ease or emolument may depend. Yet I hope not to be entirely deserted in the conflict: and if this publication should be the means of exciting the attention of my countrymen to this IMPORTANT NATIONAL CONCERN — of alleviating the distresses of poor debtors and other prisoners — of procuring for them cleanly and wholesome abodes; and exterminating the gaol-fever, which has so often spread abroad its dreadful contagion — of abolishing, or at least reducing, the oppressive fees of clerks of assize, and of the peace — of preventing the sale of liquors in prisons — of checking the impositions of gaolers, and the extortions of bailiffs — of introducing a habit of industry into our bridewells; and restraining the shocking debauchery and immorality which prevail in our gaols and other prisons - if any of these beneficial consequences shall accrue, the writer will be happy in the pleasing reflection that he has not lived without doing some good to his fellow-creatures; and will think himself abundantly repaid for all the pains he has taken, the time he has spent, and the hazards he has encountered.

TABLE I.

GENERAL HEADS OF REGULATIONS

PROPOSED TO BE ESTABLISHED IN

PENITENTIARY HOUSES

OR

HOUSES OF CORRECTION.

Should the design of erecting Houses of Correction on an enlarged and improved plan, similar to that in the excellent Act 19th George III. drawn up by Sir William Blackstone and Mr. Eden, be carried into execution; it will be a most important object to frame a set of regulations for their proper government. In order to facilitate the consideration of this point, I have put down under a few general heads, those circumstances which appear to me most deserving of attention; examples of which, carried into practice, may be found in different parts of my book.

I shall in the first place, however, declare my opinion, that no regulations will, in reality, be executed with due care and attention, if these houses are not erected so near the Metropolis or other capital towns, as to be easily accessible by those who may be entrusted with the inspection of them. And this appears to me a matter of so much consequence, as to overbalance every consideration which might be supposed to render a different situation more eligible.

Table IX. Continued.

The respective Offences.

Of the hundred and twenty Sessions in the fifteen Years of Peace (eight in a Year) only one was Maiden; in 1749. — Of the sixty-four Sessions in the eight Years of War, nine were Maiden.

Sir Stephen intending a list only of those who were condemned to die, has not in his table a column for transport convicts. But at the bottom of the sheet he notes that there were

Transported for seven or fourteen years - 5199

To which number he adds

Transported by the King's mercy (after receiving sentence of death) 401

Total Transports 5600

The second number of transports 401 is, doubtless, part of the number 443, the last of the three totals above.

When I referred to this Table in page 9, I mentioned that the Copper-plate was in my possession. I now add, that if any Gentleman, who has leisure and inclination to study the subject, is desirous of a copy, one is much at his service.

TABLE XII.

An Account of the Number of Prisoners in the Gaols and Prisons of England and Wales, at the Time they were visited in 1779, and 1782.

As some County gaols are also the county bridewells, where petty offenders are not always separated from felons; in those places I sometimes include petty offenders under the article felons &c. The reason of my distinguishing the women debtors, is to shew that a room or two (appropriated by the magistrates) in the gaoler's house may probably be sufficient for them, instead of a separate ward, as proposed in my general plan for a county gaol {edit. 1.) — In this table I have omitted mentioning all those prisons in which, at the times of my visiting in those two years, there were no persons confined. Where a blank is left opposite a name, it signifies that the prison was not visited that year.

Though I have visited all the County Gaols, and almost all the other prisons; yet as there are some few of the corporation prisons which I did not fee, I have added sixty more prisoners to the number in 1779, and thirty in 1782; so that probably, we have nearly the average number of persons confined at one time in the prisons of this kingdom. I

I subjoin the Numbers, confined in the London Prisons and in the Hulks*, at the time they were visited in
