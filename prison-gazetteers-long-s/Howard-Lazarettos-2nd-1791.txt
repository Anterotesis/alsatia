INTRODUCTION.

IN my latest tours, I had with pain observed, that notwithstanding the regulations which had been made in our own country, and elsewhere, for preserving health in prisons and hospitals, yet that infectious diseases continued occasionally to arise and spread in them. I had also been led, by the view of several lazarettos in my travels, to consider how much all trading nations are exposed to that dreadful scourge of mankind which those structures are intended to prevent, and to reflect how very rude and imperfect our own police was with respect to this object. It likewise struck me, that establishments, effectual for the prevention of the most infectious of all diseases, must afford many useful hints for guarding against the propagation of contagious distempers in general. These various considerations induced me, in the last edition of The State of the Prisons, &c. to express a wish, "that some future traveller would give us plans of the lazarettos at Leghorn, Ancona and other places." At length I determined to procure these plans, and acquire all the necessary information respecting them, myself: and towards the end of the year 1785, I went abroad for the purpose of visiting the principal lazarettos in France and Italy. To the physicians employed in them, I proposed a set of queries respecting the nature and prevention of the plague; but their answers not affording satisfactory instruction, I proceeded to Smyrna and Constantinople. For, although the subjects of the Turkish empire be little enlightened by the modern improvements in arts and sciences, I conceived that from their intimate acquaintance with the disease in question, and from the great difference between their customs and manners, and ours, some practices might be found among them, and some information gained, not unworthy the notice of more polished nations. I also pleased myself with the idea, not only of learning, but of being able to communicate somewhat to the inhabitants of these distant regions, if they should have curiosity enough to inquire, and liberality to adopt the methods of treating and of preventing contagious diseases which had been found most successful among ourselves.

2 INTRODUCTION.

Such were my views. That merciful Providence which had hitherto preferred me, was pleased to extend its protection to me in this journey also.

One consequence of my inquiries has been a full conviction of the importance, to this country, of properly-constituted lazarettos; and this, too, for commercial reasons, of which, I confess, I had before no idea. The circumstances from which I drew this conclusion will be found in their proper places in the narrative; for I shall in this publication, as I did in my former ones, confine myself chiefly to the narration of facts. What attention these facts deserve, and what measures it may be adviseable to adopt in consequence of them, I leave to the determination of the proper judges.

Upon my return from the Levant, I was solicitous to know what improvements had been made in our prisons during my absence, and how far the numerous abuses and defects which I had laid before the public had been redressed. Therefore, after visiting the London prisons and the Hulks, I went to Ireland, and, returning by way of Scotland, travelled over a great part of England.

It is not my intention to transcribe my whole journal, and minutely relate all I saw. When I first printed my review of prisons, a particular and explicit account seemed necessary, on a subject so new to the public, and where so many things wanted alteration. Many changes for the better have been made, and are still making, of which I shall gladly give the reader an account; and it will be my duty also to note what I have found still needing reformation. Of these two parts of my business, I beg it may be believed, that with reluctance I censure, but commend with pleasure.

LAZARETTOS.

SECTION I.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE

PRINCIPAL LAZARETTOS IN EUROPE.

[Marseilles Health-Office.]

THE first Lazaretto I visited was at Marseilles. The Health-office, Le Bureau de Santé, is in the city at the end of the port. It has an outer room and two council chambers. In the outer room, the depositions of captains of ships are taken, who come in their boats to an iron grate. At two feet distance there is an iron lattice with a door, which is opened only by the servants of the intendants, or directors, who are here in waiting, in a blue livery trimmed with white lace. Here also fetters, or orders for supplies, from the captains who are performing quarantine in their ships, are received with a pair of iron tongs, and dipped in a bucket of vinegar standing ready for that purpose. Over the book in which the depositions of the captains are inserted for public view, there is hung up an advertisement, to desire that the leaves may not be torn, and if they be torn, that information may be given to the office. In this room were hung up also orders, that when captains are examined, none but those who belong to the office shall be present; and that captains of merchant ships, who have no bills of health, shall be obliged themselves to perform quarantine in the lazaretto.

In the first of the two council chambers, there were hung up a plan of the lazaretto, and the picture of a person dying of the plague; also the names of the directors, and the weeks of their attendance. Two or more of them are present every day to take the depositions of the captains as they arrive, to fix the guards and porters, and for the other business of this extensive lazaretto.

[Lazaretto.]

The lazaretto is on an elevated rock near the city, at the end of the bay, fronting the south-west, and commands the entrance of the harbour. It is very spacious, and its

4 LAZARETTOS. Sect. I.

[Marseilles Lazaretto.]

situation renders it very commodious for the great trade which the French carry on in the Levant. Among other apartments for passengers, there are twenty-four large rooms, of which some are above stairs, and open into a spacious gallery enclosed by lattice. In these rooms ,are closets for beds, which the passengers and guards are required to bring with them. The guards are sent by the Health-office, and their number is regulated by the number of passengers of each ship who perform quarantine. A number of passengers, not exceeding three, are allowed one guard, the expense of whom (namely twenty sous per day and his victuals) they are obliged to bear. A passenger, therefore, who has no companion, has no assistance in bearing this expense. To four, five, or six passengers, two guards are assigned; and to seven, three guards. These guards perform the offices of servants; and will cook for passengers, if they do not choose to have their victuals from the tavern.

Within the lazaretto, is the governor's house; and a chapel, in which divine service is regularly performed; as also a tavern, from which persons under quarantine may have their dinners and suppers sent them, and which has likewise the exclusive privilege of supplying them with wine. Two days before the quarantine is finished, the bills are sent in which being paid to the cashier, they receive a clean patent.*

The quarantine of passengers who come with a foul bill, or in one of the two first ships from the same place with a clean bill, is thirty-one days, including the day they go out. If any account arrive of the plague having broke out in the place from which they came with a clean bill, after they left it, they are allowed no advantage from their clean bill; for, in this case, they must be confined fifteen days, and also fumigated† before they come down stairs, and are permitted to go to the parloirs. In case any of the company to which they belong die, their quarantine recommences.

[Parloirs.]

The parloirs are long galleries with seats in them, situated between the gates, and separated by wooden balustrades and wire lattice, beyond which there are other balustrades, distant about ten feet, at which the persons in quarantine may see and converse with such friends as may choose to visit them. The wires are intended to prevent any thing from being handed to them, or from them. And that nothing may be thrown over, and no escapes be made, there is a double wall round the lazaretto.

At the gate there is a bell to call any person in this enclosure; and by the number and other modifications of the strokes, every individual knows when he is called.

The ships are moored at the isle of Pomeque, where a governor resides, and other officers, to keep the crews of ships in order, and prevent them from having any communication.

* If bills are overcharged, there are magistrates in the city who should examine and tax them: but these magistrates do not always discharge their duty. The chaplain of the Dutch consul at Smyrna applied to them, as many others have done, without obtaining redress.

† The fumigation is three times repeated, at the expense of nine livres, and by many is thought unnecessary. It was not used in the lazarettos at Venice.

Sect. I. LAZARETTOS. 5

[Marseilles Lazaretto.]

cation.* From thence, goods are conveyed to the lazaretto in large boats kept for that purpose. Cottons with a foul bill must remain on deck six days; and the next six days, the first bales must remain on the bridge in the lazaretto, before any others can be received by the porters;† after this, the cargo of that ship is brought in. But if the ship have a clean bill, it is unloaded much quicker, and subject only to twenty days quarantine: unless it be one of the two first ships, or there have been an account that the plague had broke out after it had sailed from the port where it was loaded, in which case, it is obliged to perform quarantine as before said of passengers. And if the plague be in other cities of the Levant, five days are added to the twenty days of the quarantine; this the French called pied de mouche. The bales of cotton are exposed to the open air; and every ten days, a seam of the bags is opened. Precious goods are placed in warehouses with open balustrades for the air to pals freely.‡

[Genoa Lazaretto.]

At Genoa, the lazaretto is situated on the sea shore, near the city, and detached from other buildings. The plan is regular; the centre-row equally dividing the areas, which are three hundred and ten feet by twenty-five. In the middle of one of the areas there is a little chapel, which has three sides open, that the elevation of the host may be seen in the opposite rooms.

At the entrance there is a guard-room for ten soldiers, and a spacious bake-house. Towards the areas are many vaulted rooms for passengers, which open into a corridor, where there are doors to separate the passengers of different ships. These rooms are

* Sometimes the governor is obliged to send some of the French sailors to the prison in the lazaretto, because, having no pay during their quarantine, they are often quarrelsome.

† The porters are, in like manner with the guards, sent by the office, as ships arrive. Their number is proportioned to the cargo; and four are allowed to a common ship.

‡ The French in every ship have a secretary, who always performs his quarantine on shore, and sees that none of the effects of different persons are mixed or embezzled by the porters. He sometimes acts as doctor, and is otherwise useful on board. Such a secretary I also found in a ship.

The admission of persons to visit the lazaretto at Marseilles is strictly prohibited: but I have the pleasure of giving the first engraved plan of it. See plate I. The scale is of French feet. And as I shall have occasion in other plans to mention the feet of different countries, I here give their proportions.

If the French foot be divided into 1440 equal parts;

The foot

in England is 1351 of those parts.

at Amsterdam is 1258 of those parts.

Bern is 1300 of those parts.

Florence is 2440.95 of those parts.

in Greece is 1360 of those parts.

at Rome is 1306 of those parts.

in Spain is 1240 of those parts.

at Venice is 1540 of those parts.

Vienna is 1401.3 of those parts.

[Genoa Lazaretto.]

fifteen feet and seven inches, by fourteen feet, three inches, and eleven feet and a half high. The corridor is ten feet and nine inches wide, and is separated from the areas by high wooden palisades. Above stairs there are thirty-six rooms in front, besides twelve belonging to the prior or governor. On one side there are eleven, and on the other, ten rooms. All the rooms are nearly similar in length and breadth, about sixteen feet, nine inches, by fourteen feet, nine, and eleven feet, six inches high; with two opposite windows, about four feet by three, and six feet above the floor. The windows of all the rooms are too small. The floors are brick, and the roofs vaulted. Each room has in one corner, a chimney, and in another, a sewer shut in like a closet. These rooms open into a corridor eleven feet wide, which has spacious windows towards the areas, and doors which can shut up three or four rooms according to the number of passengers from each ship. All the windows have iron bars and shutters, but none are glazed. Adjoining to the back of the governor's apartments is a neat and convenient chapel. When a considerable number are confined by sickness, the chaplain resides in the governor's apartments; and then the physician and surgeon are also obliged to reside in their rooms, at the corner of one of the areas.

On the second floor there are ranges of warehouses. These are too narrow, being only sixteen feet and a half wide; and the windows are too small, being, on one side, only two feet square; and on the other, three feet, by two feet, nine inches. The floors are of stone; but such floors are improper; white bricks, well burnt, being best for goods, because less apt to become damp. To these warehouses there are spacious brick ascents on the outside, on which bales of cotton are opened and aired. The doors are single; but large folding doors would have been better; and there should have been a small partition in each of the warehouses, that the porters might pass with less danger of infection. The stair-cases in the inside leading to these warehouses, and to those on the first floor, are like-wise too narrow, being only three feet and a half wide.

In the centre, behind the chapel, there are two spacious rooms, one hundred and twenty-five feet, by twenty-five. The ascent for bales is good, being ten feet wide; but the door way is only four feet wide. These would make good rooms for the sick; being fresh and airy, and having each twenty windows, with shutters to them, and without glass.

There are in the front three towers, or elevated rooms. That in the middle is called the governor's, because it adjoins to his apartments. From the windows he has a full view of both the areas and corridors. But this lazaretto derives a peculiar advantage from a fine spring of water which comes from the mountains, and contributes much to its salutariness. The channel is full six feet wide at its entrance into the area, and this renders it very convenient for washing linen. Being also property conducted through all the sewers, it prevents the rooms from being offensive.

There are three prison-rooms, intended for riotous sailors who may be sent from the quarantine ships, and for the guards and porters, should they happen to be disorderly,

[Genoa.]

or guilty of embezzlement. The chief punishment is solitary confinement; and these rooms are not ill suited to this purpose.* See plates II. III. †

[Spezia Lazaretto.]

Another lazaretto, belonging to the Genoese, is situated on a rising ground at Varignano, near the gulf or noble port of Spezia. Here ships ride safe in fourteen feet of water, and have every convenience for landing their cargoes. Having been minute in my account of the lazaretto at Genoa, I will give no description of this. The plan and views of it will give sufficient information concerning it.‡ See plates IV. V. VI.

[Leghorn Lazarettos.]

At Leghorn there are three lazarettos. One of them is new. I was there in 1778, and saw forty-seven slaves employed in building it.‖ Ships which have the plague on board are now received here, and not chased away or burnt, as is practised in too many places. The greatest attention is given both to the health and convenience of the passengers, and the merchandise is kept in the exactest order. This lazaretto is called San Leopoldo, in compliment to the present Grand Duke; and at the upper end of one of the courts is placed his statue. The repeated visits I have paid to his prisons, hospitals, &c. have given me the fullest conviction that he is the true father and friend of his country.

The very worthy governor of the city, Federigo Barlolani, did me the favour to accompany me to this new lazaretto, and to that of San Rocco. He also favoured me with the plans of the three lazarettos (two of which I have copied, plates VII. VIII.) and with the regulations, &c. which He published in quarto 1785, entitled Ordini di sanità. The Grand Duke, before the publication of these regulations, had sent a person to the Levant, on purpose to gain information by returning from thence and performing quarantine at Marseilles, and there making the most careful observations. Our ambassador at Constantinople. Sir Robert Ainslie,§ told me, that the lazarettos at Leghorn are the best in Europe. This was confirmed to me by two gentlemen who had performed quarantine both there, and at Marseilles.

* This lazaretto has a double wall like that at Marseilles. Between the walls there is a burying-ground for Protestants, but no tomb-stones or inscriptions are allowed. Here our late consul Mr. Halford was interred. And while I was at Genoa, a Scotch Tailor died in the great hospital, who continuing to the last steady in his religious principles, was buried here.

Adjoining to this lazaretto there is a spacious garden which formerly belonged to it, but was sold by the magistrates on the condition, that if any epidemical sickness should happen to prevail in the city, and the ground be wanted for tents, &c. it shall be returned to the lazaretto.

† This plan and the remaining ones referred to in this page, as they could not all be conveniently inserted here, will be found at the end of the book.

‡ My peculiar thanks are justly due to the very worthy magistrates of Genoa, for their kind permission to see their lazarettos, and to copy the plans; and for the regulations which they gave me.

‖ See State of Prisons, third edit. p. 109.

§ I cannot mention the name of Sir Robert Ainslie without expressing the sense I have of my obligations to him for his kind assistance, and the generous offer he made me of residence at his house, when I was at Constantinople.

8 LAZARETTOS Sect. I

[Naples.]

The lazaretto at Naples is very small and I am informed that too little attention is paid there to passengers and shipping, under quarantine. I have therefore only given a view of the helath-office.* See plate IX.

[Malta Quarantine.]

At Malta there are two kinds of quarantine performed: one by ships with clean bills of health, and the other by ships with foul bills. The first, called the petty quarantine, lasts eighteen days, and the ships which perform it lie at the entrance of the port near the health-office. In order to enable the passengers and crews, without producing danger, to buy provisions and converse with their friends, there are enclosures separated by stone posts, with rails and palisades: and two soldiers stationed to prevent any improper communication.

Here, some of the ships from the Morea, and other places, unload their grain. At a little distance there is a church, situated on high ground, and intended for the accommodation of the persons who perform this quarantine. A letter brought by a ship just arrived from Turkey, was I saw, received with a pair of iron tongs, dipped in vinegar, and then put into a case, and laid for about a quarter of an hour on wire grates, under which straw and perfumes had been burnt: after which the case was opened, and the letter taken out by one of the directors of the office. And this is the usual method of receiving letters here.

[Lazaretto.]

The other, called the great quarantine, is performed at a lazaretta which is situated on peninsula near the city. On the most elevated part of this peninsula is Fort Manuel: the lazaretto, being on the shore, is less airy. Additions have been made to it at times The old part is inconvenient and too close to admit of a proper ventilation of cottons and other merchandise. It has sixteen rooms on two floors. On the higher floor there are eight, which open into a balcony and have opposite windows but all were very dirty.

In the other part of this building there are two courts, with rooms and sheds much more convenient for passengers, and airy for merchandise. Both these courts are one hundred and one feet by sixty-three. Two other buildings and a chapel were just begun; and these erections, when finished, will make the lazaretto capable of allowing a proper separation of the cargoes of six or seven ships on quarentine together.

At the end of the lazaretto there is a large court, with stone troughs for beasts, which often come from the Barbary coast. At the upper part of this court, on a pleasant rising ground, there are several large and good sheds, with stone mangers, and two or three rooms over them

There is here a burying ground where there seemed to have been some recent burials; and also a place for burning the bodies of such as die of the plague.

* The lazaretto at Messina is on an island near the city, of which I had a full view at Sea. I did not visit it, because this city is almost depopulated, and its trade destroyed by the late dreadful earthquakes: but being formerly a place of great trade, I was glad of an opportunity by favour of our consul Mr Green, to copy the plan of the lazaretto which I found hung up in the health office at Trieste. See plates X. XI.

[Plates X. XI.]

Sect. I. LAZARETTOS. 9

[Malta.]

The greatest care is taken to destroy infection should there be any. Ships with foul bills are required to perform quarantine eighty days: but at the end of forty days they may change their station, and the captains are allowed to come on shore. The different kinds of goods are separated, and placed in proper order under cover. The cottons are taken out of the bags containing them, and placed in rows of piles, upon boards laid on stone pillars about eighteen inches from the floors; and in repacking they are flung over a man who gets into the bags, in order to tread down the cotton; the consequence of which must be exposing him to great danger should any infection remain. This, though the surest way of expelling infection from cotton, is not the most agreeable to merchants, not only because more expensive, but also for the following reason. The bales of cotton, in conveying them on camels to the sea-ports, are often taken off on the roads, and laid in wet and dirty places where their outsides are injured. In consequence of being taken to pieces and repacked in the lazaretto in the manner now described, the injured parts get among the inner parts, and the cotton acquires the appearance of being wholly damaged; and, therefore, is rendered less marketable. - These are observations which three large English ships performing quarantine while I was here gave me an opportunity of making.

[Zante.]

The health-office at Zante is in the city at the water side. In this office the depositions are taken from the captains they arrive. If they come from the Levant, or from the Barbary coast, they perform forty-two days quarantine; if from the Morea, only twenty-one days; if from any other part, they and the passengers are generally permitted to pass through the office into the city, as I did when I arrived here from Malta. Three gentlemen in this office give daily attendance for one year without salary or emolument.

The old lazaretto* is distant about half a mile from the city, and situated on a rising ground near the sea. The merchandise is brought hither in a large boat belonging to the office, and rowed by the crew of the ship under quarantine; a smaller boat of the office attending at some distance. The entrance is by a covered gate-way ten feet wide, and convenient for the admission of packages. On one side there is a room for the guard consisting of a corporal and four soldiers, on the other, a room for the sub-prior. The prior himself resides in the looms over the gate-way, and is appointed by the directors of the health-office at Venice.

Between the outer and inner-gate one of the guards at night commands the middle court, the gate into it being palisaded. This court is about one hundred and thirty feet long and thirty-five wide. The doors of the other courts (three on each side) open into this. On one side they are chiefly designed for passengers, and in each there are four

* There is another called the new lazaretto, which is appropriated to a numerous body of peasants, who pass over to the Morea to work in harvest time: on their return they perform here a seven days quarantine; and at this time, other persons from the Morea perform only fourteen days quarantine in the old lazaretto.

10 LAZARETTOS. Sect. I.

[Zante.]

rooms, one of which having a fire-place is called the kitchen*. On the other side there are large, deep, open sheds for goods, with a partition wall. In each of these courts there is a well of water.

At the farther end there is a small paved court, a little elevated above the other courts. On one side of it, there is a neat enclosed garden belonging to Roman Catholic friars, who have a convent at a little distance; and on the other side, a chapel in which three of the friars officiate; and also a Greek chapel. - I am the more particular in the description of this lazaretto, as its situation and general plan struck me as affording some good ideas for the construction of a house of correction.

[Corfu.]

[Castel-Novo.]

The lazaretto at Corfu is finely situated on a rock surrounded with water, about a league from the city. The lazaretto of Castel-Novo in Dalmatia is on the shore about two miles from the city. At the back of it there is a delightful hill, which belongs to a convent of friars. Persons in quarantine, after a few days are allowed to walk there, and divert themselves with shooting, &c. But, being in a ship with a foul bill, I could not see either of these lazarettos. Their officers are dependent on the health-office at Venice, and their regulations are similar.

After visiting the lazarettos now described, I sailed to Smyrna, and from thence to Constantinople. Here I had once intended to travel by land to Vienna. This is a journey capable of being easily performed in twenty-four days, no quarantine being now required to be performed at Semlin, the place on the confines of the Emperor's Hungarian dominions, where formerly travellers used to be detained for this purpose. But on farther consideration I determined to seek an opportunity of performing quarantine myself; and with this view to submit to the inconveniences of a sea-voyage to Venice, the place where lazarettos were first established. And, in order to obtain the best information by performing the strictest quarantine, I farther determined to return to Smyrna, and there to take my passage in a ship with a foul bill. Contrary winds and other causes made this a tedious and dangerous voyage, and it was sixty days from the time of leaving Smyrna before I arrived at Venice.

[Venice.]

Here, after our ship had been conducted by a pilot-boat to her proper moorings, a messenger came from the health-office for the captain; and I went with him in his boat to see the manner in which his report was made, his letters delivered, and his examination conducted. The following morning a messenger came in a gondola to conduct me to the new lazaretto. I was placed, with my baggage, in a boat fastened by a cord ten feet long to another boat in which were six rowers. When I came near the landing-place, the cord was loosed, and my boat was pushed with a pole to the shore, where a person met me, who said he had been ordered by the magistrates to be my guard. Soon after

* Here the late Mr. Montague performed his quarantine; after which he resided for some time in the convent of the friars. But there being an earthquake while he was there, he afterwards lived in a tent in the garden of these friars, and would never enter a house on the island.

Sect. I. LAZARETTOS. 11

[Venice.]

unloading the boat, the sub-prior came and shewed me my lodging, which was a very dirty room, full of vermin, and without table, chair, or bed. That day and the next morning I employed a person to wash my room: but this did not remove the offensiveness of it, or prevent that constant head-ach which I had been used to feel in visiting other lazarettos, and some of the hospitals in Turkey. This lazaretto is chiefly assigned to Turks and soldiers, and the crews of those ships which have the plague on board. In one of the enclosures was the crew of a Ragusian ship, which had arrived a few days before me, after being driven from Ancona and Trieste. My guard sent a report of my health to the office, and on the representation of our consul, I was conducted to the old lazaretto which is nearer the city. Having brought a letter to the prior from the Venetian ambassador at Constantinople, I hoped now to have had a comfortable lodging. But I was not so happy. The apartment appointed me (consisting of an upper and a lower room) was no less disagreeable and offensive than the former. I preferred lying in the lower room on a brick floor where I was almost surrounded with water. After six days, however, the prior removed me to an apartment in some respects better, and consisting of four rooms. Here I had a pleasant view; but the rooms were without furniture, very dirty, and no less offensive than the sick wards of the worst hospital. The walls of my chamber, not having been cleaned probably for half a century, were saturated with infection. I got them washed repeatedly with boiling water, to remove the offensive smell, but without any effect. My appetite failed, and I concluded I was in danger of the slow hospital-fever. I proposed white-washing my room with lime slacked in boiling water, but was opposed by strong prejudices. I got, however, this done one morning through the assistance of the British consul, who was so good as to supply me with a quarter of a bushel of fresh lime for the purpose. And the consequence was, that my room was immediately rendered so sweet and fresh, that I was able to drink tea in it in the afternoon, and to lie in it the following night*. On the next day the walls were dry as well as sweet, and in a few days I recovered my appetite. Thus, at a small expense, and to the admiration of the other inhabitants of this lazaretto, I provided for myself and successors, an agreeable and wholesome room, instead of a nasty and contagious one.

Over the gate-ways of two large rooms or warehouses, were carved in stone the images of three faints, (San Sebastiano, San Marco, and San Rocco) reckoned the patrons of this lazaretto. Formerly, when persons who had the plague were brought from the city, they

* This room was lime-whited in November, and in a very rainy season. This I mention, because in the following March on complaining to the under-sheriffs in Newgate of their inattention to the clause which orders this in the Act of Parliament for securing the health of prisoners, their excuse was, that they were afraid of dampness, which seemed to me as reasonable as it would be not to allow towels for those whose feet, hands and face are dirty, lest by waiting them they should catch cold.

[Venice.]

were put into one of these rooms for forty days, and afterwards into the other for the same time, before they were discharged*.

[Rules.]

The Rules and Tariffs of the other lazarettos in Europe having been evidently formed from those established at Venice, I shall be more particular in my account of the regulations here for performing quarantine.

The following account has been, for the most part, copied from the sketch of an information sent to our government in 1770, the perusal of which I owe to the favour of Mr. Richie our consul at Venice. I carefully examined this sketch during my quarantine of forty-two days, and I have here given it with a few corrections and observations.

[Health Office.]

The health-office at Venice was instituted by decree of the senate in the year 1448, in the midst of a very destructive pestilence, and afterwards confirmed and regulated by various subsequent decrees, till reduced to the excellent order in which it stands at present. This important office is governed by three commissioners, annually chosen by the senate, whose duty it is to attend every day to the business of the office; and to them are added two assistant commissioners, and two extraordinary, who have formerly served as junior commissioners, or are gentlemen of wisdom and experience: these last take their seats at the board when they think it requisite, or when cases of difficulty and danger require their counsel. The power or authority of this court is very extensive; for, when all the seven magistrates sit together, their judgments are decisive and without appeal, as well in civil as criminal affairs that relate to public health, all which fall under their cognizance; by which means this court is one of the most respectable in the government, and accordingly is always filled by persons of approved integrity and reputation, and in easy circumstances, in order to be less exposed to corruption, as their emoluments are very small, although it is a step towards more lucrative employments. - I shall not enter into an elaborate description of every particular circumstance relative to this office, only so far as is necessary to form an idea of its regulations and order in the expurgation of merchandise, or passengers coming from places suspected of pestilential infection. I shall therefore first take notice of the office itself, the duty and authority of its magistrates, &c. and afterwards successively give a particular account of the lazarettos, priors of the lazarettos, guardians of health, messengers, porters, the method of receiving captains of ships from suspected parts, taking their reports, quarantine of passengers, and expurgation of goods in the lazaretto; taking notice occasionally of other circumstances of less moment, which have a relation to, or connexion with those above mentioned.

* Many of the windows in these rooms, and also in some other ancient pest-houses which I have seen, are now bricked up. This shews, that in the last century, physicians were sensible of the importance of fresh air, and a free circulation of it in sick wards. A different practice, particularly in the small-pox and the gaol-fever, was afterwards adopted by medical gentlemen; but we seem now to be returning to the ancient and more salutary practice. Formerly also, it seems probable that men did not entertain those absurd prejudices against the free use of water in washing themselves and their rooms, which are now prevalent; for, in several of the old pest-houses, I have observed the marks of a greater attention to the means of gaining plenty of water than has been thought necessary in many of the hospitals built within these fifty years.

Sect. I. LAZARETTOS. 13

[Venice.]

The court is always attended by a secretary, who is a notary public, advocate fiscal, Venice. and several clerks, who are for life or during good behaviour, and have their respective salaries.- The priors of the lazarettos are subjected to this board, as are the guardians of health, and messengers, whose particular duties I shall afterwards describe. It maintains overseers in different parts of the city to inspect the provisions fold in the public markets, shops or otherwise, who make their report of whatever they find that might have a tendency to affect the public health; their business is also to superintend beggars, to prevent loathsome and noxious distempers being derived from want and misery, or other obvious causes; they keep an exact register of deaths, and the bodies of those who die without any previous malady, are accurately examined by the physician and surgeon immediately belonging to the office; both these have a fixed salary, and are consulted by the board in cases relating to their respective professions; they are also obliged in contagious emergencies to shut themselves up in the lazaretto to take care of the sick*.

[Lazarettos.]

The city of Venice has two lazarettos appropriated to the expurgation of merchandise susceptible of infection, coming from suspected parts, and for the accommodation of passengers in performing quarantine; as also for the reception of persons and effects infected in the unhappy times of pestilence. The old lazaretto is two miles, and the new about five miles distant from the city, both on little islands, separated from all communication, not only by broad canals surrounding them, but also by high walls; they are of large extent, being about four hundred geometrical paces in circumference. They have only a ground floor and one over it, and are divided and subdivided into a great number of apartments, greater and smaller, for the reception of passengers; all these apartments have their separate entries and stairs, and every range of them has an open court in front, with plats of grass which is not suffered to grow too high, and no kind of trees or vegetables are permitted within this district, nor within a good distance from it. There are sheds against some of the walls, and in other proper places (but not mixed with the apartments of passengers) so contrived that the merchandise is not exposed to damage by rain or otherwise, and at the same time, that the air is not confined. A more minute description would be tedious, and as the plan of the old lazaretto may be seen (in plate XII.), is not necessary.

[Prior's Duty.]

The internal government and direction of these lazarettos is committed in each to an officer called a Prior, who is chosen by the board of health, and accountable to it alone for his management; he has an assistant chosen by himself, and confirmed by the magistrates; both these have a competent salary, and are obliged to reside in the lazaretto, where a convenient habitation is assigned them.- The priorship is an office of great trust, and the magistrates

* Besides the health-office at Venice, every city or town of any note or commerce has one of its own, upon the same plan as that of the metropolis, directed by gentlemen of the place not concerned in trade, who serve gratis and think it an honour to watch over the health of their fellow-citizens; the necessary ministers and clerks are paid by the respective communities; and all these courts of health are dependent on that of Venice, and accountable to it in every respect. See Zante.

14 LAZARETTOS. Sect. I.

[Venice.]

are careful to confer it upon none but such as are suitably qualified; he must not be related to any in the magistracy, nor to any of its ministers; must have no interest or concern in shipping, nor in trade; and in the exercise of his office he is subjected to the strictest rules, the most material of which are as follow.

[Rules.]

He must see all the gates and doors of the different apartments locked every evening by sun-set, as well the outward gates as those of the apartments occupied by passengers, merchandise, and porters; he takes the keys into his possession, and suffers them not to be opened before sun-rise. And where there is any suspicion of infection, the gates must be kept constantly locked, and opened only for necessary occurrences, in the presence of the prior.

[Prior's Duty.]

He must not suffer dogs, cats or other domestic animals to go loose in the lazaretto.

He must neither buy nor sell, nor make bargains or contracts with passengers or others within the lazaretto, nor permit others to do so; neither are contracts of any kind, purchases or sales, nor even powers of attorney or other notorial acts allowed there, without express leave from the board; otherwise they are null and void.

He suffers no fishing boats, nor other small craft to come within a certain distance of the lazaretto, nor any communication between those in quarantine, and such boats.

He keeps a book wherein are regularly noted all persons who perform quarantine, together with a general inventory of their effects, and a particular distinct one of all goods and merchandise, copies of which he transmits to the health-office, at least once a month.

He cannot receive persons nor effects to perform quarantine without a mandates from the office, which mandate must be always accompanied by a messenger, and in the same form at their discharge. Neither can he admit visitors to those in quarantine without such a mandate, which (for visits) is given gratis from the office*. But public brokers are excluded from these visits, even if they had obtained a mandate for that purpose.

He is to take care that quiet and good order be maintained among the passengers and porters, and must not permit gaming, drinking, nor even such exercises and diversions as might produce a mixture of persons in different quarantines, or offend the circumspection of the place.

When a passenger or porter falls sick, the prior by means of the respective guardian takes care that he is separated from others in the same apartment as much as possible, and immediately gives notice to the board, who send their physician to examine diligently the nature of the disease, and any other physician may be called jointly with him; but they are not to transgress the cautions prescribed, or they would be detained in the same apartment, till the quarantine ended. The prior is authorized to execute the office of notary public in cases of necessity, for no notary is admitted without express order from the board; he therefore may draw up wills and testaments of those within his territory, but it must be done in the presence of five witnesses. When any person dies there, unless the physician of the

Sect. I. LAZARETTOS. 15

[Venice]

office, together with the surgeon declare that his death proceeded not from any contagious cause, and that they are quite clear and explicit in their report, all those in his quarantine must begin it anew, and that as often as any suspected death happens in it. There is a burial place within the lazaretto, and the dead are all buried naked, by those of their respective apartments, and if there is any suspicion of infection, a quantity of quick-lime is thrown upon the corpse in the grave, which is digged five or six feet deep.

[Prior's Duty.]

It is the prior's duty to see that the guardians of the respective quarantines cause the passengers to expose their apparel, and other effects to the open air every day, and that they give all proper assistance to those under their guard.

He ought to visit every apartment under quarantine at least twice a day, once in the morning, and once after noon, to see that the passengers are properly served and supplied with necessaries, and that every thing goes on according to the rules and cautions of health. He is to take into his possession all sorts of arms belonging to passengers, which are to be restored when the quarantine is finished.

[Sutlers.]

No sutlers are admitted, but those appointed by the board, on purpose to supply the lazaretto with provisions and other necessaries; these are obliged to come every day, and to bring whatever the passengers order, at a fixed price; extortion is severely punished; they are not to enter the lazaretto, but have a convenient place assigned them, where the guardians and passengers can come to see their provisions, and to give their orders; the sutlers have baskets fastened to poles of seven or eight feet long, in which they reach every thing to those within, and in presence of the prior or his substitute, who cause the money to be dipped in vinegar or salt water, before the sutlers take it. These sutlers are subjected to the magistracy, and liable to punishment for every contravention of its rules and orders, which are hung up*.

[Prior's Duty.]

When letters are written from the lazaretto they must be fumigated in the usual way by the guardian who superintends the apartment, then reached to the prior by means of a cane, or other stick split in the end for that purpose, and by him sometimes perfumed and sent away. He causes the porters employed in expurgation of goods, to sweep and keep clean their respective sheds, and all around them, suffering no bits of wool, cotton, or such like to fly about, or to lie on the ground when there is any passage; and attends with the most vigilant exactness to the porters in the discharge of their daily duty, as will be more fully explained under another head.

The prior cannot be arrested, during his office, by any other magistrate but those of health, nor is subject to civil or criminal prosecution in any other court of justice: neither can persons or effects be arrested or attached in the lazaretto during quarantine. The prior is strictly enjoined not to exact money, or any other consideration whatever from the passengers, by way of recompense for his trouble or attendance, nor ought he even,

* Every morning two sutlers came in their boats with provisions, wood, &c. to the old lazaretto. The price of bread, butter, milk, fruit, and fuel, which I purchased, was about one third more than the price in the city.

16 LAZARETTOS, Sect. I.

[Venice.]

(according to the laws) to accept of presents from passengers who perform quarantine, or from merchants whose goods are under his inspection; only he is entitled to a small recognition for every bale or parcel, as regulated by the magistrates. But he and his assistants expect a gratuity*.

[Prior's Duty.]

The prior and his substitute must carefully avoid touching either goods or passengers in quarantine, and for that end, in their walks and visits always carry a cane to keep passengers at a proper distance; but if by an unfortunate accident they should be contaminated by touch, they must perform the quarantine from whence the suspicion of infection was derived, and others would be appointed in their room, pro tempore. If they were touched by malicious design, the person offending is liable to such punishment as the nature of the offence requires, and the magistrates of health judge adequate.

Neither the prior nor his substitute must leave the lazaretto, except when called by the magistrates, or upon business with them relative to his office; and not without express permission, on his private affairs†.

[Guardians.]

There are sixty guardians belonging to the health-office of Venice, of whom part are appointed to inspect the quarantines of passengers, merchandise, and the porters attending it in the lazaretto, and part superintend the quarantines of ships and their companies, on board which they are sent immediately on their arrival, and continue till their discharge; all these have a fixed daily allowance, from the passengers, masters of ships or merchants in whose service they immediately are. Their duty in the lazaretto is to attend on passengers, to assist them in their accommodation and otherwise, and strictly to observe that no mixture of different quarantines happens; as every apartment of passengers by the same ship, or if goods and porters have their respective guardian, none of them are permitted to go without the limits of their allotted apartment, unless accompanied by the guardian, who has his cane to keep others at a due distance. On the arrival of passengers he must see all their trunks, chests, &c. opened, put his hands in every one of them, take a note of the general contents, and if he finds any thing contraband, the prior must acquaint the magistracy, who determine accordingly. They are to be very watchful about the health of their passengers, and give notice to the prior whenever they perceive symptoms of sickness. They must keep the strictest eye over the porters, that they neglect not their daily labour in airing and moving the goods under their care, and in case of negligence, want of punctuality or dishonesty, they inform the prior who complains to the magistrates, and the porters are punished. The guardians

* To the prior I gave six sequins, to the sub-prior three, and to the guardian one, which was thought proper by those whom I consulted. (A sequin is about nine shillings.)

† On desiring the prior to shew me the rules for the officers of the lazaretto, he presented me with a printed copy, entitled Commissioni in via d'istruzione, al nuovamente eletio Priere del lazaretto.

In Venezia 1726, quarto, 48 pages.

Sect. I. LAZARETTOS. 17

[Venice.]

also are under the eye of the prior, and in cases of collusion or wilful neglect, they are punished severely and sometimes capitally*.

[ Guardians.]

The duty of guardians on board ships is still more strict, and requires greater attention; for, not having the prior to direct them in any emergency, as in the lazaretto, they must correspond directly with the office, and give an account of every thing that happens immediately. On their going aboard, they must take an exact roll of all the ship's crew, which they transmit to the office, and they must see them all mustered every day, that no sickness be concealed, nor elopement made. They must also take a distinct and minute note of all goods and effects on board without exception, a copy of which they also transmit to the office, in order to prevent contraband goods being clandestinely retained.

After this they must on no consideration allow any thing to go out of the ship, nor must they suffer any bark or other vessel to come near without a mandate; and when visits are permitted to the captain or crew, the guardian must always be in sight of the interview, that the due cautions of health be carefully observed. They are to take care that the sutlers appointed to serve ships in quarantine, perform their duty faithfully, and with due regard to the rules of health, in like manner as in the lazaretto. They are to permit no passengers to perform quarantine on board the ship, under any pretence whatever; and if any should remain on board in sailors' disguise, he or they must be sent to the lazaretto, and the ship begins her quarantine anew from the day after their departure; which happens in the same manner if goods should be concealed on board, after the rest of the cargo is sent to the lazaretto.

[Messengers.]

Messengers or servants are employed by the magistrates of the health-office to conduct all captains of ships to the office, to make their report, and back again on board, the captains going in their own boat, and the messengers in theirs; they must also attend all passengers to the lazaretto, as well as every lighter of merchandise sent thither, and see the boat's crew return on board again, without communication with others. They are obliged also (or rather the eldest of them) to receive, open, and perfume, or smoke, all letters that come by ships from suspected parts; and all captains, sailors or passengers, are strictly prohibited from keeping letters on board, or sending them ashore without this requisite formality at the health-office: they are afterwards sealed again, and distributed according to their directions. These messengers or servants (in number seven) are also employed in general, on all messages from the office, whether to the lazaretto, or vessels in quarantine, or on business relating to the department of health in the city. They have no fixed salary, but are paid so much for conducting captains of ships, passengers†, or merchandise.

* Several of these guardians are old and infirm, and of no use in waiting on passengers. The daily pay of each is three lira and a half, as engraved on a stone in the lazaretto. But my guardian was very cross till I made him an extra-allowance of a sequin a week for provisions.

† Being first sent to the new lazaretto, and afterwards conducted to the old, the demand by the messenger on the day I came out was sixty lires and a half. Finding that he expected a gratuity, I gave him a sequin over and above his demand.

18 LAZARETTOS. Sect. I.

[Venice Porters.]

All porters employed in purging goods in the lazaretto, are immediately under the inspection and jurisdiction of the magistrates of health, so long as they remain there, being superintended by the prior and guardians, and if found deficient in doing their duty, are punished according to the rigour of the law, as indeed all other delinquents are in matters of health. Every merchant must have his own porters; but their names must be given into the office, and approbation obtained; neither is it permitted to agree with them by the lump, but they must have their settled daily wages; the number of porters must also be proportioned to the number of bales or large parcels, and for every forty bales or large parcels, there must be a porter.

Of receiving Captains of Ships from suspected Parts, and taking their Report.

It is here proper to premise, that all ships are received at Venice, even those which are known to have the plague on board; the rules of health are very exactly attended to in every circumstance; in this they are naturally somewhat more strict, but for the rest do not deviate from the established course. It is also requisite to observe, that all ships and merchandise coming from any part of the Ottoman dominions, are indispensably subjected to the full quarantine of forty days; for, as the Turks take no precautions to prevent this dreadful calamity, or to preserve or deliver themselves from it; the Venetians very justly conclude that it is precarious and highly dangerous to trust to any certificates of health whatever, whether from their own consuls or others, in places where, although the contagion do not openly appear, it may be lurking in bales of merchandise transported from other parts. Besides, ships from Zante, Cephalonia, and the other Venetian islands are always liable to a quarantine of thirty days, or three weeks at least, and frequently to forty days; because, lying so near the Morea, and having daily communication with its inhabitants, they often neglect the strict rules of health, or connive at the breach of them, though all of them have an office; on which communication they principally depend for their subsistence, the produce of these islands not being sufficient for a third part of their inhabitants. To prevent therefore the fatal consequences that such negligence might produce, it is an established rule, to treat all ships and merchandise on their arrival at Venice from these suspected places, with the same caution and reserve, as if they were actually infected; and to obviate all danger before their arrival, the pilots are strictly charged, on capital penalty, not to go on board any ship from Turkey, or the adjacent islands, nor to mix with the people; nay, even no pilot is permitted to go on board any ship whatever till cleared at the health-office, or if necessity requires it, they are not to return to their own boats, but to remain on board, till the ship is declared free at the health-office; and in case of performing quarantine, the pilot must do the same. They are also strictly ordered to use none but tarred ropes, and if the ship they attend comes from suspected parts, they are to put the captain in mind to hoist the usual signal of such ships, that no other boats or vessels may inadvertently hold intercourse with them. When therefore the ship enters the port, or as soon as the above-mentioned signal is discovered, (and the health-office keeps a person on purpose to give notice of the approach of these and all other ships) a guardian is dispatched on board, whose office and duty commences

Sect. I. LAZARETTOS. 19

[Venice.]

from that moment, and continues till the ship has performed quarantine: besides, in dangerous cases, as soon as the ship comes to anchor in the situation appointed, a bark with a party of soldiers is sent to lie at a proper distance, and to observe that nothing is done against the established laws. Then one of the messengers goes to conduct the captain to the health-office; his boat keeps a proper distance before that of the captain, clears the way, and takes care that no communication is held between those in the suspected boat and others. When they arrive at the landing place of the office, which is so contrived that the captain and people may talk with those on shore without approaching too near, he is forthwith conducted into an enclosed entry for that purpose, adjoining to the office, where his report is taken by a clerk, from a window at due distance;

[Questions to Captains.]

the usual questions are asked, such as, from whence he comes; when he left his port; whether he has a clean bill of health or not; what kind of voyage he has made; if he touched intermediate ports; if he had product in them, or not; if he met vessels at sea; and of what nation; if he were aboard of them, or they of him; how many hands he has on board, and if any passengers if they have been all the voyage in health, or if any be dead, or sick; what his loading consists of; if he took it in all in one port: this report is written down by the clerk, and then all his papers and letters are demanded. The first papers to be examined (after previous fumigation) is the bill of health, which is compared with the report given in by the captain, both in regard to the health of the place from whence he came, and to the number of seamen and passengers on hoards and if any captain present himself without a bill of health, it is the unalterable rule of the office, to oblige ship and cargo to perform full quarantine. If there should be any difference between the bills of health, and the captain's report, in the number of persons on board, it is very strictly examined into, and the ship although coming from a place without the least suspicion of infection, is kept in reserve till the matter is sufficiently cleared up; and if any malicious intention be discovered in the captain to deceive the magistracy, by giving false reports, it is a capital crime, and punished accordingly; for if the number on board be greater than that in the bills of health, there is ground to suspect that the supernumerary person or persons have been taken from on board another ship, or from some place, without die requisite documents of health: and if the number be less, it might have been diminished by some contagious disease; but supposing these points satisfactory, all ships with clean bills of health are at liberty to unload directly after the captain's report, and he may return on board, without the messenger. But when the ship is from any part of the Turkish dominions, or other suspected parts, the captain is re-conducted on board with the same formality as he came. The guardian being already on board, begins immediately on the captain's return to exercise his office, by taking an exact roll of all the crew, and a particular note of their clothes and other effects, both which he transmits to the office, to be compared with the captain's report; and when permission is given to unload, he keeps an exact register of every parcel that goes out of the ship, which he transmits to the office, in order to be compared with the captain's manifesto delivered in writing on making his report.

20 LAZARETTOS. Sect. I

Quarantine of Passengers.

[Venice.]

When there are passengers on board, as soon as the above formalities are over, a mandate is sent from the office, to remove them to the lazaretto, where they usually go in the ship's boat, the messenger always keeping near them in his; when they arrive at the lazaretto, the messenger consigns them to the prior, and conducts the ship's boat back again. The passengers find their guardian of health at the lazaretto before them; their apartment is assigned, their clothes and other effects for use are visited, and noted; and they begin to count their quarantine from the day after their arrival at the lazaretto, with the precautions and regulations already described.

Unloading Merchandise, and removing it to the Lazaretto.

All goods and effects susceptible of infection from suspected parts, must go to the lazaretto to perform quarantine, none being permitted to remain in the ship; but such as are not susceptible, and in bulk may be unloaded on the ship's arrival, after obtaining a mandate, and in presence of a messenger, who must be always within sight, as well as the ship's guardian on board. Great caution is used in transporting merchandise to the lazaretto; the lighters must have no sails, or the prior detains them along with the goods; the ropes are well tarred; the sailors belonging to the ship load them, and take them in tow with their own boats to the lazaretto, always accompanied by a messenger in going and coming. The prior receives them, as before observed, delivers them to the care of the porters and guardians, and they are accountable. One of the ship-mates or seamen remains in the lazaretto for further guard to the goods, and to be answerable for the bills of lading, performing his quarantine there. When the whole cargo is unloaded, and properly disposed and ranged in the lazaretto, the quarantine of both ship and goods commences, and not before.

Expurgation of Goods in the Lazaretto.

Goods for expurgation are ranged under sheds for that purpose in the lazaretto, in different order, according to the kinds and marks of the parcels, so that no confusion insues in distinguishing the respective properties.

[Wool.]

Wool is taken entirely out of the bags or bales, and ranged in heaps, not above four feet high, these are all moved twice every day, turned, and the heaps mixed by the porters with their hands and arms bare, during forty days successively, and every five days are besides the usual labour, moved out of the places they were in.

[Silk.]

Silk, flax, feathers, and such like, are managed in the same manner.

[Cotton Wool.]

Cotton wool and yarn, camel's hair and beaver in bags, are purged in a different way. The bags are all unripped at one end, and the porters are obliged every day, to thrust their naked hands and arms into them, in different places, as far as the middle of the bag, for twenty days successively; then the bags are sewed up, turned over, and the other end unripped, and managed in the same manner the twenty subsequent days, which complete the quarantine; but neither of the days wherein the bags are opened, are reckoned among the forty.

Sect. I. LAZARETTOS. 21

[Venice.]

[Woollen Cloth.]

Woollen and linen cloths, and all goods that are folded in pieces, are unloosed, and the porters turn them over fold by fold, thrusting their naked arms between the folds, and shifting them often, under and above. When there is a certainty of infection, besides this daily motion, they are unfolded, and extended on cords to the open air, as often as the weather permits. Carpets, blankets, bed covers, quilts, and other manufactures of wool and silk, flax, books, vellum, and all kinds of paper, hair bags, and such like, are continually exposed to the air, moved and turned two or three times a day.

[Furs.]

Furs are among the most dangerous articles, and very carefully purged, kept constantly exposed to the air, and very often moved and shaken; in like manner hair, and ostrich feathers are very diligently attended to.

[Tobacco.]

Tobacco, cordouans, sheep and goats skins, dressed, and all other dry dressed skins, are ranged in heaps, and now and then moved; but being articles less subject to infection they are usually liberated in twenty days.

[Bees Wax.]

Bees wax and sponges, are purged by putting them in salt water (not stagnated) for forty-eight hours, and then they are free. There is a place formed in the lazaretto for this purpose, and a guardian to superintend the operation.

[Candles.]

Wax and tallow candles are subject to full quarantine, on account of the cotton in them, but if the proprietor submits to let them be immerged as above, they are free.

[Animals.]

Animals with wool or long hair, are liable to the whole quarantine; but those with short straight hair are purged by causing them to swim ashore. The feathered animals are purged by repeated sprinkling with vinegar till well wet.

[Hides.]

There are other articles not susceptible of infection, and of consequence not liable to quarantine, though sometimes they become liable by attendant circumstances, such as salted hides, which when sufficiently salted and moist, are free; but if dry, they must undergo the formalities of quarantine.

[Aspher.]

Aspher is in itself free, and may be landed, but its being wrapt or packed up in susceptible matter, subjects it to quarantine; and in like manner, other free articles which cannot be separated from their package, or if the proprietors do not choose they should be, are liable to the cautions of the lazaretto.

[Articles Free.]

Many articles are always free, when they come in the lump, and others though in package, either because the package itself is free, or purified by the volatile qualities of the contents, or can be removed or rendered harmless. Of the first sort, are all kinds of grain, Vallonia or bark, salt, flax seed, and in general all seeds, marble, minerals, wood, earths, sand, allum, vitriol, elephants' teeth, &c. Of the second sort are sugars, cheese, butter, pignoli, fruits fresh and dried, all salted and smoked meat, &c. Bottorghi, drugs, colours, and such like, that can be separated from the packages. Of the third sort, are liquors of all kinds, brandies, oils, wines, after pitching the bungs, lest there should be canvass or any thing of that nature in them, currants, raisins and pitch, although in canvass packages, are free, because it is supposed their nature, or the effluvia proceeding from them prevent contagion, only the seams and corners are tarred.

22 LAZARETTOS. Sect. I.

[Venice.]

The Venetians were formerly one of the first commercial nations in Europe, and the regulations for performing quarantine in their lazarettos are wise and good; but now, in almost every department into which I had opportunity to look, there is such remissness and corruption in executing these regulations, as to render the quarantine almost useless, and little more than an establishment for providing for officers and infirm people.

[Modon.]

In coming from Smyrna in a Venetian ship with a foul bill, we first anchored at Modon in the Morea, for water. Here a Turkish officer came on board, and attended us till we were out of the port, to see that this alone was our object*.

[Zante.]

Afterwards we anchored at Zante, where some passengers disembarked, and we were detained a day or two extraordinary, that the captain might retail coffee, &c. to the inhabitants. We next anchored at an island north of Corfu, where the captain and passengers went ashore, and the inhabitants came on board to traffic for quilts, &c.

[Castel-Novo.]

Opposite Castel-Novo, at about two miles distance is the health-office, where all ships that come from the Levant into that port are obliged to anchor. Here the owner of the ship lived; and the captain and passengers went almost every day into the city; and employing themselves in unloading and loading goods day and night, caused a delay of eight days. The mate openly in the day time took goods to his friends in the country, and continued with them till the next day. A Ragusian ship also, and others which anchored here with clean bills, freely associated and traded with us. I observed that a half naked man (a soldier) came to us in a boat rowed by a boy, twice a day, and that he received biscuits and hot victuals. I imagined that he came for charity; but soon learnt that he was the guard for our ship, appointed by the officer who resided at the health-office.

[Molita.]

At the isle of Molita, near the coast of Dalmatia we anchored again, and the captain and two of the passengers went directly ashore. Three days were spent here in trading with the inhabitants, and the opportunity of a fine wind was lost, to gratify the avarice of the captain.

Such occurrences convinced me of the justness of a remark, which was made by a Greek merchant who had considerable property on board this ship; that all captains and crews of Levant ships should be strictly prohibited from trading in their voyages. In consequence of this practice, the goods are often detained so long as to lose a market; and the passengers and crews are exposed to more danger, should there be any infection in the ship. But above all; it exposes the inhabitants of the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean to perpetual danger of the importation of the plague. This was dreadfully verified in Dalmatia a few years ago; and I was informed that lately, in a hamlet belonging to the Ragusian state, all the inhabitants died of the plague thus imported, except two or three, who were themselves shot, by the order of the magistrates to the surrounding guard.

* A few days after leaving Modon, we had a smart skirmish with a Tunisian privateer. In this skirmish one of our cannon charged with spike-nails, &c. having accidentally done great execution, the privateer immediately, to our great joy, hoisted its sails and made off. This interposition of Providence saved us from a dreadful fate; for I understood afterwards, that our captain, expecting that either our immediate death, or perpetual slavery at Tunis would be the consequence of being taken, had determined to blow up the ship rather than surrender.

Sect. II. LAZARETTOS. 23

[Trieste.]

At Trieste there are two lazarettos; one new, but both clean, and a contract to those I had lately seen at Venice. The plan of the new one I give in plate XIII. The floors above were boarded, those below were of white bricks; the rooms were eighteen feet and a half by fifteen, had a neat bedstead, chair and table. It is surrounded at the distance of about twenty yards by a double wall, within which are separate burying places for Roman-Catholics, Greeks and Protestants. There is a current of water from the adjacent hills, which, were it properly conducted within the walls, might be very useful.

I am under peculiar obligations to the Director of the health-office for the rules and tariffs of this lazaretto (printed in German and Italian at Trieste, 1769) and for permission to copy its plan; and also the plans of the lazarettos at Marseilles and Venice, which I happened to discover here.

SECTION II.

PROPOSED REGULATIONS

AND

A NEW PLAN FOR A LAZARETTO.

HAVING now given the plans of the principal lazarettos in Europe, I shall in what follows take the same liberty that I took with respect to prisons, and draw the outlines of a proper lazaretto*. - Many lazarettos are close, and have too much the aspect of prisons; and I have often heard captains in the Levant trade say, that the spirits of their passengers sink at the prospect of being confined in them. In those of them which I have visited, I have observed several pale and dejected persons, and many fresh graves. To prevent as much as possible these disagreeable circumstances, a lazaretto should have the most cheerful aspect. A spacious and pleasant garden in particular, would be convenient as well as salutary. See plate XIV.

But waving this observation, I will offer a few remarks respecting quarantines and lazarettos in general; after which I will take notice of some advantages in respect of commerce as well as health, which may accrue from such an establishment in England. I will farther, in

the sequel, give the answers of some physicians abroad to a set of questions which I was led to propose to them, by considering that should a lazaretto be erected among us, and this country be ever visited with a scourge so dreadful as the plague, the opinions of eminent physicians experienced in this calamity might be of particular service.

OBSERVATIONS upon QUARANTINES and LAZARETTOS.

I. All vessels subject to a quarantine, arriving on our coast, should be obliged to hoist a red flag, or some other signal, at the main top-gallant mast head; in order to warn all

* By the Act, 12th of Geo. III. cap. 57. certain persons were empowered to build a lazaretto. And the Act recites "that in the fifth year of the reign of his present Majesty, a sum was granted by Parliament, not exceeding five thousand pounds, towards building a lazaret." But nothing has been done in consequence of this Act.

24 LAZARETTOS. Sect. II.

other ships against all communication with them; and all persons coming on board notwithstanding such warning, should be detained to perform the quarantine.

2. All boats belonging to any ship in quarantine, as well as all craft employed in unloading the same, should be obliged to carry a red pendant at the mast head, whenever sent from the ship.

3. The ship's hatch-ways ought not to be opened till the captain and mate have given in their depositions; and all the passengers, the secretary, and such of the sailors who may be permitted to leave the ship, should be landed at the lazaretto, under a very severe penalty.

4. The place appointed for receiving depositions should be so contrived, that the person who takes them may at all times place himself to windward of those who make them. This should also be observed as much as possible, at the barrier of the lazaretto, where people are permitted to speak with those in quarantine. But if not, they should be placed on this account at a greater distance from one another.

5. A sort of quarantine having been performed during the long voyage to England, and there being, in my opinion, a great probability that the infection cannot remain in any person without shewing itself, beyond forty-eight hours; the persons under quarantine ought to be allowed to quit the lazaretto sooner than is now customary in other countries. Perhaps a residence of twenty-two days may be fully sufficient.

6. Fumigating of passengers as practised at Marseilles is an advantage; for a person may carry the infection in his clothes, and communicate it to others, without taking it himself, as in the gaol-fever. But this implies, that it ought to be done at the end of the quarantine, to those only who go out with the clothes which they wore when they came in.

7. Great care should be taken, to keep at a proper distance from persons performing quarantine, all sailors and passengers as well as others. My reason for giving this caution is, that I have seen persons just arrived in ships with foul bills, permitted at the bar of a lazaretto, to come very near to persons whose quarantine was almost over; and thus danger was produced of communicating the plague. - And here I shall take occasion to observe, that in my opinion, this distemper is not generally to be taken by the touch, any more than the gaol-fever, or small-pox; but either by inoculation, or by taking in with the breath

in respiration the putrid effluvia which hover round the infected object, and which when admitted set the whole mass of blood into a fermentation, and sometimes so suddenly and violently as to destroy its whole texture, and to produce putrefaction and death in less than forty-eight hours. These effluvia are capable of being carried from one place to another, upon any substance where what is called scent can lodge, as upon wool, cotton, &c, and in the same manner that the smell of tobacco is carried from one place to another*.

* I am here reminded of a singular fact, which I gladly mention in honour to the memory of a worthy character. When the plague raged in London, in the year 1665, the infection was conveyed by means of a parcel of clothes to the remote village of Eyam, near Tideswell, in the Peak of Derbyshire. In this place it broke out in September 1665, and continued its ravages upwards of a year, when two hundred and sixty of the inhabitants had died of it. The worthy rector, Mr. Mompesson, whose name may rank with those of cardinal Borromeo of Milan, and

Sect. II. LAZARETTOS. 25

It is by these ideas of the communication of the plague that the foregoing rules have been suggested; and were the regulations for performing quarantine directed by them, some of the restrictions in lazarettos would be abolished, and more care would be taken to improve and enforce others.*

It may be asked, how is it possible, if the plague be communicated by infected air, that a whole body of men in a town where it rages should be capable of being preserved from it, as is the case with Englishmen in Turkey; and also, why every individual in such a town is not taken with it? In answer to the first of these questions, it may be observed, that the infection in the air does not extend far from the infected object, but lurks chiefly, (like that near carrion) to the leeward of it. I am so assured of this, that I have not scrupled going, in the open air, to windward of a person ill of the plague and feeling his pulse.

The next question may be answered, by asking why, of a number of persons equally exposed to the infection of the small-pox, or of the gaol-fever, some will not take it? Perhaps physicians themselves are not capable of explaining this sufficiently. It is, however, evident in general, that it must be owing to something in the state of the blood and the constitutions of such persons which renders them not easily susceptible of infection. - The rich are less liable to the plague than the poor, both because they are more careful to avoid infection, and have larger and more airy apartments, and because they are more cleanly and live on better food, with plenty of vegetables and this, I suppose, is the reason why Protestants are less liable to this distemper than Catholics during their times of fasting; and, likewise, why the generality of Europeans are less liable to it than Greeks, and particularly Jews,† And would not the former be still more secure in this respect, were they more attentive to the qualities of their food, and lived more on plain and simple diet?

the good bishop of Marseilles, at its breaking out, resolved not to quit his parishioners, but used every argument to prevail with his wife to leave the infected spot. She, however, refused to forsake her husband, and is supposed to have died of the plague. They sent away their children. Mr. Mompesson constantly employed himself during the dreadful visitation, in his pastoral office, and preached to his flock in a field where nature had formed a sort of alcove in a rock, which place still retains the appellation of a church. He survived, and the entries in the parish register relative to this calamity are in his hand-writing, viz, 1665, in Sept. 6 died; Oct. 22; Nov. 5; Dec. 7. 1666, in Jan. 3 died; Feb. 5; March 2; April 13; May 5; June 20; July 53; Aug. 78; Sept. 24; Oct. 17; Nov. 1. In the fields surrounding the town are many remains denoting the places where tents were pitched; and tombs are still existing of large families entirely swept away by this devouring pestilence.

* It is remarkable, that when the corpse is cold of a person dead of the plague, it does not infect the air by any noxious exhalations. This is so much believed in Turkey, that the people there are not afraid to handle such corpses. The governor at the French hospital in Smyrna told me, that in the last dreadful plague there, his house was rendered almost intolerable by an offensive scent (especially if he opened any of those windows which looked towards the great burying-ground, where numbers every day were left unburied); but that it had no effect on the health either of himself or his family. An opulent merchant in this city likewise told me, that he and his family had felt the same inconvenience, without any bad consequences.

† The poorer sort of Greeks and Jews use much oil with their food; and this I reckon a disadvantage to them. I have heard of instances of servants in European families, who through imprudence and carelessness, have been attacked with the plague, while the rest of the family have escaped it.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE IMPORTANCE

OF A

LAZARETTO IN ENGLAND.

Having been led by the similarity of the subject to extend my views from prisons and hospitals to Lazarettos, my chief intention in my last tour was to collect the regulations and plans of the lazarettos in Europe. On finding three English ships performing a long and tedious quarantine at Malta, it occurred to me, that a lazaretto in England might save time and expense, and for this reason prove an advantage to our commerce. I therefore consulted on this subject our consuls at Zante and Smyrna, Chancellor Boddington, and several intelligent and respectable merchants; and requested they would give me their opinions. The result was their unanimous recommendation of such a design. From the merchants I received the following letter at Constantinople, of which they have given me leave to make what use I please.

"SIR,

[Smyrna.]

[Merchants' Letter.]

WE flatter ourselves that no apology is necessary for troubling you with this address, calculated to convey to you every information we are masters of, which we think may be of use to you in the attainment of the laudable end you have in view, to forward the interests of society in general, and those of the nation in particular.

We understand that when the building of a lazaretto was agitated in England some time ago, the chief objection to it was the great expense it would be to the nation, which did not reap any adequate advantages by the Turkey trade. We are are as much persuaded that the want of a lazaretto in England has been the cause of the Turkey trade not being, till now, more worth the notice of government, as that the establishment of one will render it an object of great importance to the nation. It will not only be productive of the immediate advantages which flow from an extensive and flourishing trade, but will free the kingdom from the risk it now runs of the plague being introduced into it. That a lazaretto will be productive of these two ends, we hope to prove to your satisfaction by what we are now going to Jay before you.

It is enacted by Act of Parliament, that when any vessel loads for England, in any of the ports of Turkey, and departs with a foul bill of health, such vessels shall perform quarantine at Malta, Leghorn or Venice:* the numberless hardships which this subjects

* "And be it farther enacted - That no goods or merchandizes liable to retain the infection of the plague, and coming from the Levant, without a clean bill of health, shall be landed in any part of Great Britain or Ireland - unless it shall appear - that the said goods - have been sufficiently opened and aired in the lazarets of Malta, Ancona, Venice, Messina, Leghorn, Genoa, and Marseilles, or one of them." 26th Geo. II. p. 300.

Sect. II. LAZARETTOS. 27

[Smyrna.]

[Merchants' Letter.]

our export trade to, amount almost to a total suppression of it. A single accident of the plague in this large city and its environs, or one brought from any other infected place, though this city may be entirely free from it, obliges the consul to issue foul bills of health. As no information, to be depended upon, can be procured from the Turks concerning the plague, and as the Greek nation is the next most numerous one in the city, the consuls apply to the deputies of it for information, when there are any reports of the plague, and according to the answer they receive, they either issue clean or foul bills of health. It often happens that the Greeks themselves are authors of false reports concerning the plague, and that their deputies inform the consuls of accidents having happened in their nation, when in reality there is no plague in the city or its environs. The motive which induces them to give this false information is obvious. The Greeks carry on three-fourths of the Dutch as well as Italian trade: it is therefore their interest (and unfortunately that of every other nation) to depress ours as much as possible; and there is not a more effectual method of doing this, than by obliging our vessels to go to perform a long and expensive quarantine in the ports of the Mediterranean, by which means the cottons which form their principal loading, as well as the chief article of both trades are no less than seven months on their way to London. This long interval gives the Greeks time to load their ships, and as they perform a very short quarantine in Holland (of the nature of which we shall speak more particularly hereafter) they supply our markets by copious exportations of the cottons that were loaded here at the same time with ours, two or three months before our vessels can reach England. It is by this means that more than half the Turkey cottons consumed in England, are supplied by the Dutch to the great support of their Turkey trade, and the ruin of ours; and it is by this means that, whilst our trade is sacrificed by rigorous quarantine laws, to considerations of national safety, the plague may be introduced into the kingdom by the Dutch. To prove that this risk actually exists, and in no small degree, we need only inform you of the method in which Dutch vessels, loaded here in the height of the plague, perform quarantine in Holland. On their arrival at Helvoetfluys a doctor is sent on board of them to visit the crew, which he does by feeling their pulse; after which he immediately returns to the shore, and reports the state of their healths: three or four days after this, the vessel is ordered to a place at a distance from the rest of the shipping, and two or three lighters are sent along side, into which are only emptied the cottons that are in the 'tween decks, and the hatches are opened on pretence of airing the goods in the hold, which form the principal part of the cargo, and which remain untouched till the forty days are over; when they are unloaded into the merchants warehouses, or into the vessels destined to transport them to England. Thus you see, Sir, that one part of the goods perform a slovenly quarantine, and the rest may be said to perform none at all; for, as the air cannot penetrate into holds so closely flowed with cottons as they always are, the forty days they remain in the vessel after her arrival can only be considered as forty days added to her passage. In this manner cottons are brought into England that have undergone no purification

28 LAZARETTOS. Sect. II.

[Smyrna.]

[Merchants' Letter.]

at all; and if it should happen that they are infected, nothing is more easy than the infection's being introduced into England by their means. English vessels can only begin to load here direct for England, forty days after the last accident of the plague, and if any accident happen whilst they are in loading, they must either go away immediately with the few goods they may have on board, or else they must wait in port, on a cruel uncertainty, forty days after the last reported accident, whether real or invented, if they do not prefer the hard alternative of continuing their loading, and going away with a foul bill of health, to perform quarantine in some of the lazarettos in the Mediterranean; on the contrary, Dutch vessels may be three months in loading, they may have taken the greatest part of their cargo in whilst the plague raged, and notwithstanding this, if they are in port forty days after the last accident, clean bills of health are granted them, in virtue of which they only perform twenty-one days quarantine in the slovenly manner above mentioned.

Our government has reasonably laid a quarantine on cottons imported into England from Holland; but we understand that when this has been the case, the quarantine in Holland, such as it is, has been curtailed by the connivance of those who should regulate it: by this manoeuvre, the end of our government in laying a quarantine, is entirely defeated. This total disregard of so serious an object, as the regulation of quarantines must be, to all nations, gives so great an advantage to the Dutch Turkey trade over ours, that it induces their government, to overlook the risks the nation incurs by it; and when representations were made in Holland on the necessity of establishing a lazaretto to obviate this risk, and the fatal consequences which the introduction of the plague might be of to all Europe, the thrifty Hollanders, ever preferring the interests of their trade, to those of humanity, would not allow so forcible an argument to have any weight with them; but gave for answer, that it would be time enough to think of a lazaretto when the English had built one. The Dutch traders have so decided a superiority over us at our own markets, that it is only the necessity gentlemen are in to have returns, which can induce us to ship any cottons at all during the existence of the plague here; for by arriving after our markets are supplied, loaded besides with ten per cent. extra charges, incurred in the ports where they perform quarantine, they are sold to a considerable loss. This circumstance alone is sufficient to account for the present insignificance of our trade, and the consequent little advantage the nation reaps from it. In what a different situation would the establishment of a lazaretto put it? By depriving the Dutch of the advantages they now enjoy, we should be able to supply the whole quantity of cottons demanded at our markets; instead of only sending five thousand bales we should send more than double that quantity annually; and as by a fixed regulation of the Levant company, we can only purchase the products of this country with the produce of goods sent from England, the importation of our manufactures would increase in the same proportion. The quantity of shipping employed in the trade would likewise be doubled, and by earning the freight which

Sect. II. LAZARETTOS. 29

[Smyrna.]

[Merchants' Letter.]

is now paid to the Dutch, on the cottons they send to England, it would be so much clear gain to the nation, added to the advantages which would attend the extension of its navigation, and the increase of the consumption of its manufactures; advantages which are now enjoyed by our rivals the Dutch, the prosperity of whole trade is founded on the ruin of ours.

We are aware that the building of a lazaretto would cost the nation a considerable sum of money; but we think the commercial advantages it would derive from it would alone be more than a compensation for such a charge. It would not only be the ships which load in the ports of Turkey, but those from all the ports in the Mediterranean, which would contribute to its support.

Admitting, however, that the Turkey trade is not so far worth the notice of government as to induce it to build a lazaretto for it, the consideration alone of its preserving the nation from the great risk it now evidently runs of such a great calamity as the plague being introduced into it, we presume is of sufficient importance to make government determine on a measure which every state in Italy has considered so necessary, that the most insignificant amongst them have their lazarettos. The knowledge you have acquired of the plans and regulations of these, and every other lazaretto in Europe, in your present tour, is so much superior to any information we can give you, that we do not presume to trouble you on the subject.

Should your representations meet with the success they will deserve, the nation at large will experience in a new instance, the advantages that can be derived from the pursuits of a --- individual, who, from the noblest motives, dedicates himself to the interests of humanity, and we, as well as every other member of the Levant company, shall consider ourselves as indebted to you for the revival of our drooping trade."

"SIR,

"WE have carefully read the above letter addressed to you from the Factory of Smyrna on the subject of establishing a lazaretto in England, and find the reasons given by those gentlemen in favour of the same, so strong, and so exactly our own opinion on the subject, that we have nothing to add thereto, but to assure you, that we sincerely wish your endeavours may be crowned with success; as we are convinced the establishing a lazaretto in England will be a means of greatly increasing our trade to the Levant, and of guaranteeing the nation from the risk it now runs (in our opinion) of the plague

JOHN OLIVER,

BARTHOLOMEW EDW. ABBOTT.

Salonica, July 21, 1786.

To the foregoing letters, I will add the following reasons for a lazaretto in England, which I received from a very intelligent merchant in the Levant.

First. Our cotton manufactories will then be regularly supplied with Turkey cotton directly from the place of its growth, and consequently there will no longer be any occasion for their being supplied from Holland, France, and Italy, as has been too much, the case since the consumption of this article in England has become so very considerable, to the no small prejudice of the nation:* as such cottons purchased

* Perhaps the trade to Turkey is more beneficial than to any other country; for we there receive raw materials, which we return manufactured: for cottons, by articles of agreement with the Ottoman court, are not paid for in money, (as hemp, iron. &c. are in Russia) but by our manufactured goods. This trade though clogged is still considerable, as may appear from the exports in the year 1786.

in Turkey with the manufactures of the three nations above mentioned, are generally (I believe we may say always) again purchased for the London market with bills of exchange upon London; whereas, the cottons imported by the Levant company can only be purchased with the products of goods imported from England.

2. As it is calculated that at least one half of the cottons that are manufactured in England are purchased in Holland, France, and Italy;* and as these cottons, it is presumed will, after a lazaretto is built, be imported directly from the place of their growth, there will consequently be employed near double the tonnage now employed by the Levant company, to the no small advantage of the nation, arising from the clear profit of the freights, the increase of our navigation, and the increase of our exports in goods instead of specie.†

3. In answer to the objection that Turkey will not take off any more of our fabrics and staple commodities, than are now consumed there, it should be observed, that, as the importation of cotton into Holland, France and Italy, will decrease for want of the usual demand for the London market, their exports will also decrease in proportion; and consequently make room for a greater quantity of ours. The Dutch will no longer send our tin and lead adulterated to the Turkey markets. They and the French will send thither a less quantity of their cloth, and this will make more room for our shalloons, which have already begun to give a fatal blow there to the French cloth trade.

We may also supply the Turks with part of those East and West Indian commodities, which they now receive from the French, Dutch, and other nations.

4. The building of a lazaretto in England, and the prohibition of the importation of any Turkey goods, any other way than directly, will be the effectual means to prevent the introduction of the plague, of which there is now very great danger, on account of the cottons that come to us by way of Holland. These, though shipped in the Levant, in time of the plague, are, while under quarantine in Holland, never opened and aired, as is done in all the lazarettos in the Mediterranean, but forwarded to England in their original packages, where they perform again the same slovenly quarantine; and are then sent down to our manufacturing towns, where they are first unpacked, and where by this means the plague may very easily be introduced.

With regard to the danger of the introduction of the plague from Holland, the following translated quotation from Dr. Hodges's Treatise on the Plague of London in 1665, will confirm the opinion above stated. "With respect to the origin of our

* I am informed, that of eighteen thousand bags of Turkey cotton used in England, six thousand only are imported from Turkey in English bottoms. The rest we owe to Holland, Marseilles, and Leghorn.

† The employment of seamen is a point of importance to the public; for great numbers of those who were discharged at the conclusion of the late war, having been improvident and not readily finding employment, fell into vices which terminated in their ruin. Of this I was convinced by my late visits to the prisons.

32 THE PLAGUE. Sect. III.

"pestilence, I do not hesitate to affirm, from the fullest authority of undeniable testimony, that it first entered this island by means of contagion, and was brought from Holland in merchandise imported from that country, where it had made great ravages the preceding year; and if any one is desirous of inquiring further into its origin, I inform him, that if any credit is to be given to report, its feeds were brought into Holland from the Turkish empire, along with cotton, which is a most faithful preserver of contagion." Section II.

I will add that a lazaretto in England would prevent the following danger. Some merchants in the Levant, when the ships must come out with foul bills, send the cottons to the islands, or some other places which are clear of infection, there to perform quarantine. But this quarantine being (as I have seen) a very slight one, of only twenty days, and yet entitling the ships to clean bills with which they come to England, is by no means a sufficient security.

SECTION III.

PAPERS RELATIVE TO THE PLAGUE.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE PLAGUE.

ON my departure for my late tour, I was furnished by two of my medical friends. Dr. Aikin and Dr. Jebb, with a set of queries respecting the plague, to be put to some of the most experienced practitioners in the places which I meant to visit. I fulfilled this commission as well as I was able, and brought back the result in several papers in the French and Italian languages, which Dr. Atkin, to whose assistance I am indebted for a variety of professional matter in this work, has methodized and abridged so as to form one connected article. I here give it to the public; with a view of shewing the opinions prevalent concerning that disease in the countries where it is best known by experience, and thereby establishing some of the most important relative to its prevention.

Question First.

1. Is the Infection of the Plague frequently communicated by the Touch?

Raymond, Physician, Marseilles. It is sometimes so communicated.

Demollins, Surgeon, Marseilles. There are instances of persons in the lazaretto who touch infected things and bodies without catching the disease: which is to be attributed to their temperament of body.

Sect. III. THE PLAGUE. 33

Giovanelli, Physician to the Lazaretto at Leghorn. The plague cannot be communicated without very near approach or touch of an infected body or substance; and the air cannot be the vehicle of this infection.

They, Physician to the Lazaretto at Malta. All who approach the atmosphere of a pestilential body may receive the infection by respiration; and it is almost always observed that the contagion is received before approaching or touching the sick person. Yet it may happen that a person may inhabit the same chamber with, and even touch a patient in the plague without being infected; instances of which I have known.

Morandi, Physician, Venice. Contact is one of the most powerful and dangerous means of communicating the infection; but for the developement of its effects a predisposition in the receiving body is necessary.

Verdoni, Physician, Trieste. It is most frequently communicated by the touch. It has been given by a flower held and smelt at, first by two persons who remained free, then by a third, who was seized and died in twenty-four hours.

A Jew Physician of Smyrna. The infection is in reality communicated by the touch alone; for all who keep from contact of infected persons or things remain free. To the effect of contact, however, a certain disposition of the air is necessary; for we often see infected persons arrive from other countries, yet the disease does not spread. But what this disposition is, can scarcely be conceived. Commonly, in this climate, the disease appears at the end of spring, and continues to the middle of summer, with this particularity, that in cloudy weather, and during the sirocco wind, the attacks are more frequent. Also, in the same diathesis of the air, some receive the infection, while others exposed to the same dangers escape it. From observation it appears, that cachectic persons, and those of constitutions abounding in acid, do not readily take it. The contagious miasms may lie dormant in the body for some time without doing the least harm, till set in motion by sudden fear, or the excessive heat of a bath.

Fra. Luigi di Pavia, Prior of the Hospital of San Antonio at Smyrna. The plague is communicated by contact, according to all the observations I have been able to make for eighteen years.

[Question Second.]

2. Does the Plague ever rise spontaneously?

Raymond. Incontestible experience daily proves that it only proceeds from contact.

Demollins. From all ages, the plague has only been brought to Marseilles by merchandise, or persons from beyond sea.

Giovanelli. As the disease always appears with the same symptoms, it is probably not spontaneous, but the consequence of a particular contagion.

They. Some contagious fevers come of themselves; others proceed from the communication of contagion. The plague is thought to have originated in Egypt, and spread itself from thence.

34 THE PLAGUE Sect. III.

Morandi. Contagious fevers do not arise of themselves, but are always the product of a peculiar poison.

Verdoni. I know no fever that can properly be called contagious, and doubt if even the plague can be considered as such. My reasons are drawn from the very different manner in which the plague appears in different years; and the different degree in which it spreads. I therefore conclude that contagious fevers come of themselves.

Jew Physician. According to the most ancient authorities, the plague has always been brought to Smyrna by contagion, and was never produced here.

Fra. Luigi. Ancient and common observation in this city proves that the plague is derived solely from contagion.

[Question Third.]

3. To what distance is the Air round the patient infected? How far does actual contact - wearing infected clothes, or touching other things - produce the disease?

Raymond. The infected are conversed with without danger across a barrier which separates them only a few paces.

Demollins. The air round the patient is infected more or less according to the degree of the poison which exhales. Here, in the lazaretto, they are spoken with across two barriers a few paces from each other, without fear of contagion. Hence it would appear that the plague is communicated only by the touch, or still more by wearing infected clothes.

Giovanelli. If one speaks of an infected person shut up in an unventilated chamber, it may be said that the whole atmosphere is dangerous; but if one speaks of a patient exposed to the open air, it has been proved that the sphere of infection does not extend beyond five geometrical paces from his body. Beyond this distance one is in safety. The actual touch of an infected person or thing is proved to be very dangerous by fatal experience; but to what degree, is not ascertained.

They. The infection only extends some paces; and the miasms at the distance of about ten paces are so corrected by the air, as to lose all their activity. It may be communicated by touching infected things, especially of a porous nature, as cloth, wool, skins, &c.

Verdoni. From the moment of infection, to the time when nature has entirely dissipated the contagious principle, which usually happens in forty days, there is always a capacity of communicating infection. The degree of infection is in proportion to the volume of air surrounding the patient; the air being what absorbs, dissipates and destroys the contagious principle. Infected substances communicate the disease for many years, in proportion to the ventilation they have undergone, or of which they are susceptible.

Jew Physician. The degree of infection in the air about the sick depends upon the greater or less malignity of the disease, and other circumstances. The air about poor patients is more infectious than about the rich. These things being established, I am of

Sect. III. THE PLAGUE. 35

opinion, that in the greatest contagion one may securely see a patient at the distance of two ells (four braccia) if the chamber windows be not all shut.

Fra. Luipi. The infection is greater qr less in proportion to the yirulence of the contagion} but I have made no observation as to the distance. The disease is communicated by confaft of all iofected things, and by close inspiration of the breath of the sick.

[Question Fourth.]

4. What are the Seasons in which the Plague chiefly appears; and what is the interval between the Inflexion and the Disease.

Raymond. The plague shews itself at all seasons; but less at the two solstices.

Demollins. Great ravages may be made in all seasons; but principally in the greatest heats of summer.

From the infection to the disease is two or three days.

Giovanelli. The plague appears at all times, in the same manner as poisons at all times produce their effects. But observation shews that its ravages are greater in hot seasons than in cold; and it seems that summer and the first months of autumn are most to be dreaded.

There is no certainty as to the interval between the infection and the disease, as it depends on the particular constitution of the patient.

They. Warm moist seasons contribute to the production of all contagious diseases. The interval from the infection to the seizure is various, according to the virulence of the poison and the constitution of the patient. Sometimes it acts slowly, sometimes like a stroke of lightning.

Verdoni. The spring is the principal season.

Generally the disease shews itself at the instant of the touch, like an electrical shock. Sometimes a person retains the contagious principle without any sensible effect, and after several days communicates it unknowingly to a third, in whom, if predisposed to the disease, it becomes active; or otherwise, it may be communicated to others successively in the same way, till it becomes dissipated and annihilated, as happened at Smyrna in 1783.

In bodies predisposed it very rarely conceals itself till the third day.

Jew Physician. Answered in the first.

Fra. Luigi. The plague is most fatal in Smyrna from April to July; and it is constantly observed that great colds and heats much diminish it, and copious dews extinguish it.

The infection shews itself in twenty-four hours, more or less, according to the difference of temperament.

[Question Fifth.]

5. What are the first Symptoms of the Plague? - are they not frequently a swelling of the Glands of the Groin and Armpit?

36 THE PLAGUE. Sect. III.

Raymond. The plague often conceals itself under the form of an inflammatory, ardent, or malignant fever. Tumours of the glands are sometimes its first symptom.

Demollins. The first symptoms of the plague vary; but the most common are buboes in the armpit and groin, parotids, and carbuncles in various parts of the body.

Giovanelli. The first symptoms are, debility, fever, excessive thirst followed by great heat; after which, carbuncles or buboes appear in the parotids, armpits, and groin. This last is sooner attacked than the armpit.

They. Swellings in the armpits and groin are, indeed, the characteristics of the plague; yet they are neither the sole, nor the first symptoms; and often are not seen at all, as when the plague disguises itself under the form of other diseases.

Morandi. Glandular swellings are properly the symptom of the second stage, and are preceded by those febrile symptoms which are immediately consequent upon the reception of the contagion; such as, pain in the head, drowsiness, great prostration of strength, dryness of the tongue, vomiting, hiccough, tremor, diarrhoea.

Verdoni. Its first symptoms are relative to the constitution of the year, and of the body seized, and the place where it was produced, or whence it came. In 1783 all the parts of Natolia were infected; and the disease transported to Smyrna, which is in the centre, was extinguished without the death of a single person. Generally, the plague of Constantinople transported to Smyrna does little harm. That of Egypt causes havock as in every country. That of the Thebais is always cruel, and carried to lower Egypt is fatal. The inguinal glands are the most generally affected.

Jew Physician. The swelling of the glands is seldom the first symptom. Patients are every day seen, who, being supposed ill of another disorder, in two, three, or more days shew glandular swellings or carbuncles, by which the plague is manifested. On the contrary, many, who from the usual signs are supposed to have the plague, become well in a day or two without the least tumour or external appearance. The first symptoms are, horripilation, or actual shivering, nausea or vomiting, loss of strength, and fever. These are common to many diseases; but the pathognomonic signs are, a difference in the pulsations of the two sides, with this circumstance, that from this diversity a prognostic arises; it having been observed, that if the pulse on the side of the tumour or carbuncle be greater or more frequent, it bodes well; whereas if it be smaller, it shews greater malignity, and there is more to be feared. Further, there is observed among the first symptoms a visible pulsation in the carotids, greatest on the affected side; and also a crystalline vivacity in the eyes, with a kind of contraction and diminution of the eye on the side affected.

Fra. Luigi. The most remarkable symptoms of the plague are, turbidness and sparkling of the eyes, the tongue furred with a white mucus, and very red at its tip, frequent biting of the lips, violent pain in the head and inability to hold it up, a sense

Sect. III. THE PLAGUE. 37

of great cold in the loins, vomiting, debility. Swellings of the glands are not among the first symptoms.

[Question Sixth.]

6. Is it true that there are two different fevers with nearly the same one of which is properly termed the Plague, and is communicated from a distance by the and without contact; while the other, which is properly termed Contagion, is only communicated by the touch, or at least by near approach to infected persons or things

Morandi. It is certain from multiplied observations, that there are two sorts of pestilential fevers, similar in appearance; one of which proceeds from the contamination of the air alone, and is communicable to any distance; the other is produced alone by contact, or near approach. The former of these is properly termed a pestilential fever, the latter a contagious one.

Verdoni. The distinction of these fevers is useless, since the same which is communicated by the touch is that also which is conveyed by the air to a certain distance, especially in a close place.

Jew Physician. That there are two kinds of plague is absolutely to be denied; yet sometimes it happens that persons are attacked with the plague without knowing whence it came.

Fra. Luigi. I hold it for certain that there is only one species of plague, though differing in malignity.

[Seventh Question]

7. What is the Method of Treatment in the frist stage - what in the more advanced periods - what is known concerning Bark, Snakeroot, Wine, Opium, pure Air, the application of cold Water?

Raymond. The disease is treated as inflammatory. No specific has been discovered for it.

Demollins. At the beginning, bleeding, vomiting, purgatives, diluents, refrigerants and antiseptics are used; afterwards, antiseptics and cordials, relatively to the temperament and symptoms.

Giovanelli. The plague, causing_always a disposition to inflammation, and putrefaction, it is always proper to bleed proportionally to the strength, and to use a cooling regimen, with the vegetable acids. The repeated use of emetics is also proper, both to cleanse the first passages, and to dispose the virus to pass off by the skin, In the progress, it is necessary to favour the evacuation of the virus by that issue which nature seems to point at. Thus, either antiphlogistic purgatives are to be given, if nature points that way; or suppurative plasters are to be applied to any tumours which may appear. Epispastics to the extremities are proper where nature wants rousing. The vitriolic acid in large doses has been found very serviceable in the plague with carbuncles, as was proved in the last plague at Moscow. When the inflammation is over, and marks of suppuration

THE PLAGUE. Sect. III. 38

[Question Seventh.]

appear, the bark with wine and other cordials is proper. The surgeon's assistance is requisite in the treatment of boils and anthraxes, which last are seldom cured without the actual cautery.

They. In the beginning of pestilential fevers, bleeding is sometimes proper, and vomits almost always. In their progress, frequent subacid and cold drinks, the bark given liberally, and vitriolic acid, have been found powerful remedies when there was a dissolution of the blood.

Morandi. In the first period, evacuations according to the peculiar circumstances of the case are proper. In the second, bark mixed with wine; and opium as a temporary sedative. Pure air is very necessary; and fire, as a corrective, with the burning of antiseptic and aromatic substances.

Verdoni. As soon as a Christian finds he has got the plague, he eats caviare, garlic and pork; drinks brandy, vinegar and the like, to raise the buboes. Upon these he applies greasy wool, caviare, honey of roses, dried figs &c. to bring them to suppuration.

The Turks and Arabs drink bezoar in powder with milk, and other sudorifics, to expel the virus. They vomit, and possibly a second time.

At Cairo they take opium, and cover themselves with mattresses in order to excite sweat; and though parched with heat and thirst, they drink nothing. They open the immature buboes with a red-hot iron.

At Constantinople and Smyrna they eat nothing, and drink much water and lemonade. The Jews drink a decoction of citron feeds, lemon or Seville orange peel, and their own urine. They abstain scrupulously from animal food.

In 1700 a physician in Smyrna found bleeding very useful. Another, in another year, cured the plague by bleeding and an antiphlogistic regimen.

My brother in Cairo treated it like a pituitous biliary fever, with vomits, saponaceous attenuants, and antiphlogistics, and successfully.

Some sailors in Constantinople in the phrensy of the plague, have thrown themselves into the sea; and it is said that on being taken out, they have recovered.

My opinion upon the whole is, that the treatment ought to be relative to the particular constitution of the year, and of the patient, by which the nature of the disease itself is greatly varied.

Jew Physician. Bleeding in many cases may be serviceable, as I have known patients who were bled by mistake, recover; and others recovered from a most desperate condition by a spontaneous haemorrhage. On the other hand, persons have been apparently injured by both these circumstances. The difference of effect seems to depend on the state of the blood, whether it be disposed to coagulation or dissolution. In the former, bleeding is useful, in the latter, hurtful. Vomits according to my experience have not succeeded; yet I should not hesitate to try ipecacuanha in substance, exhibiting half a scruple at two or three times, in the expectation that in this manner it would not run downwards. Bark

Sect. III. THE PLAGUE. 39

may be of use in dissolutions of the blood; and also small doses of opium, and other medicines prudently administered. In excessive watchfulness I have known relief procured by anointing the temples with Ung. populeon. In a case of hiccough the Liquor Anod. Miner. Hoffmanni succeeded with me.

The Turks, in the violence of the fever, take handfuls of snow and apply it over their bodies, and also eat it; and likewise sometimes throw cold water on their feet. But whether this is of service or no, cannot be determined; as these people in other respects pay no regard to rules of diet.

Fra. Luigi. They who practise empirically in the plague use none of the recited methods, Shut only strong sudorifics, and ventilation of the air; and complete the cure by proper treatment of the sores from suppuration.

[Question Eighth.]

8. When the Plague prevails, do the physicians prescribe to those who have the disorder a more generous, or a more abstemious diet; and do they prescribe any thing to the uninfected?

Jew Physician. In times of the plague, many are accustomed to eat no flesh; others, no fish; but I know not whether from the advice of physicians. For myself, I have been in many plague-years, but have made no alteration in the management of myself.

Fra. Luigi. In Smyrna, the plague is generally treated with a rigorous diet. They only use rice and vermicelli boiled in water; and sometimes, when the patient is too costive, juices and herbs boiled without any seasoning. From time to time they give some acid preserves, and raisins, and in great heats some slender lemonade, and a dish of good coffee with a biscuit every day. For drink they only use toast and water; and they follow this abstemious regimen till the fortieth day of the disease is completed; after which they take chicken broth, lamb, and other food of easy digestion.

[Question Ninth.]

9. Are Convalescents subject to repeated attach from the same infection?

Raymond. Not unless they touch something infected.

Demollins. Convalescents are sent to fumigated chambers, and there are no instances of relapse.

Giovanelli. No instances of relapse after being well recovered from the first attack have come to my knowledge; but they are liable to fall into other disorders, as consumption, haemoptoe &c.

They. Convalescents are without doubt liable to a relapse, and authors are full of instances of it. In the plague of Medina, M. Cotogno says that a man had successively fourteen buboes, and was cured at last.

Morandi. All convalescents may relapse.

Verdoni. They have it not twice in the same year.

Jew Physician. Convalescents are often attacked anew, and die; but this does not usually happen from a fresh infection taken elsewhere, but from some remains of their own contagion, excited by intemperance in food, or the venereal act.

40 THE PLAGUE. Sect. III.*

Fra. Luigi. From irregularities in eating and drinking, bodily fatigue, affections of the mind, and especially anger, they are liable to repeated and very dangerous relapses.

[Question Tenth.]

10. What is the proportion of Deaths, and the length of the disease?

Raymond. The mortality is different in different seasons and years.

Demollins. In the plague of Marseilles in 1720 half the inhabitants perished. The usual length of the disease is that of other acute disorders, but longer when the tumours come to suppuration.

Giovanelli. The proportion of deaths is variable and uncertain. As to duration, when the disease is very acute and fatal, the patient generally dies within five days from the first invasion of the fever, or first marks of the plague. When he recovers, no certain termination can be assigned. If the time of healing all the fores be reckoned, it may run on to three, four, five months, or more.

They. The mortality is very various. Of ten whom I treated in the lazaretto, three died. I have observed that the fever usually runs on to twenty or twenty-one days.

Morandi. The bills of mortality of places visited by the plague usually amount to about thirty per cent, sometimes they rise to fifty. (He seems to mean of the whole number of inhabitants.)

Verdoni. The proportion of deaths varies infinitely. It has been observed that the Jews in Constantinople and Smyrna lose only one third, which is attributed to the care they take of their sick. At Cairo, on the other hand, they are the first attacked, and lose more than three fourths. The Turks lose two thirds; other nations a little more or less: the Europeans at Cairo lose five sixths.

Sometimes it kills immediately; sometimes in twenty-four hours; commonly in three days. When the patient gets over the ninth day, there are great hopes of recovery, as the buboes are then suppurated. They may, however, die within the fortieth day, especially if they commit any irregularity, the principal of which is eating flesh, which instantly causes a return of fever, and death. It never passes beyond the fortieth day.

Jew Physician. The mortality is various, as also the duration. Some die in two, three, or four days; some hold out six, eight or more.

Fra. Luigi. Generally more die than survive; but in our hospital of San Antonio of Smyrna, from the care taken of the sick, the number recovering has for eighteen years past exceeded that of the dead.

[Question Eleventh.]

11. What are the Means to prevent the Plague, to stop its contagion, and to purify infected places?

Raymond. There is no other method of preserving one's-self from the plague, than avoiding the contact of infected things. Goods are purified by exposing them to the open air during forty days; and furniture by a strong fumigation with aromatics and sulphur.

Sect. III. THE PLAGUE. 41

[Question Eleventh.]

Demollins. Here, in the lazaretto, infected goods and furniture are exposed to a current of air for forty days. The air of infected places is purified by burning all sorts of aromatic plants, and sulphur.

Giovanelli. The method of prevention is, to avoid all communication with infected persons or goods. The means of stopping the contagion form a body of police, too extensive to be here mentioned.

They. The means of prevention, besides avoiding infected things and persons, are, sobriety in living, the use of vinegar externally and internally, and an issue.

Infected places are purified by fumigation and ventilation, by scraping the lime from the walls (which is then thrown into the sea) and white-washing them anew with lime and sea water, by washing the floors, windows, doors &c. first with sea water, then with vinegar, taking great care to leave nothing that is infected. The bodies of the dead are buried in a place set apart for that purpose; and their beds and bedding are burned. As to other things, not used during the illness, the linen is washed with soap and ley; the woollen clothes are put into sea water for two days, and then ventilated for twenty days; those which would be spoiled by water are hung on a line in the air for forty days, and fumigated from time to time according to their quality.

Morandi. A fire is to be kept constantly in the sick chamber, in all seasons. All feces &c. are to be immediately removed. Clean shirt and sheets daily. The healthy must avoid commerce with the infected; must purge gently now and then, smoke tobacco, drink pure wine medicated with wormwood, gentian, zedoary &c. and avoid fear and other passions, and excess of all kinds.

Jew Physician. No means of prevention are used in the Turkish dominions.

Fra. Luigi. The means used for stopping the contagion are purifying places and things by fire, water, and air.

Verdoni. The best preservatives are reckoned to be, sprinkling the room with vinegar, perfumes, ventilation, and fumigation. The Greeks in Smyrna, during Lent, when they eat only vegetables, are very seldom attacked; while among those who eat flesh the contagion makes great havock. Hence the best means of prevention are to eat moderately, and not at all of animal food; to drink water and vinegar;* to sprinkle the chamber with the latter, and use frequent ventilation; to change the clothes, especially the linen, daily, hanging in the air for ten or fifteen days those that have been used. For suppressing the infection, every thing is to be washed that can undergo the operation, and the walls of the chamber to be whitened with lime; but after the 24th of June no further care is taken.

* A person in a very high station at Constantinople, told me, that when he had the plague in that city, he lived almost entirely on green tea; to which he attributed his perfect cure of that disorder: and I must add, I have heard of some who have made the same use of brandy, and yet have recovered.

42 THE PLAGUE. Sect. III.

OBSERVATIONS.

[Observations.]

Though there are various points in which the answerers of the preceding questions disagree, yet it is with pleasure I observe that they all in the most explicit manner concur in representing the plague as a contagious disease, communicated by near approach to, or actual contact with infected persons or things. This is a fact of the greatest importance to be established, as all the proposed means of prevention by cutting off communication with the sources of infection, must depend upon it: it is a fact too, which one would suppose after such manifold and repeated experience, no one would now call in question. Yet a late medical writer of reputation, Dr. Maximilian Stoll of Vienna, has not scrupled publicly to hazard an opinion, that the plague is not contagious; and this even with a view to the natural but most dangerous consequence, that the usual means of preventing its spread from one country to another by restrictions on commercial intercourse, are unnecessary and improper. This doctrine is asserted in his Rationis Medendi, pars secunda, printed at Vienna in 1778 (Vid. p. 59 and seq.). It does not belong to me to enter into a medical disputation on this head; yet I cannot avoid observing, that it appears very strange and suspicious, that he should go back to Livy's Roman History for proofs to establish his point, totally neglecting all the facts concerning the numerous visitations of the plague recorded in modern medical books, or which had happened during his own time. I suppose professional men will lay very

The ingenious Dr. Schotte, in a treatise on a contagious fever, which raged at Senegal in the year 1778, and proved fatal to the greatest part of the Europeans, and to a number of the natives, (published in 1782 by Murray in Fleet-street) considers the following among the predisposing causes of the disease:- the garrison subsisting, during the whole year, chiefly upon animal food, particularly upon fresh beef which is supplied by the Moors;- the brackish well-water in which their victuals are boiled, and which serves them as constant drink;- the impure air breathed by many of the slaves, who are locked up together in the same room during the night;- and the want of motion during the day time, which the irons on their feet impose on them.

Among the means of preventing the disease, the doctor mentions the necessity of temperance in eating, drinking &c. yet he acknowledges that governor Clarke lived very regularly in every respect; he "took the tincture of bark and bitters three times a day, and used every other precaution to avert the disease, but ineffectually." This German physician has said much in praise of wine, and tells us: "From my own experience I believe that wine has in some degree a power of expelling a newly-received infection, or at least of contributing towards expulsion. And the use of this with sarsaparilla he thinks was the means of curing himself of that disease; yet" he adds, page 158; "as the only European, who escaped this disease entirely, did not make the least use of any spirituous liquor, I would confine my advice to such persons only, as are accustomed to it The person in question, who affords this very striking exception, is a Mr. Hare, master of a merchant ship, who had been at Senegal backwards and forwards for several times, but was residing there, at the time the disease raged, and for two years before. He was more exposed to the infection than many others, for he lived in the house of a dreadful-looking patient, who was swelled and puffed up, before he died, like a putrid corpse. He also waited on him out of humanity day and night, because the blacks were afraid of going near him, on account of his most dreadful appearance. He never drank a drop of any spirituous liquor, not even beer or cyder, and he told me, that he had not for ten years past, but that he had made use of it before that time. His only drink at meals was water, and plenty of tea and coffee in the morning and afternoon. He made not the least use of tobacco in any form, and took no precaution whatever to prevent the infection."

Sect. III. THE PLAGUE. 43

[Observations.]

little stress upon all that can be said of pestilential diseases in general which happened in wars and sieges two thousand years ago, as applied to the plague properly so called, a disease then confounded with various others, from which the accuracy of later observations have sufficiently discriminated it. This extraordinary mode of reasoning on such an important subject, too much confirms the account I received of the matter in Germany; which was, that with a view of ingratiating himself with the prince in whose service he lived, and who might be supposed desirous of getting rid of the expense and inconvenience of lazarettos and other establishments for the prevention of contagion. Dr. Stoll had been induced to make an attack upon the principle upon which every precaution of this kind must depend.* I must, however, observe in his vindication, that at the beginning of this century, the faculty of medicine in Paris gave a decisive opinion against the contagious nature of the plague, and their delegates acted conformably to this doctrine in the case of the dreadful visitation of Marseilles in 1720: the bad effects of which prepossession are shewn in a very sensible manner by Mr. Bertrand in his admirable relation of that calamity. It is also observable, that in the foregoing answers. Dr. Verdoni, in replying to the second query, from theory denies that any fever can properly be termed contagious, though under some of the other heads of inquiry, he asserts with as much confidence as the rest, that the plague is actually communicated by contact. Such are the effects of a preconceived hypothesis in perplexing or obscuring the plainest matter of fact!

ABSTRACT OF A CURATIVE AND PRESERVATIVE METHOD

TO BE OBSERVED IN PESTILENTIAL CONTAGIONS:

Drawn up by Order of the Magistrates of Health at Venice, at the Request of the Court of Russia. By Giambatista Paitoni, first Physician.

MARCH 1, 1784.

[Abstract.]

No certain distinguishing sign of the plague, not even buboes, carbuncles &c. but only made manifest by its ravages. - Mistakes of great physicians in this matter: - when equivocal symptoms occur, it is prudent immediately to use precautions, especially the separation of suspected persons. - No specific hitherto discovered. - The essence of the pestilential contagion probably always the same; and the variety of phenomena observed in its different visitations, owing to differences in climate, air, seasons, mode of living &c. - This contagion, a very subtle and penetrating poison acting directly upon the nervous system; which must prove fatal if not expelled. - Hence all those remedies which tend to invigorate the natural powers are proper; and

* Have not some of our Professors, sullied their names with such dangerous doctrines? - From no other cause than the error of the physicians, who constantly maintained that the disease then epidemic was not contagious, happened that terrible visitation which in 1743 ravaged the city of Messina and its vicinity, with the loss of above forty-three thousand individuals, in the short space of only three months.

44 THE PLAGUE. Sect. III.

[Venetian Abstract.]

those which debilitate, hurtful. - Bleeding, therefore, not admissible. - Nor purging. - Two modes of effecting a cure; one by art, the other by nature.

1. That by art is the use of sudorifics, recommended by many writers of the highest reputation, particularly, Sydenham and Diemerbroeck. - Simples for this purpose, viz. contrayerva, serpent. virg. rad. angel, emuela campan. petasitis, gentian, camphor &c. Compounds, theriaca, mithridate, diascordium &c. - Camphor, sulphur, and theriaca preferred. - This method to be put in practice without delay. - To begin with frictions with fumigated cloths. - Fomentations. - Copious drinking, particularly water with best vinegar. - Not to be allowed to sleep during the sweat, nor to change linen till it be finished. - Diaphoretics from time to time. - No ventilation of the chamber during the sweat; but fumigation with aromatics, sprinkling vinegar, a fire if cold weather.

2. The natural method of cure is the expulsion of the poison to the glands and skin. Of these external appearances, buboes are the most important and useful. - They should not be livid or black, soft or puffy, nor increase all at once to a great size. - When they have begun to appear, the sweating plan should not be adopted. - To be quickly brought to suppuration, by emollient and gummy plasters; and either suffered to open spontaneously, or opened by art, but not till perfectly maturated. - Carbuncles less favourable than buboes: - to be treated mildly, and not with cautery and incision:- cataplasms or plasters of emollient herbs to be used; then ointments, cerates &c.

If particular symptoms are unusually troublesome, they must be attended to separately. Of these the most considerable is fever. - This is sometimes periodical, and then bark is proper.

Cutaneous efflorefcences are dangerous; petechiae, if livid or black, almost always fatal.

Diarrhoeas and haemorrhages from any part, dangerous, and should be stopt as soon as possible.

For obstinate vomitings, the best remedy is lemon juice and salt of wormwood.

Somnolency and watchfulness are each at times prevalent. The former to be prevented by agreeable discourse, or smelling to volatiles; the latter, by theriaca or diascordium. The same electuaries alone, or joined with camphor or castor, may be given in head-ach or delirium, at the same time enjoining perfect quiet.

Fainting and deliquiums to be treated with aromatics and cordials; convulsive motions, coughs, difficult respiration &c. to be gently quieted with theriaca, but not the warmer opiates. - Terror and despair great enemies to patients in this disease, preventing the salutary operations of the system. - To be removed by proper discourse, exhortation, hope &c.

PRESERVATION FROM THE PLAGUE.

To dwell in houses well detached from the infected, and admit no infected person or thing. - Habitation kept clean, and all filth removed. - Ventilation. - Windows only open while the sun is up. - Fires in each chamber, especially of odorous woods. - Flowers and aromatics strewed in the rooms. - Sprinkling with vinegar. - Fumigations with resinous and balsamic matters.

ABRIDGMENT OF A RELATION OF THE PLAGUE OF SPALATO

IN THE YEAR 1784,

Given in a Letter from an Officer to his Fellow-Citizen Venice.

PRINTED AT VENICE IN 1784.

[Spalato Abridgment.]

In July 1782 the plague was reported to be in Turkish Bosnia, and a line of troops in consequence was posted on the frontiers; but on the news that the disease was only a common epidemic, this was withdrawn. The plague, however, breaking out with great fury in the capital city of Serraglio, the line was again placed in June 1783.

The danger was the greater, as in the famine of 1782 many inhabitants of Venetian Dalmatia had gone into the adjacent Imperial and Turkish territories, whence it might be expected that they would now return.

At the end of June 1783 the plague broke out in the town of Dolaz in Paglizza, where it was brought by the returning emigrants.

Caserns, or wooden huts, were erected for the reception of all the emigrants, under the inspection of the military posts in the frontiers.

In August, the disease appeared among the caserns, near the post of Billibrigh, and spread to the national militia there encamped.

Soon after, it appeared in the large town of Etuazza in the territory of Sign, and spread to many other places of that district.

In September, the plague broke out in the suburbs of Cliffa, the territory of which immediately borders on that of Spalato, on which account a reparation was made by means of stockades and bars. The maritime towns and islands were still allowed free communication with each other.

46 Sect. III. THE PLAGUE.

[Spalato Abridgment.]

In October, the territory of Knin appeared to be infected.

The district of Cliffa was first freed from the contagion, its quarantines being completed in February 1784, after the death of three hundred and twenty persons.

Next to that, the territory of Knin became free, with the loss of two hundred and sixteen.

Lastly, Sign was disinfected, after twelve hundred and seventy-six deaths.

On January 30th, 1784, one Simon Chiapiglia of the borough of Luzaz, adjoining to Spalato, after a fever of five days, was found to have a tumour in the groin of a suspicious nature, especially as he had been employed as a porter in a lazaretto, from whence, after his quarantine, he had been dismissed on January 2 1st. He was put under close guard, but the next day, being delirious and attempting to escape, he was shot by the centinel, and killed. No further marks of suspicion appeared on the body. His family were put in the lazaretto, but remained in health.

On February 5th, a boy died after an illness of four days on board a Rovignese vessel, laden with wool, skins, bags &c. belonging to Ottoman subjects of Bosnia, which goods had undergone purification in a lazaretto. The boy's disease was declared by the physician to be only a verminous fever. The vessel sailed away on February 9th, and on the 21st put into Porto Cigalle in the island of Lossin Piccolo, where the master and two sailors were taken ill, and soon died. This excited an alarm, and the two remaining sailors and goods were put in a lazaretto, along with three galley slaves, and all underwent a thorough purification. But neither these sailors, who wore the clothes of their deceased comrades, nor the slaves, were attacked with any sickness.

On the 10th of March, some deaths, after short illness, began to take place in Spalato; in such, however, the physicians recognized no contagious quality.

On March 15th, a woman died with petechiae, which caused so much suspicion that the physicians recommended particular precautions with respect to all who had been about her, or handled the body.

Other suspicious deaths succeeded, but without certain proof of contagion; however on the night between March 28th and 29th, six deaths happening after a very short illness, caused the reality of the contagion to be scarcely doubted of, though still the signs of the plague were equivocal.

On March 30th, news arrived that the persons placed in the lazaretto from suspicion on account of the woman above mentioned, had fallen ill. Five more died this night; and on the view of their bodies, the physicians declared them suspected; but a Venetian surgeon did not scruple to call the disease openly the plague. A buboe was this day found on a patient.

The Proveditor General now assembled the college of health, and laid an interdict on the whole city, shutting up the churches, and cutting off all communication with the rest of the province.

He himself with the public officers, soldiers &c. to the number of one hundred and nineteen persons, shut themselves up in the generality-palace, situated without the city, but contiguous to the walls.

Sect. III. THE PLAGUE. 47

[Spalato Abridgment.]

All the cities in the different territories had orders to separate themselves from each other, and the coast-line of troops was armed.

The public lazaretto was also detached within proper limits.

On April 3d, the proveditor issued the proclamation annexed, for the regulation of the city.

The contagion now began to spread in every part of the city and suburbs, and through all ranks of people. It got even into a monastery, where an abbess and some nuns died.

The first mode of separation practised, was to place a large number of wine-vats in a certain part called Brecchia, to serve as receptacles for the most suspected persons of the city, who were taken out of the infected houses, and lodged there.

A large house, and some other adjacent ones in the borough of Luzaz were then set apart as an hospital for the infected.

A camp was then formed in St. Stefano, a remote and open place, into which the suspected, after washing in the sea, and change of all their garments, were taken. Many soldiers and town's people were received into this, most of whom were thereby preserved from infection.

Another camp was afterwards formed, in a different situation, for the same purpose. All these were provided with a deputation of health from the city, guardians, officers, inspectors &c. and a report from them was sent every morning to the supreme authority.

A second hospital was established in another part of the suburbs.

The quarter of St. Domenico was evacuated of its inhabitants, and applied to the purpose of a lazaretto; and a convent in it was reserved for the nobility and principal families.

Forty-six days had now elapsed since the manifest eruption of the plague, and yet no accident had happened in the generality-palace, when suddenly two galley slaves employed there were seized and died; but it was impossible to discover how they caught it. On this account, the proveditor, accompanied only by the persons most necessary to the management of public business, seceded to Castello Vitturi, and the rest were sent to the lazarettos.

In an infected city there are three conditions of suspected persons.

1. Simply suspected. These include all the inhabitants of the city, and they are allowed to walk about freely with the proper cautions, and at certain hours.

2. Grievously suspected. These are such as have had any communication with persons infected: they are confined to their habitations.

3. Most suspected; who are those in whose families the disease has appeared. These are removed from their houses, and after the sick are sent to the hospital, the rest are sent to the camps, where huts are erected for each individual; in which having passed forty days, they afterwards spend forty more in a lazaretto.

The convalescents were placed in a lazaretto by themselves.

As it was desireable to clear the city as much as possible of inhabitants, many of the families of nobility were received into the palace after it had been purified; and many goods of all kinds were sent to the lazarettos for purification.

48 THE PLAGUE. Sect. III.

[Spalato Abridgment.]

The dead were conveyed from distant parts to the burying ground, by water, in boats towed by other boats.

From May 25th the mortality began to abate, and this diminution continued, till June 29th, after which none died.

The city of Spalato contains three thousand two hundred inhabitants, and the boroughs about nine thousand. The whole number of deaths was one thousand two hundred and one.

REGULATIONS

Enjoined by his Excellency Francesco Falier, Proveditor General in Dalmatia and Albania for the Republic of Venice, and Delegate of Health, during the Prevalence of the Plague in the City of Spalato.

DATED, APRIL 3, 1784.

1. The general contumacy* and interdict of all the families of this city, already preferred by the college of health, being confirmed; the respective individuals of the same shall not be permitted to go abroad, excepting only the heads of families, in the times, manners, and with the notices to be declared.

3. The city is to be divided into six or more districts, according to the judgment of the representatives and college, that the visits and inspections may be rendered more easy to be practised.

4. To each district shall be assigned by the most reverend the Vicar Capitolary, a canon and a priest of the most active and capable, that in conjunction with a deputy appointed by the college, and under the conduct of a guardian of health, they may zealously perform every morning, with the due precautions, the visit of all the houses, in order to ascertain the state of health of each individual, and make a return of the same to the proper office of health.

5. At sun rising, or at the hour which shall be agreed on by the college, the reverend canons and priests selected for the purpose, shall without fail assemble in the sacristy of the cathedral, in order to proceed to the business of their inspections.

6. At the founding of the great bell of the cathedral, which is to follow at that hour which shall be fixed by the college, and shall serve to give time for the visits, the heads of families may freely go abroad, as in the first and second articles, so that the public vigilance may remain secured that the enjoined visits have been practised; excluding in this rule the magistrates, deputies, ministers and servants of the office of health, to whom it shall be permitted to go out of their houses, and walk through the city, as shall be hereafter declared.

* Contumacia in Italian means the state of reparation and seclusion in which suspected persons are placed during the plague.

Sect. III. THE PLAGUE. 49

[Spalato Regulations.]

7. The ringing of the said bell shall continue for the space of half an hour, that of every other bell, either of a church or other place, being absolutely prohibited.

8. Those persons alone who sustain public deputations, or other inspections of health, or military office, shall leave their houses before the sound of the bell, and continue to that hour which their business or office may require; with the injunction, however, that those who have no public charge or inspection, shall return to their own houses at six in the evening under the most rigorous penalties.

9. Whoever finds himself attacked with a disorder of any kind, shall immediately make it known to the deputation at their visit; and if at the moment of the attack the visiting hour shall be passed, he shall immediately give information of it to the office of health, so that it may directly fall under the notice of the established deputation, and they may apply the suitable remedies; declaring that any one who conceals his own sickness, or in any manner or under any pretext concurs in such shall incur, in the fact, the penalty of death.

10. On notice given of any kind of distemper to the office of health, the house in which it is verified shall immediately be interdicted, until the medical professors shall have made the necessary inspection, and determined the quality and true character of the disease.

11. Whoever, belonging to houses interdicted and guarded on account of deaths happening in them, or any other cause of suspicion, shall dare by themselves, or by the mediation of other persons, or in any other manner, to remove susceptible effects into any other house or place, shall be understood to have incurred the penalty of death; and in like manner every one who has assisted in, or contented to such removal, or has not disclosed it on knowing it.

12. Whoever shall have about him susceptible effects or goods of houses declared infected, shall immediately make it known to the office or the deputation of health, under pain of death; and if there shall have been goods belonging to the said infected houses hidden and concealed by the individuals of the same, they shall equally of themselves make known the place where they are, on pain of death, to which they will irremissibly be subjected; as, on the other hand, on disclosing them, they may be assured, on the pledge of the public faith, that when every thing is purified, it shall be carefully restored to the owners.

13. The resolution of the college respecting the shutting up of all the churches of this city remains confirmed; and all assemblies in all other places are to be considered as prohibited.

14. The zeal of the most reverend the Vicar Capitolary excites him to command those religious which he shall appoint among the most capable and active, to aid and assist by every possible means the infected and suspected poor of the separated houses, and always, with the due cautions, to administer to the same the spiritual comforts of the most holy sacraments, exhorting and animating them not to distrust the merciful aid of heaven.

50 Sect. III. THE PLAGUE.

[Spalato Regulations.]

15. And since in this city there is a ward of Jews, a nation singidarly to be observed on such an occasion, the college shall therefore select from the most able and honest individuals of the said nation such a number of deputies as they shall think fit, in order that they may watch over the internal government of their people, and the necessary provision for their support.

16. To this effect, it shall be permitted to those persons alone who are recognized as the most prudent to go out of the Jews ward, always provided with a bill of health, in order that they may attend to their own concerns, and those of others; and these persons shall be notified by the above mentioned Jewish deputies to the office of health.

17. All other persons shall continue within the precincts of their own ward, without going out of it on any cause or pretext whatsoever.

18. All the gates of the Jews ward shall be shut, except the great one alone, guarded by the usual guards, who however shall be of the deputation appointed by the college; and this gate shall be without fail shut at six in the evening, so that no one may go out of the ward.

19. There shall also be appointed by the college two deputies, of the best abilities, out of the body of the Jewish nation, who, escorted by a foot soldier, shall be charged to visit all the houses after sun rise, to inform themselves of the state of health of all the families; and if any person be found sick, to interdict immediately the house, and give notice without delay, of the circumstance to the office of health, in order for proper inspection and care.

20. It is understood that their synagogueis shut, and all their functions suspended, so that no assemblies of any sort shall be held among them.

21. All the dogs and cats which shall be found wandering either in the city or the Jews ward, as being capable in the present conjuncture of causing dangerous effects, shall be killed; to which purpose, the official inspectors, the deputies, and all other public persons of suitable rank, shall be respectively charged with the most absolute orders.

22. The canons, priests, and deputies of visitation of the respective districts, every morning after they have performed their visit, shall report to the commissioners and to the college all the incidents and discoveries that they have met with, in writing, and specifying the district, name and surname of the families infected or suspected, and the number of which each family consists.

23. Every death which happens shall immediately be returned to the commissioners and the college, with injunction to the physicians, surgeons, and deputies of inspection to bring the attestation of the circumstances of the case, and examination of the body to the same commissioners and office of health without delay.

24. All the respective deputations that shall have particular inspection committed to them by the college concerning the events of the contagion, prevention of the same, or other business, shall every day report to the commissioners and college what has happened with relation to their inspection, in order that all events of every kind may be always at hand, for the fake of timely prevention.

Sect. III. THE PLAGUE. 51

[Spalato Regulations.]

25. And because, amidst the particular objects of attention which ought to be had on such an occasion, it is a very important one, to lighten the city of mendicants, among whom, as among all the lower class, the disease is wont peculiarly to rage, on this account, we confirm the disposition already made by the college for uniting the said mendicants in a suitable place; and the commissioners resolve that they are to be collected and passed over to the Fort of Grippi, chosen for this purpose, where they may remain apart from the city.

26. The college shall appoint a deputy to visit every day in conjunction with a physician and surgeon the said persons, in order to be assured of their state of health, and preserve them if possible from any misfortune.

27. The public charity having condescended to grant to the said mendicants a relief of eight gazettes a head, there shall be appointed by the public representatives one or more persons of probity and activity, in order that with the sum resulting from the whole number, they may be daily, and at proper hours provided with food and necessaries, so as not to perish through want.

28. It shall be the duty of the said persons deputed, to report every morning to the commissioners and representatives the number of the said poor; and also both to the commissioners and the college their state of health, and all incidents relative to them.

29. The public charity being in like manner disposed to give assistance to the poor and indigent inhabitants of the interdicted houses, which otherwise could not maintain themselves, and having fixed the relief of one lira of Dalmatia a head during the distressed situation in which they are placed, the said representatives shall appoint two or more capable and active deputies, who may every day review the number of such poor, to adjust, day by day, the return of them to be made to the commissioners and representatives.

30. There shall be appointed by the said representatives persons of activity and probity, who, with the aggregate of the sums granted, may make provision for the said poor according to their condition and wants, with that and attention that their situation demands; and they shall render an account to the representatives, in order to obtain the necessary sums as occasion requires.

Francesco Falier, Proveditor General in Dalmatia and Albania.

SECTION IV.

AN ACCOUNT OF FOREIGN PRISONS AND HOSPITALS.

[Lyons.]

I set out on my last foreign tour in November 1785, and went first to Holland. I stayed there a few weeks, and made some observations on the prisons and hospitals. But I will defer my account of these observations; and begin with the prisons and hospitals at Lyons in France. I was there in the latter end of December;

[St. Joseph Prison.]

and in the prison of St. Joseph there were then about sixty criminals in the inner court, and fourteen in the dark dungeons twelve steps under ground. I perceived, however, some effects of a more liberal spirit towards the prisoners than I had seen in my former visit; for several who were confined in the dungeons at night, were in the day permitted to be in the court; and a new prison is building in which there will be no dungeons, and the rooms for the separation of prisoners, will be less close and confined.

[La Quarantaine.]

La Quarantine (a house built on the bank of the Soane, without the city, for those who fled from the plague at Marseilles in 1720) is now used as a prison for vagabonds and beggars. These are lodged in ten lofty and airy rooms twenty feet square, which open into a corridor about ten feet wide. There are several other rooms, some of which I found occupied by venereal patients.† All the rooms have opposite windows for giving a free passage to the air; and there is also plenty of water constantly running into stone troughs.‡

[General Hospital.]

La Charité, or the General Hospital, is an excellent institution, the establishment of which was occasioned by a dreadful famine in France in 1531. The first distribution of bread, during that calamity, was here made to many thousands who crowded into the city. The silk manufacture also, by which the trade of this flourishing city has been so greatly increased, began at that time: and a large manufacture is still carried on in this

* An architect, who was employed in finishing the draught of the new prison at Tholouse, told me, that it was built on arcades; had a surrounding wall, and no dungeons; and that each prisoner was confined without irons, in a room about eight feet square and ten high. This information was confirmed to me by an inhabitant of that city.

† Here I saw the surgeon stupify many of the female patients, by the new and dangerous deception of animal magnetism,

‡ In the court where I was confined in the lazaretto at Venice, there is a large well, and at the side of it an ancient circular stone-basin, which still continues very convenient for washing the linen of those in quarantine. I have seen such conveniences in the prisons in Spain, and have often wished to see them in our own prisons.

Sect. IV. FRANCE. 53

[Lyons General Hospital.]

hospital, in which a great number of children are employed, who are clean, and neatly clothed in - black - white - and blue, to distinguish - the foundlings - legitimate children abandoned by their parents - and orphans. These children are kept in the house till so late an age as twenty-five, that they may contribute somewhat to the expense of their education, and also be better able to maintain themselves after being discharged.

[Hôtel-Dieu.]

I was surprised to find the state of the Hôtel-Dieu so different as it was, from my former account. But having not then seen the well-regulated hospitals of Italy and Spain, perhaps I was now too much struck with the difference; and, perhaps also, an allowance should be made for my now seeing this hospital in the depth of winter. The summer white furniture of the beds was changed into a dirty blue harrateen, with useless fringes, well fitted to retain infection. The rooms were nasty and offensive; and two patients in many of the beds, but not one window open; the medical gentlemen here, and also the charitable sisters, being prejudiced against a free circulation of air, as well as against keeping rooms clean by washing them.

There are particular rooms destined for such of the sick as pay twenty-five sous a day.

These always lie single, and have some little distinction in their diet. There is also a room for the purpose of distributing medicines three times a week. An account of these, and many other particulars respecting this extensive charity, may be seen in a small volume, quarto, entitled, Statute et Reglements Generaux de l'Hôtel-Dieu de la ville de Lyon.

A society in this city, called, La Confrairie de la Misericorde, was established in 1636, of the same kind with one which I formerly found in Italy, and whose principal object is, visiting, assisting, and succouring prisoners.

[Avignon Prison.]

At Avignon, the Prison for the province is in the old palace, in which are two large and lofty rooms for men, and one for women, with a chapel. The prisoners, January 7, 1786, were fifteen in number, all men, and none in irons. The cruelty of irons would here be very evident; for the thickness of the stone walls, the proximity of the gaoler's apartment, and the fierceness of his dogs, must prevent an escape. On taking notice of the rings, pullies, &c. for the torture; the gaoler told me, he had seen drops of blood mixed with the sweat, on the breasts of some who had suffered the torture.

The allowance to the prisoners is one pound and a half of bread a day; but on Sundays and Thursdays they are supplied with a white loaf, broth and wine, by Les Freres de misericorde, who also bring them clean linen, every week in summer, and once a fortnight in winter. When a criminal is condemned to death, he is informed of his sentence at midnight; and at this hour, these charitable brethren go to him, and conduct him to the chapel; where they continue with him till he is executed, which is about ten o'clock the next morning.

* I procured a publication in quarto, entitled, Institution de l'Aumesne generale de Lyon. Sixieme edition. A Lyon, 1662, in which are many curious particulars, with the plan and regulations of the original hospital.

54 FOREIGN PRISONS &c. Sect. IV.

[Avignon Hospital.]

The Hospital contains two spacious wards for men, and two over them for women, with an altar at the end of each ward. The patients are clothed in an uniform; and they lie single, in beds about eight feet asunder. At the foot of each bed is written the patient's name, place of abode, entrance and diet; and likewise the prescriptions of the doctors, who, as well as the religieuses make their visits every day. More attention seems to be paid here to cleanliness and air than at Lyons; but yet the surgeon complained that the slow (hospital) fever was produced by the infectious air of the house.

[Marseilles.]

At Marseilles, the Prison at the palace is small, and in January 1786, was crowded with prisoners. The court and rooms below are for criminals, the rooms above for debtors. The criminals (about sixty) lay on barracks, with straw mattresses; most of them were very dirty, but especially the sick. Their bread was good; the allowance two pounds a day; and I was informed that Les Freres de misericorde supply them with soup every day, and with clean linen once a week, and visit the prison twice a week.

[Hospital.]

In the great Hospital, the patients had iron bedsteads, with curtains and testers. On the side of the wards there are covered walks or terraces; very necessary for hospitals in cities, which have not the advantage of gardens for convalescent patients. There is a new staircase, which is easy and convenient for the sick (being six feet wide, the steps sixteen inches broad, the rises three indches and a half) and, very properly, all of stone, with iron rails.

[Toulon Galleys.]

The Galleys, formerly at Marseilles, are now removed to the arsenal at Toulon. Five were moored near each other, and have their names on the stern, as the Firm, the Brave, the Intrepid &c. In them there were about sixteen hundred prisoners, who are obliged always to wear a bonnet or cap, on which is fixed a tin plate with a number. Their caps were grey - green - and red, to distinguish, - deserters - smugglers - and thieves; these last are always branded before they leave the prison of the place where they were condemned; some with the letter V (for Voleur) others with GAL. on the left shoulder.

These galleys had only one deck. Many of their windows in the roofs were open; and, being swept twice every day, they were clean, and not offensive. The slaves also were kept clean, and their clothing was neat, even in that galley which is appropriated to the aged and infirm. Some of them had been confined forty, fifty, and even sixty years. All have a coat, waistcoat, trousers, two shirts, and a pair of shoes, given them every year; and a great coat every two years. They had good brown bread, well baked, in loaves weighing a pound and three quarters. All had some little allowance in money, and to those who worked was granted an additional allowance of three sous every day for wine. In each galley there were two cantons (little rooms) one for wine, for those who worked for government, the other for the sale of white bread, greens &c.

* I have wished, from a regard to the health of the prisoners, that these friars would employ part of their charity in donations to those of the prisoners who are most cleanly in their persons and rooms; and in procuring the courts to be washed, and the prison to be lime-whited, as criminals will gladly work, when in prison, for one-fourth of what they could earn, were they not in confinement.

Sect. IV. FRANCE. 55

[Toulon Galleys.]

Many worked at their own trades, as shoe-makers, basket-makers &c. but none were allowed to keep shops on shore as formerly at Marseilles; nor have they the same convenience they had then for the sale of their work.

[La Place.]

Forty were at work in La Place (the square) in the city, digging and removing the soil for the foundation of a house for the intendant.* These were chained two and two, and when one wheeled the mould, the other carried the chain; but in digging, sawing, and other stationary employments, both worked.

[Arsenal.]

Many were at work in the Arsenal; and employed, some in moving, hewing and sawing timber; and others in the cotton and thread manufactory. The number of those engaged in the last of these employments was about two hundred. They were lodged in an adjoining hall; and I observed, that when they left off work they were searched to prevent their secreting any of the materials. All were loaded with chains of some kind or other. Those employed in the manufactory (and some others in the arsenal) had only a ring on one leg; but this, and likewise the choice of irons, I found to be a distinction which might be purchased. The slaves who worked out of the arsenal were loaded with heavy chains; and few are able to escape: if any do escape, they are punished, when retaken, in various ways. - Some by a confinement under heavier irons - Some by a recommencement of the term of their confinement - Some by whipping - And such as had been condemned for life, by hanging.

Protestants are not compelled to attend at mass. The last person who was confined for his religion, was released about eight years ago. There is but one slave here who now professes himself a protestant, and his name is Francois Conde. He has been confined in

the galleys forty-two years, for being concerned with some boys in a quarrel, with a gentleman (who lost his gold-headed cane) in a private house in Paris. The boys were apprehended, and this Conde, though only fourteen years of age, and lame of one arm, was condemned to the galleys for life. After four or five years he procured a bible, and learned by himself to read; and becoming, through close attention to the scriptures, convinced that his religion was antichristian, he publicly renounced it; and declared and defended his sentiments. Ever since he has continued a steady protestant, humble and modest, with a character irreproachable and exemplary, respected and esteemed by his officers and fellow prisoners. I brought away with me some musical pipes of his turning and tuning. He was in the galley appropriated to the infirm and aged; and these, besides the usual allowance of bread, have an additional allowance from the king of nine sous (4½d.) a day.†

* This house will spoil the beauty of the square.

† I was informed by a very respectable person at Marseilles, that the brother of an ancient lady in his family was, several years ago, apprehended by some dragoons, as he was coming from a conventicle or protestant meeting; that his son saw him taken, and immediately went to the governor and offered himself instead of his father; and that he was accepted, and sent to the galleys for life; but at the end of ten years obtained his liberty by a lady's intercession; the father having just lived to see his son released.

56 FOREIGN PRISONS &c. Sect. IV.

[Toulon Arsenal Hospital.]

Some of the sick in the Hospital were in irons; but there were marks of attention and humanity towards them, for they lay in separate beds, and the wards were quiet and not dirty. - Englishmen are strictly prohibited from viewing the arsenal: I got, however, admission, and passed some hours there on two several days.

[Marine Hospital.]

In going over the wards of the marine Hospital I observed nothing remarkable. Its situation in a populous part of the city is very improper. The want of a free circulation of air must produce contagious disorders among the patients; and this will expose the surrounding inhabitants to great danger.

[Portman Castle Prison.]

I lay a few nights in the old castle of Portman, in the isle of Port Crosce, and found there an ancient prison. The descent is by a ladder, through a stone aperture of four feet diameter; which, after the ladder is removed and the hole covered, is a secure, but dreadful, place of confinement. As this is a prison similar to many in castles, in the barbarous ages, when security only was regarded, a drawing of it may not be unacceptable to some of my readers. See plates xv. xvi.

ITALY.

[Nice.]

The Prison at Nice has three stories, with four or five good rooms on each floor, which open into a gallery eight feet wide. The keeper has a neat room or two for the better sort of debtors. Irons are never used except when prisoners are riotous or unruly; and when this happens they are chained to the wall. Their beds have mattresses and blankets. Their allowance is two pounds of bread a day, beside supplies from charitable contributions; of which some came whilst I was in the prison.

There were about two hundred and fifty galley-slaves (so called) in dirty rooms near the water, who were at work in the pontons for clearing the harbour. Their bread was good, of which they had a daily allowance of two pounds, besides four ounces of dried beans, without salt. They have also seven allowed them in money, on the days they work; but two sous and a half of this sum are deducted for supplying them with soup. Sundays and Thursdays are idle days with them, and then they are allowed only the two pounds of bread.* It may not be improper to add, that as the term of their confinement draws towards a conclusion, their slavery is relaxed, and some liberties are granted them.

[Savona Hospital.]

At the Hospital of Savona, as the old surgeon went over the wards with me, he observed how improper it was not to separate chirurgical from other patients; or to suffer, as often happens, a person with a fractured bone, to lie with a person in a fever (though

* I generally weigh several loaves of the bread with my own steel-yard, before I note it down. This hint I give to prevent mistakes, because I found, that at Nice, what they called the pound is but eleven ounces English, and at the galleys at Toulon, two pounds are but one pound and three quarters.

in separate beds) on each side of him. He also condemned the unwholesome and dirty custom which prevails in hospitals, of spitting on the walls and floors.* I was pleased to find an alcove recess, concealed by linen curtains, between each of the beds in the women's ward.

[Genoa.]

In visiting the hospitals at Genoa in February 1736, I observed that L'Albergo del Povero, having high rocks on each side of it, is badly situated.

[Great Hospital.]

The Great Hospital has convenient recesses, concealed by white curtains. A very large convent, in which only ten friars reside, covers a great part of this hospital; and, I apprehend, annually occasions the death of a number of patients double to that of friars in the convent. - The benefactors to this hospital are distinguished by the different postures and attitudes in which their statues are placed, in the wards, and on the staircase, according to the different sums which they have contributed. Many are placed standing; but an hundred thousand crowns entitles to a chair. I observed a statue which had one of the feet under the chair; and was told that the reason was, that the benefactor honoured by it had contributed only ninety thousand crowns. The statues in the wards are now injurious by harbouring dust.† From a regard to the health of patients, I wish to see plain white walls in hospitals, and no article of ornamental furniture introduced.

[Leghorn.]

At Leghorn, I observed in February 1786, in the Prison for the Slaves and their infirmary, and in the City Hospital, the same order and humane attention, that I had observed in my former visit. To the hospital a new spacious ward has been added.

[Pisa.]

In the Hospital at Pisa, the attention paid to the sick, especially in the clean and elegant ward for women, was very pleasing; and must conduce much to the health of the patients, and to promote (particularly in young persons) humane dispositions, and a love of cleanliness. This ward is on a ground floor, and has iron-grated doors for the free admission of light and air. It lies just beyond an elegant botanic garden, which, through the iron-grates, affords a pleasant view.

[Florence.]

At Florence, in 1786, in the Prisons and Hospitals which I had seen about seven years before, I found the most pleasing alteration had taken place, in consequence of the great care and attention of the Grand Duke. The prisons were white-washed; debtors were separated from felons; and the number of prisoners was diminished.

[House of Correction.]

A well regulated house of correction has been lately built here; the rules of which the Grand Duke ordered to be copied for me; and his excellent code of criminal laws, which were sent me, evinces his great attention to the happiness of his people.

[Hospital.]

The wards round the garden of the Hospital of San Maria Nova being very properly contrived for promoting the health and spirits of the patients, especially convalescents; I shall

* Patients with coughs should be supplied with such little boxes or basins as are used in Holland, and in some churches, as at Malta &c, I would have snuff and tobacco strictly prohibited in all hospitals and poor-houses, the use of them being idle, dirty, and expensive.

† I was well informed, that some have hurt their families through the ambition of having their statues placed in this hospital.

58 FOREIGN PRISONS &c. Sect. IV.

[Florence.]

give a plan of the garden, and of the women's ward. This will shew the usual form of hospitals in many ROman-Catholic Countries. See plate XVII.

[Rome.]

In the new Prison at Rome, February 1786, the infirmary was clean, and the sick were, as at the time of my former visits, in clean wards, and in separate beds.

In the noble Hospital of San Michaele I passed two mornings, and found it sadly neglected by the cardinal and the inspectors, who never visit it. The present pope's favourite institution is a seminary or school for young women; where neatness, oeconomy and industry must give pleasure to every visitant.

Anatomical lectures are read publicly twice a week in the hospital of S. Gio Laterano; one of which I attended.

[Naples.]

The condition of the Prisons and Hospitals at Naples in 1786, was the same that I had seen it in 1778.

MALTA.

[Malta Prison.]

The Prison at Malta consists of several dirty and offensive rooms in the town-house, where in April 1786, there were nine prisoners. One of them, a Turk, had suffered the torture; in consequence of which a mortification had taken place, and the surgeon was applying the bark internally, and externally: the second time I saw him he was worse; but I did not continue long enough in the island to know the event.

[Slaves.]

The Slaves have many rooms, and each sect their chapels or mosques, and sick rooms apart. A woollen manufactory is carried on by some of them; but the majority are blacks, and unhappy objects. For the religion (the knights so called) being sworn to make perpetual war with the Turks, carry off by piracy many of the peasants, fishermen, or sailors from the Barbary coasts. How dreadful! that those who glory in bearing on their breasts the sign of the Prince of peace, should harbour such malignant dispositions against their fellow creatures, and by their own example encourage piracy in the states of Barbary. Do not these knights by such conduct make themselves the worst enemies to the cross of Christ, under the pretence of friendship?

In this city there are two large hospitals, one for each sex, supported by the knights.

[Hospital for Men.]

The Hospital (de S. Jean de Jerusalem*) for men, is situated near the water. The three principal wards are in the form of a T, which communicate one with another, having an altar in the centre. By additional buildings the ward on one side is made longer than that on the other. Their breadth is thirty-four feet and a half, but the cross ward is only twenty-nine feet and four inches wide. These three wards connected are called the hall.

* The institution of the knights (of Malta) was in the tenth century, at Jerusalem, for the care of the wounded in the Christian wars; they afterwards settled in the isle of Rhodes, but~being driven from thence in 1530, this island of Malta was given them by Charles the fifth, king of Spain and emperor of Germany.

[Plates.]

Sect. IV. MALTA. 59

[Malta Hospital.]

The pavement is of neat marble (or stone) squares. The cieling is lofty; but, being wood, now turned black; the windows being small, and the walls hung round with dusty pictures, this noble hall makes but a gloomy appearance. All the patients lie single. One ward is for patients dangerously sick or dying; another for patients of the middle rank of life; and the third for the lower and poorer sort of patients. In this last ward (which is the largest) there were four rows of beds; in the others, only two. They were all so dirty and offensive as to create the necessity of perfuming them; and yet I observed that the physician, in going his rounds, was obliged to keep his handkerchief to his face. - The use of perfume I always reckon a proof of inattention to cleanliness, and airiness; and this inattention struck me here forcibly on opening some of the private closets, with which this hall is very properly furnished. - There are several other wards, and some single rooms for such of the knights as choose to come here when sick. There is likewise a large apartment in which the governor (always one of the knights) resides during the time of his being governor, which is two years. He has a salary; and is generally, as a sensible gentleman here told me, a young and unexperienced person; others, either not liking the confinement, or being fearful of catching some distemper.

The great hall already mentioned is on the ground floor; and under it is another hall, or rather a large ward, which is nothing but a dark and damp arched cellar. Here were cutaneous patients; also fifty-two old infirm servants from the city, who are maintained by the religion. The first and the under-physician, with the surgeon, a few pupils, and one or two attendants, take the round or walk of the upper wards; but in this ward the first physician does not attend. In the great hall there is a slate fixed on the closet door at the side of the beds of the patients, on which the initial letters of their usual medicines, diet &c. are written. On this slate also one of the pupils always marks the doctor's order, so that, at his next visit, he may see his last prescription. When these gentlemen go their rounds, all the patients are required to be in their beds.

The patients are twice a day, at eight and four, served with provisions; one of the knights, and the under-physician constantly attending in the two halls, and seeing the distribution. From the kitchen (which is darker and more offensive than even the lower hall, to which it adjoins) the broth, rice, soup and vermicelli are brought in dirty kettles first to the upper hall, and there poured into three silver bowls, out of which the patients are served. They who are in the ward for the very sick, and those of the middle rank of life, are served in plates, dishes and spoons of silver; but the other patients (who are far the most numerous) are served in pewter. I objected to the sweet cakes, and two sorts of clammy sweet-meats, which were given to the patients.

The number of patients in this hospital during the time I was at Malta (March 19th to April 19, 1786) was from five hundred and ten, to five hundred and thirty-two. These were served by the most dirty, ragged, unfeeling and inhuman persons I ever saw. I once found eight or nine of them highly entertained with a delirious dying patient. The governor told me they had only twenty-two servants, and that many of them were

60 FOREIGN PRISONS Sect. IV.

[Malta Hospital.]

debtors or criminals, who had fled thither for refuge.* At the same time I observed, that near forty attendants were kept to take care of about twenty-six horses and the same number of mules, in the Grand Master's stables; and that there all was clean. I cannot help adding, that in the centre of each of these stables, there was a fountain out of which water was constantly running into a stone basin; but that in the hospital, though there was indeed a place for a fountain, there was no water.

There is great want of room in this hospital. I requested that a delirious patient who disturbed the other patients, might be lodged in a room by himself; but was told, no such room could be found. Opposite to this hospital there is a large house, which is now used only for a wash-house. A great improvement might be made by providing a wash-house for the hospital some where out of the city (its only proper situation) and appropriating these spacious and airy apartments to poor knights and convalescent patients. The slow hospital fever (the inevitable consequence of closeness, uncleanliness and dirt) prevails here.

At the back of the hall, over the knights' arms (a cross) is a marble crown, and under it on white marble is this inscription,

INFANTIUM INCOLUMITATI.

[Foundling Hospital.]

Here is a wooden cradle, which turning on an axis, the pins strike a bell, to give notice of the reception of infants into the Foundling Hospital. These infants, after being received, are sent to the governess of that hospital, who provides nurses for them in the country; and on the first Sunday in every month, these nurses bring back the children to shew them and at the same time to receive their pay; the governess, very properly, being present. On one of these occasions, I had the pleasure of seeing a number of fine healthy children.

[Hospital for Women.]

In the Hospital for Women there were two hundred and thirty patients, who had all separate beds. The governess attended me through every ward, and was constantly using her smelling bottle; in which she judged very properly, for a more offensive and dirty hospital for women I never visited.†

* Even a murderer," added the commissary, "cannot be taken if found in this hall." Every church in Malta, where the sacrament is administered, is a sanctuary for debtors and felons; in that of the Dominicans, and also of the Augustins there were one or two persons.

† Sir William Hamilton favoured me with a letter to the Grand Mailer, which I presented after my first visit to this great hospital. He very readily and kindly said, that the prisons and hospitals should be all open to me. On a subsequent visit, he asked me what I thought of his hospitals. I faithfully told his Highness my sentiments, and made some of the remarks that I now publish; adding, if he himself would sometimes walk over the hospitals, many abuses would be corrected. But my animadversions were reckoned too free; yet, being encouraged by the satisfaction which the patients seemed to receive from my frequent visits, I continued them; and I have reason to believe they produced an alteration for the better in the state of these hospitals, with respect to cleanliness and attention to the patients.

SECT. IV. TURKEY. 61

[Malta Foundling Hospital.]

In the Foundling Hospital there were thirty-nine girls from seven to about twelve years of age, who were clean both in their persons and dress, but very pale. They have no proper place for exercise, and but two bed-rooms, one of which is close and offensive. A piece of ground, which might contribute to their health by being made a play-ground, is a sort of useless garden.

[Poor Houses.]

Near the city are two Houses for the Poor. In that for men, there were one hundred and forty poor persons, who are lodged in eight or nine rooms in a range, on the ground floor; with a church appropriated to them, and apartments for a chaplain adjoining. Their allowance is a brown loaf (weight exactly 1lb.) some soup, and a little cheese, and on some days, a penny in money; and many of them have a small garden. There being no common hall, or dining-room, every one carries his provision into his bed-room. On the whole, however, these infirm persons are pretty well supplied and accommodated.

In the house for women there were two hundred and thirteen, to whom a kind attention seems to be paid by the governor, who has convenient apartments adjoining.

[Convent.]

Near these poor-houses, there is a particular Convent called Casa della Manrisa founded by a Spanish prince, in which travellers strictly conforming to the rules of the house may lodge and board for forty days, at a small expense. It is a sort of religious retreat, and very pleasant. I here passed some hours two afternoons; and found all still, quiet, and agreeable. The passages, the rooms, and the church were elegantly neat, and perfectly clean. Over the door of each room there was a picture of some person famous for virtue and piety. The windows looked towards the garden. The refectory is a beautiful hall painted with subjects from scripture history. In the church, under the desks of the seats, were boxes with sand which turned on a pivot, to prevent the floor from being soiled. Three priests constantly reside in this pleasant retreat.*

TURKEY.

[Zante.]

At Zante, the Prison consists of two rooms on the ground floor, at the back of the guard-house. There were in May 1786 five or six prisoners, very dirty, yet scarcely distinguished from the tattered Venetian soldiers.†

* Before I leave Malta I would just mention, that the staircase at the Grand Master's palace is the most convenient for infirm persons that I have ever seen; from which hints may be taken for the more easy ascent to the upper wards in our hospitals. It is circular, nine feet and three inches wide, the rises two inches and a half, the steps at the widest end two feet two inches, and at the narrowest nine inches.

† Here is another room used for a prison, adjoining to the health-office, in which was confined the principal pirate concerned in seizing the ship called the Grand Duchess, bound from Leghorn to London. Three volleys of shot having been aimed at him without killing him, he was despatched by a pistol applied to his ear. His head and the heads of his two companions were fixed on poles. The two latter became mere skulls within two months, but his head and even his countenance continue (as I was assured) much the same, though three years have elapsed since his execution.

62 FOREIGN PRISONS &c. Sect. IV.

[Zante.]

The Hospital is a long room, containing fourteen beds, in which were only six patients. Over this room is a sort of foundling-hospital.

In those cities which I have seen in Turkey, the debtors have a prison separate and distinct from the felons. - Without such a separation in England, a thorough reformation of the gaols can never be effected.

[Smyrna Prison for Criminals.]

The Prison for Criminals at Smyrna is situated near the sea, and consists of two rooms and a court. So speedy is the execution of justice here, that I found in this prison no more than seven prisoners at any of the three visits which I made to it in 1786. One of these prisoners having been bastinadoed so that he was swelled from head to foot, I advised him to bathe in the sea, and to apply to the soles of his feet plasters made of salt and vinegar. In the use of these means, with the addition of two doses of Glauber's salts, he recovered; and I acquired a credit which made the keepers, in my subsequent visits, particularly attentive to me.*

[Prison for Debtors.]

The Prison for Debtors consists of four or five rooms, and a court to walk in. In this populous city I found but fourteen prisoners at one time, and at another time, not so many. Their subsistence depends chiefly on charity, and the collections made for them in the Greek and Roman-Catholic churches.

[Hospitals.]

In this city there are several Hospitals. One was lately built by the English Factory, and is designed chiefly for such sailors, as may happen to be ill on their arrival, or to be taken ill during their stay in the harbour. It consists of three rooms on one floor, the largest of which was unfurnished; another had three patients in it; and the third, none. There were besides, two small unfurnished rooms in the back court, intended for persons infected with the plague.†

In a situation almost opposite to this, the gentlemen belonging to the Dutch Factory have also nearly finished an Hospital.The rooms in it are all on the ground floor; and

* One morning I attended the Cadi and other officers of the police when they visited the shops and examined the weights used in them, and the quality of the bread sold by the bakers. All false and light weights they cut and carried away. Such of the shop-keepers as were judged to be delinquents were either sent to prison, or immediately bastinadoed; that is, laid on their backs to receive on the soles of their feet, a number of strokes, at the discretion of the Cadi. I heard of a person who had received four or five hundred of these strokes; but I can hardly suppose it possible to survive a much less number. - Such hasty executions of, what is here called justice, are very improper and cruel. The terror which appeared in the countenances of all the shop-keepers at these times implied, that the innocent as well as the guilty might suffer; and, indeed, it is scarcely possible this should not sometimes happen, the Cadi, who orders and superintends these punishments, continuing in his office only a year, and being generally young and unexperienced.

† As but very few died of the plague in Smyrna in 1786, the houses of the Franks were then all open. These live in a part of the town quite separate from the Turks. In like manner at Constantinople, all the European ambassadors and merchants live by themselves in the suburb of Pera; where, while the plague rages, they shut their houses. All provisions then brought to them are taken at the doors and dipped in water; and all letters are received with a pair of tongs, and fumigated before they are opened.

[Plate 16: Portman Castle.]

Sect. IV. TURKEY. 63

[Smyrna.]

contiguous to it there is a neat and spacious garden with a burying ground in the middle of it.

[Hospitals.]

The Venetian or Italian Hospital consists of several neat and clean rooms. The good prior, having himself formerly been ill of the plague made a vow, in consequence of which he has ever since assiduously attended others in the same circumstances. Thinking him, therefore, though not a physician, a very experienced man, I proposed to him the questions I had prepared about this distemper; and he was so good as to favour me with answers to them.

The French likewise, and the Jews and Greeks have Hospitals here. In one of the Greek hospitals there is a larger and more airy ward or hall than any I saw in Smyrna; and contiguous to it there are several rooms for patients ill of the plague, which are seldom empty. But a new hospital for such patients, near the English burying-ground* is just finished. The plan will shew the form of it. See plate XVIII.†

[Constantinople.]

I found nothing remarkable in the prisons at Constantinople but that they were very still and quiet. I was at a loss to account for this, till I reflected, that the only beverage for the prisoners is water.

In the Prison at Galata,‡ in 1786, there were eighteen debtors. Their subsistence depends partly on collections made for them in churches; but, for this purpose, there is also a bag hung up in the middle of the street which leads to this prison, to receive contributions of bread, meat, &c. from charitable persons.‖ Prisoners of different sects (as Greeks, Jews, Armenians, Turks, &c.) have separate apartments allotted them; and it may be worth mentioning, as a general observation, that I always found fewer prisoners of the Mahometan, than of other religions. - In one of the prisons a superstitious respect is paid to a fine spring of water, because it was found in a place where a church had formerly stood; and the prisoners constantly drink it.

The Prison for the slaves is very large, but it was almost empty, the Captain Bashaw having taken most of the men into his galleys. The few who remained were healthy and a very humane attention was paid to them.

* The English Factory's burying-ground lies open, and is shamefully neglected; many of the tomb-stones being broken down, and others taken away; while an adjoining burying ground is carefully preserved and locked up.

† Here I had an opportunity (which in this tour I did not enjoy at any of the hotels of our Ambassadors) of attending public worship on Sunday, performed by the worthy chaplain to the factory. I take this occasion of mentioning a secret source of contagious irreligion, that most of our ambassadors have no chaplains, nor any religious service in their houses. - With pain I have observed on Sundays many of our young nobility and gentry, who are to fill eminent stations in life, instructed in their houses by example at least (especially in Roman-Catholic countries) to make the Lord's day a season of diversion and amusement. - How have I been mortified by the comparison, when after calling at their hotels, I have seen, upon my return from thence, the chapels of the Spanish and French ambassadors crowded!

‡ Galata and Pera are two of the suburbs of Constantinople.

‖ Into this prison a fine stream of water has been lately brought by a Greek as a testimony of his devotion on the loss of his only son.

64 FOREIGN PRISONS &c. Sect. IV.

[Constantinople.]

I could not gain admittance into the Prison of the seven Towers. Four of these towers have been destroyed by time, and the late fire. The remaining three are very lofty, and stand in the corners of a large area. Through an aperture I had a view of one of the dungeons; and it seemed to be about five feet below the surface of the ground. It happened to be the dungeon to which the Russian ambassador had been lately conveyed; but soon after a better apartment was assigned him.

[Hospitals.]

The only Hospitals of the Franks in this city are those of the French nation. They have one at Galata, and the use there of a garden (belonging to an adjoining convent) which is very convenient for convalescent patients.

Their hospital for infected patients is at Pera, and consists of several rooms, in which I found no patients. The prior constantly resides here, and has three or four neat rooms, which I found so strongly perfumed as to render them, to me, almost as offensive as a foul lazaretto. Here are also several detached rooms, intended for the performance of quarantine, by persons who have been accidentally, or designedly, in infected families or ships.

The Greeks have an Hospital at Galata, where I found the sick lying on the floors, and the prior himself ill of the jaundice, and a dreadful cutaneous disorder. All were neglected; for, as the prior told me, none of the faculty would attend them. I requested a young physician, who accompanied me to this hospital, to set the charitable example.

The Turks have few Hospitals at Constantinople. Those for the sick are a sort of caravansaries, in one of which, I saw many sick and dying objects lying on dirty mats on the floors. The surgeon seemed to be either extremely stupid or intoxicated with opium.

The two Hospitals for Lunatics are admirable structures built entirely of stone and proof against fire. The rooms are all on the ground floor, arched, and very lofty, having opposite windows, and opening under a corridor into a spacious area. The keeper has a room or two in the middle of the area, from whence he has a full view of the entrance, and of all that passes. In the courts there is plenty of water; but yet very little regard appears to be paid to cleanliness: nor is there, in any other respect, much attention shewn to the patients.

[Asylum for Cats.]

In the midst however of this neglect of human beings, I saw an instance of attention to cats, which astonished me; I mean an asylum, which has been provided for them, and which is situated near the mosque of San Sophia.

[Salonica Hospital.]

At SALONICA the Greeks have, in a burying-ground out of the city, an Hospital for infected patients, which is enclosed by high walls, and has an iron door at the entrance. There were four rooms on the ground floor, and over these, a platform for lodging recovering patients. Though quite empty it gave me the same head-achs that I have felt in foul lazarettos.

To this may be contrasted the Hospital of the Jews, situated on a rising ground in the middle of their burying place, some of the tombs serving for tables and seats. It is a sort of spacious shed, divided in the middle by a wall, and the sides supported by pillars. It was lightsome and airy, and better accommodated for its purpose than any I had seen.

[Plate 17: Florence.]

Sect. IV. VENICE. 65

[Salonica.]

Being quite open and without surrounding walls, it would have greatly pleased my much esteemed friend Dr Jebb.*

[Scio Hospital for Lepers.]

The only Hospital I have seen for Lepers is in the island of Scio near the city bearing that name. It contained about one hundred and twenty lepers, consisting of men and women, lodged in separate apartments, in a long range of rooms, elevated above the ground. The situation is airy and pleasant; and most of the lepers are accommodated with little gardens, which supply them with almonds, pot-herbs, and delicious figs and grapes. Water having lately been conducted hither from the mountains in two streams, one supplying those in health, and the other the lepers, I requested the vice consul to propose to the directors to make a farther improvement, by adding two convenient baths, one for each sex.

VENICE

[Venice Prison.]

In the Great Prison at VENICE, the sick are separated from the other prisoners but the rooms assigned them are (very improperly) on the ground floor, and in a close part of the prison.

The Galleys which I saw were clean and not offensive, in consequence of possessing one of the best means of cleanliness, by an easy access to water.

GERMANY.

[Trieste Prisons.]

In the Prison at TRIESTE, Nov 30, 1786, there were thirteen strong rooms arched with brick, with one or two beds in each. The infirmary contained six neat beds. None of the prisoners were in irons, but being constantly confined, their rooms were offensive. Allowance about 2½d. of our money. The keeper observed that the prisoners, in constant confinement, are more healthy on the white bread allowance than on brown: and this may be true if the latter be coarse rye-bread.

The Galley-Slaves (so called) were lodged in a house of correction which was lately a convent; the men below and the women above stairs. The men were in chains, and employed in cleaning the streets, bridges &c. The women were carding, spinning &c.

* "It is the secret but indelible persuasion, that lofty walls and iron doors, and grated windows enclose disease, as well as misery of other kinds, which prevents the exertions of the compassionate from being employed in lessening the calamities of confinement." Dr Jebb's Thoughts on the Construction and Polity of Prisons, vol. II. p. 558. - The mode of enclosure, which he recommends, is by a "dry moat with shelving sides, and a wall rising from the bottom of the moat level with the surface of the soil." p. 560. This mode of constructing prisons would not be secure; and it is in many places impracticable; nor does it appear to be necessary for the health of the prisoners. See some good remarks on this subject in a letter of Dr Percival's in the Gentleman's Magazine, for Sept. 1787, p. 766.

in the house. I saw them at dinner on wholesome bread and soup. They looked healthy; and from the placidness of their countenances, I inferred the humanity of their keeper; and I was a witness of his shewing them an attention which in such houses, is of particular importance.

The Hospital is now converted into barracks for soldiers, the sick being removed to one of the dissolved monasteries, which is finely situated, and has a spacious garden. The rooms are lofty. The bedsteads were of iron, and (very properly) had no testers. The bread was good; but (as is too common in these houses) given the patients on the very day it was baked.

[Vienna Prisons.]

In the Great Prison at Vienna, in December 1786, I found very few of the dungeons empty: some had three prisoners in each dungeon; and three horrid cells I saw crowded with twelve women. All the men live in total darkness, and are not permitted to make any savings from their daily allowance (of four creutzers) for the purpose of procuring light. They are chained to the walls of their cells, though so strong, and so defended by double doors, as to render such a security needless. No priest or clergyman had been near them for eight or nine months; and this is reckoned, even by these criminals, so great a punishment, that they complained to me of it with tears, in the presence of their keepers.

I recollected a dungeon in which, at my former visit, I had seen a prisoner dying; and on mentioning this, one of the turnkeys said, "Yes, he died about a year ago:" which another confirmed. This, however, must have been a different person; for eight years had elapsed since my former visit.

The torture-room lies nine steps deeper than the dungeons; but I will say nothing of this room, nor of the instruments of torture, because the Emperor has shewn his humanity and wisdom by abolishing this shocking practice.

[New Prison.]

All the prisoners in the old prison just mentioned, are to be soon removed into a Prison lately built by the emperor. It consists of forty rooms, and also twenty dungeons at the depth of twenty-two steps below the surface of the ground, boarded with thick planks, in which are strong iron rings, for the purpose of chaining the prisoners. These dungeons are larger, and in other respects (though horrid enough) less horrid than those in the old prison. They were empty, but above them were two hundred and fourteen criminals crowded into a few rooms. Their daily allowance is four creutzers. I was pleased to find here a set of rooms for trying the prisoners.

[Great Casern.]

In a prison for the confinement of convicts, called the Great Casern, there were eighty-six men all in one large room. At the front of this prison, there is a chapel and a guard-room; and at the side of it, a room for searching the prisoners, to prevent their taking with them improper instruments when they come from work. - Their employment is cleaning the streets - Their allowance on idle days (that is, holidays and Sundays) is one creutzer for bread (weight 15 oz.) one for soup, and one for greens: on other days, four creutzers. At night they lie in the large room just mentioned, but in their clothes, and chained to the floor. This room, having no other windows than two holes in the ceiling,

Sect. IV. GERMANY. 67

[Vienna.]

is, even in the day time, offensive beyond expression. Indeed, it would not be wonderful, if the effluvia from these prisoners, while they work in the streets, should spread through this city an infection destructive to the health, and fatal to the lives of the inhabitants.

[Little Casern.]

In the Little Casern (another prison for confining convicts) there were in two rooms forty-two criminals; about a third of whom were at work in one of these rooms, and the rest were idle in the other. Allowance, the same as in the great casern. The guard in the great casern consists of a corporal and six soldiers; in this, of a corporal and four soldiers. These guards will not suffer any thing to be given to the prisoners; and there is likewise in this city, a strict prohibition of giving to vagrants and beggars in the streets.

[House of Correction.]

In the House of Correction, women only are at present confined. Allowance, one pound of bread, and two dishes of different kinds of soup, once a day. Great attention seemed to be paid to the sick. Their rooms were clean, and separated from the other rooms. - Of one hundred and fifty-three prisoners thirty-five were ill; a high proportion, but not higher than might be expected in a prison where no bedding is allowed.

The criminals sent off to Hungary are brought first to this prison. They are clothed in an uniform, and chained in companies, five and five together, with irons round their necks and on their feet; besides a chain about ten inches long between the feet of each of them, and another chain about six feet long for fastening each of them to the persons next to him. - I was told, that the hard work in which they are employed, of drawing boats up the Danube, with their coarse fare, wears them out so fast that few of them live in this state above four years.

[House for Vagrants.]

The House of Correction, in which vagrants chiefly, and a few debtors are confined, was lately a monastery. The rooms and passages are airy and spacious, and the house is well supplied with water by a stream that is constantly running. The debtors and vagrants were confined in separate rooms, but of the former there were only seven. The number of the latter was one hundred and forty-nine; and they were employed in carding, spinning, weaving &c. Count Pergen is here giving an useful example of humanity, and readiness to make improvements. It was owing to his great attention, that I always found this house clean, and in good order. There is an office belonging to it, in which accounts of its state are kept, with much regularity. A paper or journal was given me containing these accounts, divided into eighteen columns, in the following order.

1. Prisoners' names

[Vienna General Hospital.]

The hospital in the suburbs, called the General Hospital, is very large, and contains several courts. Most of the wards are seventeen feet high, sixty-one feet long, and twenty-seven broad; with opposite windows; and twenty beds in every ward, with vacancies between them three feet wide, in which tables were placed. Some of the wards were much larger. - They were all furnished with basins, towels &c. and great attention seemed to be paid to cleanliness. To each ward three nurses are assigned, and a room of a moderate size, with a fire place for washing and other purposes. The roof has windows in it, but unhappily they are glazed; and consequently the free escape of the foul air is prevented, and much evil must be produced.

At the back of this hospital, there are twelve neat rooms, with every thing in them proper for lying-in women - a bed - drawers with white child-bed linen - a toilet - tea things - -and a bed for the nurse. These rooms are for those that pay one florin a day. There are other rooms with five or six beds in each, for such as pay half a florin a day. The former advance at entrance the pay of eight days; and the latter the pay of four days. There are rooms also for those who pay ten creutzers a day. All in this department was clean, calm and quiet. Women are admitted at any hour, through a private door and passage, and no questions are asked at their coming in, or going out.

[Tower For Lunatics.]

The new Tower for Lunatics, near this hospital, has five stories, and twenty-eight rooms on each floor. The doors open into a passage six feet wide, which goes round the building. Though great attention was paid to cleanliness, the passages were very offensive; the form of the building causing the air to stagnate in its centre, as in a deep well.

In the chancery (or accountant's room) the numbers given me, December 13, 1786, were as follows:

In the General Hospital, 389 Men. 424 Women.

Lying-in Hospital, 111 Women. 23 Children.

Lunatic Hospital, 183 Men. 78 Women.

Total 1208

Daily expense for provisions, 141 florins, 56 creutzers and 2 cratz.

[Military Hospital.]

In the Military Hospital, Dec. 14, 1786, there were five hundred and fifty-one patients. The wards are similar to those in the general hospital, and the passages (very properly) eight feet wide. Neither these, nor the patients were so clean as in the former hospital, the attendants being soldiers sent hither by their officers, as a punishment for drunkenness or small offences; and from whole pay (which is five creutzers) three are deducted for their provision. A surgeon of a battalion attending in each room, keeps the wards quiet. There are thirty of these surgeons, of whom fourteen reside, and attend alternately with the others for a fortnight. There is also a superintending surgeon, to whom the other surgeons make reports every day.*

* I have all the plans of the above hospitals; and should any gentlemen wish to inspect them, they are much at their service.

Sect. IV. GERMANY. 69

[Vienna. Convents.]

In the Convent of Les Freres de Charité, the long ward is twenty-five feet and a half wide, and contains one hundred and fourteen beds with green furniture, and (very properly) without testers. All was still and quiet: but in such monastic institutions the wards are always kept too close. This convent has a house belonging to it, properly furnished with beds, cisterns, towels &c. for convalescent patients. It stands out of the city; and the wards front a pleasant garden. The feet of the patients are washed at coming in; and being here well attended and nourished, they generally go out fitted to follow their usual occupations.

In the Convent of St. Elizabeth, there are fifty beds for sick women in one ward, twenty-three feet wide, on the ground floor, with folding doors in the middle to separate the slightly sick from the other patients. About sixteen good sisters carefully attend this convent; but (as usual in convents) it wants a proper circulation of fresh air. The emperor encourages it; and the same is true of the society of the order de S. Johanne de Deo, which, as I learn from the printed lists, has many convents in his dominions and other-parts of Europe.

In this city there are many other noble institutions; which, being the objects of the emperor's particular attention, and having been either founded or improved by him, manifest a public spirit which does him great honour; and gives a striking example to other potentates. Some of these I will just mention.

There is an Hospital for Invalids, which was formerly the house for the poor.

In the present House for the Poor, the aged, the infirm, and incurable are lodged and provided for in separate rooms; and great attention appeared to be paid in it to order and cleanliness.

The Foundling Hospital was lately a convent. It has partitions* between the rooms, but no doors. The windows and apertures near the ceilings and floors are so contrived as to keep the rooms fresh, and free from offensive scents. - There were here above eighty infants, to every two of whom, while they are in the house, a nurse is assigned; but they are not continued long here, much the greater part being kept constantly under the care of nurses in the country, whose pay for children under one year old is two florins and thirty creutzers: for children from one to ten, two florins: but from ten to fifteen, only one florin per month,† - The whole number of children supported by this hospital was in December 1786, one thousand one hundred and eighty-nine. No child is admitted without some pay. Twenty-four florins will procure admission for any child under the age of a year. If the parents are poor, and produce a certificate from the minister of the parish, only twelve florins are required; which sum must be paid by the parish, if there are no parents, and the child has been taken up in the street.

* Such reparations by partition are proper in all large houses of correction or industry. They render those houses more quiet. They make a proper reparation more easy, according to the different kinds of work in which persons are employed. And they enable overseers to make their visits more unexpectedly.

† A florin is sixty creutzers, or about 2 of our money.

[Vienna Orphan Hospital.]

In the Orphan Hospital, there are three large rooms for each sex. The dormitories are twenty-nine feet wide, and the passages into which they open eight feet and a half These passages I observed to be furnished with proper washing-places for the children. The beds are placed six feet from the wall, that the governor (as he told me) may see that all is clean. The mattresses, being of straw, are changed every three months; and the children have clean linen given them once a week in winter, and twice in summer. The great attention in this hospital to cleanliness and air makes the proportion of sick in it very small.

Here is a new institution of the emperor's for the support and instruction of the deaf and dumb, under the care of a clergyman. The boys were clothed in dark grey, and the girls in green. Some were winding silk - spinning - weaving &c. And others were employed in a printing-office. One day in a week is appointed for a public inspection of them. The clergyman proposes by signs questions to them, and they write their answers on a large slate provided for that purpose.*

[Vienna.]

Here is also a house where persons who are out of employment may find work.* I saw, in a large room, many cheerfully carding and spinning. But the number of persons thus provided for (six hundred and fifty-five) being greater than could be conveniently employed in the house, most of them were allowed to carry the materials for their work to their own houses.

I took the liberty of mentioning several of these remarks on the prisons and hospitals at Vienna, to the emperor, when he did me the honour of giving me a private audience; and he has relieved the miseries of many unhappy sufferers.

There is in this city a fixed price for meat, as well as an assize for bread and flour. - The butchery is, with the utmost propriety, carried on in the suburbs, and the meat is prepared for sale there, before it is brought to the public markets. The same order is observed in all the other cities of the empire; and this may be one reason why I never saw, in any city on the continent, an over-driven ox.

[Francfort House of Correction.]

At Francfort, the House of Correction and the House for the Poor join, and are under one direction. The porous stone on which the men are employed in these houses, is brought from the banks of the Rhine. They beat it with wooden pestles in a large stone trough bound with iron; and the powder, mixed with lime, makes a cement impenetrable by moisture, and as hard as stone. This is sent to Holland, and many other parts of Europe. The women do the laborious work in the apartments for the poor. In January 1787, there were here fifty men, thirty-five women, sixty-four boys, sixty-one girls, twelve prisoners, seventeen vagrants; in all two hundred and thirty-nine. The house, though old, was clean. Half of Saturday in every week is appropriated to the business of cleaning the apartments. It has a chapel, and a room in which the governors meet twice a week. It is inspected also by the ladies; and the regulations of it are published. The allowance of provisions is good bread and beer, soup twice a week, and meat on Sundays and Wednesdays.†

[Asylum for Lunatics.]

The Asylum for Lunatics, built in 1783, is worthy of observation. The master's apartment, the kitchen, and offices are on the ground floor. On this and the second floor there are several rooms (fourteen feet by twelve and a half, and about twelve high) with one, two, or three beds. The passages are only five feet and a half wide, but the landing place in the centre of the house, being twenty-seven feet wide, with four windows, gives light and air to the whole.‡ An aperture always open in each window, added to the quietness

* This is a necessary institution in a city where beggars and vagrants are prohibited.

† In this, and in all poor-houses, and houses of correction, there should be a convenient bath for each sex, and every room should be lime-whited once a year, and the tables, chairs, and other wooden utensils constantly washed. Some may think this an excess of cleanliness; but I would, with Dr. Lind (physician to the royal hospital at Haslar) infist on "an exact neatness and constant cleanliness."

‡ In this house, as in many public institutions, too little attention has been paid to the sewers. - The vaults, even here, were very offensive.

72 FOREIGN PRISONS &c. Sect. IV.

[Francfort.]

and cleanliness of this house, would be a great advantage to it, and probably hasten the recovery of the patients. Here is a large and neat Lutheran chapel, in which the governors, the public, and the insane have separate seats assigned to them; and the last are so placed as to be concealed from the audience during divine service, and in coming in and going out.

[Nassau Castle.]

At a little distance from Nassau, on the other side of the river, there is a ruinous castle which was formerly the residence of the princes of Nassau, who are now branched into several families. There are still remaining two or three dungeons of the prison in the tower, which must have been dark and dreadful places, having only one small aperture for air, and the descent to them by ropes or ladders. I omit the dimensions, as I have given the plan of a similar one at Port-Crosce (see plate XVI.) and shall take occasion to mention one or two in England.

[Aix-la-Chapelle.]

I have observed in my State of the Prisons, p. 137, that the mode of execution at Aix-la-Chapelle for citizens, is by decollation with a broad sword. It may not be improper to add, that it is concealed from the view of the public by a scaffolding round the spot where it is performed.

HOLLAND.

[Bois Le Duc.]

At Bois le Due, the prisoners convicted of small offences are sent to the spin-house at Breda, described in the State of Prisons, p. 51.

[Amsterdam Stadt-House.]

In the Stadt-house at Amsterdam, December 1785, there were seventeen debtors; and January 24, 1787, there were nineteen. - No inhabitant of Amsterdam can be arrested for debt without being three times summoned, with the interval of a fortnight between each citation: nor can any arrest of person, or any execution, take place, till six weeks after the last summons. There is, however, an exception to this rule in cases of accepted bills of exchange, and when the debt is owing to a sentence of a court of justice for damages, and also when the debt is a rent payable on the first of May and November. In the two first of these cases, only one summons is necessary; and in the last, the three may take place in one day, and execution immediately follow. Strangers may at any time be arrested, upon the plaintiff's swearing to the debt before the hooft officier (or sheriff) who gives an order periculo petentis, to arrest the person of the debtor if he can be found in the street; for his own apartment in a private house is sacred, and cannot be forcibly entered, except by a deputation of the magistracy, called here the vollen gerecht, which consists of the hooft officier, two scheepens, their secretary, a messenger and constables. In a public house less ceremony is used; though if a landlord were to refuse admittance, it is doubtful whether even here the officers could force an entry. - A man standing on his steps on the outside of his door, may deride the officers who are patrolling before it, but who dare not touch him, while he stands upon his own premises. -

Sect. IV. HOLLAND. 73

In Holland, burghers of established character, to whom the name of peace-makers is given, are chosen to determine any claims where the sum does not exceed two hundred guilders (about £18).

[Harlem.]

At several doors in Harlem I observed a small board put up with lace upon it, to shew that the mistress of the house was lying-in; and I was informed, that a disturbance near a house, thus guarded, would be severely punished, and that the husband could not at that time be arrested for debt.

[Amsterdam Rasp-house.]

In the Rasp-house, I found one day that all the prisoners had finished their task before three o'clock, and on inquiring if they might not by continuing their work earn somewhat for themselves; one of them very pertinently replied; "No Sir; for I doubt if we had that permission, whether we should be so healthy as we are. The closeness of the court in which we work, situated in the middle of the city, and the scantiness of our provisions, may make relaxation necessary." The number of prisoners in December 1785, was sixty-five; in January 1787, fifty-seven.

[New Work-house.]

At the new Work-house, over one of the outer gates, there is a device, with an inscription to this purpose.

Fear not: I mean not vengeance, but your reformation.

Severe is my hand, but benevolent my intention.

The two rooms for the regents, and two for the governesses, at the front of the house, were very elegant and clean. In January 1787, there were three hundred and fifty persons spinning in one long room. Some here, as in the old work-house,* were employed in boiling ropes and cables, and preparing them for oakum. - The women from the spin-house are removed hither, and I found the same order and quietness here that I had formerly observed in that house. Forty women were at needle-work, and the mother presiding in the midst of them. - All the dormitories, except those for the criminals, were crowded with beds, each of which has a wooden partition.† In the infirmary the patients and rooms were so very dirty, that I did not wonder that persons are not readily admitted to inspect them. A great degree of inhumanity, and abuse of trust, must be imputed to the resident governor.

In the eight years preceding 1783, only five criminals had been executed in this city.‡

From that time to January 1787, there had been only one criminal executed, and he was broken on the wheel.‖ The solemnity with which executions are performed may be

* The old work-house is now converted into a new marine school, in which were a hundred fine healthy boys. In the court there is a large model of a man of war.

† Beds of this kind are still more improper in hospitals, as they are generally small, and cramp the patients; they also harbour vermin - prevent the free circulation of air - and in many circumstances are inconvenient to the patients and their attendants.

‡ See State of Prisons, p. 56.

‖ In Holland, there is no such thing as what is called in England king's evidence; nor can any, except the stadtholder, promise impunity to one who discovers his accomplices. Nor is there any punishment to prisoners for an escape; though others, who break open a prison, are punishable with death.

74 FOREIGN PRISONS &c. Sect. IV,

[Amsterdam.]

one reason of their being so rare. I cannot help adding, that probably it is also in some measure owing to the solemnity of the administration of oaths, that perjury is not so frequent here as in some other countries.* - I could wish, from the clearest principles of reason and sound policy, that the use of oaths, in almost all cases were abolished; and that the affirmation of die fact should be sufficient; and that he who asserted or affirmed a falsity, should be punished and disgraced as a perjurer.

[Utrecht Spin-house.]

In the Spin-house at Utrecht I found no alteration, except that the house was cleaner, in consequence of the discharge of a negligent and wicked keeper.

There had been no execution for the city, or province, for twenty-four years preceding. January 1787.†

* The oath administered in Holland to those of the Jewish religion is expressed in the following words. "You swear by the Almighty and living God, who created heaven and earth, and gave his laws by Moses, that you will be upright and true in whatever shall here be asked of, or proposed to you; and if you declare any thing either entirely, or in part, false and unjust, you acknowledge yourself liable to all the curses, plagues and punishments, temporal and eternal, which the God of Israel inflicted on Sodom and Gomorrah, and on Korah, Dathan and Abiram, and which he has denounced against all those who use or invoke his name falsely, and in vain. As you are true or false, so may God Almighty and Omniscient, reward or punish you."

† The house of Dr. Brown, the worthy minister of the English church at Utrecht, having been lately burnt down during the service on a sunday; I asked him, whether such confusion and rapine took place there, as are usual in such cases in London: and he assured me, that on the contrary, the exactest order was observed, and that every thing was returned him which was taken out of his house.

The regulations with respect to fires are as follows. On the tower of the city, a watchman is constantly stationed, who is to look out every half hour; and if all be well, he is to play a tune on his trumpet; but if a fire appear, he is to blow an alarm, to ring a bell, and hang out a light pointed to that quarter where the fire is seen. The surrounding watchmen, thus alarmed, are immediately to alarm those nearest to them, and those others, till all the watchmen are alarmed; one of whom in each division is to call up the people (of whom and of the officer of the trained bands he has always a list) belonging to the fire-engine in his division, who are to convey it to the spot where the fire has broken out, and to receive a suitable reward according as their engine is the first, second, or third that arrives. This watchman is also to call up the officers and men of the trained bands of his division, who, together with the trained bands in the other divisions, the company on guard, and the burghers of the next division, are to surround the house on fire, and not to suffer any persons to approach it except those belonging to the engines, known by a token given them. The officers of the trained bands and those belonging to the engines are liable to heavy fines, if they do not make an immediate appearance upon the alarm; unless they can prove that the watchman, whose duty it was to alarm them, omitted it; in which case, he is obliged to pay the fine himself. All the houses in the neighbourhood are obliged to set lights in their windows, and to receive whatever goods shall be carried to them.

Sect. V. SCOTLAND. 75

SECTION V.

SCOTCH PRISONS AND HOSPITALS.

[Ayr.]

On my coming into Scotland in July 1787, the first county gaol I visited was at Ayr. There is no court, so that debtors and felons are never out of their rooms.

[Glasgow.]

There is the same defect in the Tolbooth at Glasgow. As the transports continue long in confinement, some alteration was making, by arching the rooms, in order to obtain greater security against escapes and disturbances.

Several of the transports were removed to a new adjoining to the poor-house. Each had a separate room (about six feet and a half by six). The rooms here not being very strong, the prisoners had chains on their feet and necks. The passage being only two feet eight inches wide, most of the rooms were very offensive, and some very damp. - No endeavours are used to reclaim these unhappy objects; whose long confinement, together with the great severity of their chains, and their scanty food (being only two pennyworth of bread in a day) must reduce them to the extremity of misery and desperation.

[House of Correction.]

The House of Correction is under the infirmary for the soldiers. Beside the keeper's apartment, there is only one room, which is neither cieled nor white-washed. The women are entitled to whatever they can earn by their labour, and there were eleven of them spinning. But on Sundays, having no allowance or religious service, as the keeper informed me, they lie in bed.

[Paisley Tolbooth.]

The Tolbooth is in the Tower, has no apartments for the keeper, no court, no water, no sewers, and seems as if it was never white-washed: allowance to prisoners 4d. a day.

1787, Aug. 3, Prisoners 4.*

[Edinburgh.]

In my former publication, I gave but a short account of the prisons at Edinburgh, because I then hoped from the spirited exertions of Mr. Steuart the late provost, that a new gaol would soon be built; but I am sorry to find his designs have been frustrated.

* I would not forget the favour the magistrates did me in presenting me with the freedom of the city, and so politely accompanying me to the poor-house; and in their readiness to make any alteration for the benefit of their fellow creatures. Yet, as several of the girls here, and at the poor-house in Glasgow, were employed in tambour work; I shall beg leave to observe, that the employment of poor children in ornamental work ought never to be the general mode; since if they are afterwards to come out into the world as common servants, or the wives of the labouring poor, it will be found that a readiness in the ordinary and coarser kinds of female work, would have been of much greater service than the acquirement of arts which they have no time or occasion to practise.

76 SCOTLAND. Sect. V.

[Edinburgh.]

I freely related my remarks to the Lord Provost, - that the Tolbooth stood in the same improper place - that it had no court, and was not white-washed - that the gaoler had no apartment in the prison - that he was suffered to sell spirituous and other liquors,* - and to serve the prisoners with their allowance of bread† - that his fees were high,‡ - and that he had no salary.‖

[House of Correction.]

I added, that in the House Correction there were forty-seven women¶ in three close rooms, some of them lying sick;** that no magistrate ever looked in upon them, and that no clergyman ever attended them, or used any endeavours to reclaim them. He replied, "they were so hardened it could have no effect." I differed in my opinion from his Lordship, and told him, that on seriously converting a few minutes with several of them, I saw the tears in their eyes. - I further took the liberty to observe, that the splendid improvements carrying on in their places of entertainment, streets, squares, bridges, and the like, seemed to occupy all the attention of the gentlemen in office, to the total neglect of this essential branch of the police:

* Whiskey is sold in the tolbooth at three-pence a gill; porter three-pence halfpenny a bottle; small beer one penny a bottle. - Garnish is paid by every civil debtor, viz. for oil to lamps two-pence; a pint and a half of whiskey English measure one shilling and six-pence.

† The prisoners at the tolbooth are served with halfpenny rolls. Aug. 5, 1787, weight, of the whitest, 4oz. common sort, 6oz. The rolls in the city weighed rather more, were better baked, and three sold for 1¾d. Some of the transports have been here upwards of two years: their allowance is eight halfpenny rolls a day, or threepence in money. One Thomas Gordon, who was respited, has been in this prison five years and ten months. I was informed, that not long since, a poor wretch under sentence of death was respited during his majesty's pleasure; but after sixteen months, he was brought out and executed.

‡ For the release of one woman in Aug. 1787, whose debt was only 6s. 6d. the following demands were paid,

£. S. D.

For Prison dues (thirty-seven nights) - 1 0 5

Relief money of 6s. 6d. - 0 0 1½

Servants - 0 0 8

Clerk - 0 0 8

1 1 10½

In Feb. 1787, from a debtor confined only two days, the fees demanded were £17: 6: 5½; which being paid under protest, and complaint brought by petition before the sheriff, after considerable expense, and three months attendance, the money was returned.

‖ In every view salaries would be proper; and the keeper, clerks, and other servants would prefer them to their uncertain perquisites. In Feb. 1785, Thomas Dallas, a prisoner, presented a petition to the of of Council and Session, complaining of fees. The keeper in his answer uses these words: "He dedicates his whole time to the duties of his office, and that was meant to yield an independent subsistence for him, although by his appointment to the office he is burdened with annuities and unavoidable expenses to the amount of about £70 sterling, yearly."

¶ Several of the women had been there upwards of a year, and knew not the term of their confinement. There was no separation between those who had been frequently committed, and those who had never before been in prison.

** Two of these very sick women were afterwards removed from their room, which was dirty and offensive, (about twelve feet by six) into a spacious room in the poor-house, and by kind attention were soon in a way of recovery.

Sect. V. SCOTLAND. 77

[Edinburgh.]

for though, as a private person, I might not expect their regard to the remarks I had made in my repeated visits and publications; yet, I hoped they would have paid some deference to the opinion of the legislature, expressed in the humane and salutary clauses of the late acts of parliament; which, from the unaltered state of the prisons of this city, they seemed entirely to have disregarded.

In the State of the Prisons published in 1784, is inserted an account of the number of prisoners convicted of capital crimes in Scotland from 1768 to 1782. I shall give, at the end of the book, a list of the persons adjudged to capital punishments from 1st of January 1783, to 20th of August 1787, as taken from the records. (See Table, No. 1.)

[Infirmary.]

I frequently visited the Royal Infirmary, and could not but observe the want of a dietary in the wards, and that the patients are prohibited the use of those convenient baths that are in this hospital. The brick floors, which are general here, appear to me improper; as, by their hiding the dirt, they may prevent a due regard to cleanliness; and the many interstices afford a lodgment for filth, which is not easily got out from them.

[Orphan Hospital.]

The Orphan Hospital is in a flourishing condition. Two wings are now added, by the generous contribution of Mr. Tod, the Treasurer; who abates not in his assiduous attention.

[Work-house.]

I made several visits to the Charity Work-house, and found it clean, and a proper attention paid to the numerous inhabitants (584). When I was here four years ago, the house was in debt £2000, which is now increased to £4000. This is owing (except £1000 to Sir William Forbes and Co.) to the meal-men, butchers &c; so that instead of five per cent, interest, they probably pay fifteen or twenty. A proper representation of the state of the house was made to the magistrates in February 1787, by six of the gentlemen managers, who had attentively examined the funds of the house; and they declared, that unless an effectual supply were provided, they were resolved to resign their charge.

There are many other charitable institutions in this city, which I omit to mention; but I shall take some notice of the neat, quiet, and comfortable retreat for old people; which has this inscription over the gate.

[Hospital for Old People.]

"When this fabric was built is uncertain, but in the year 1567 it was made an Hospital for old People. - The fabric became in a great measure ruinous, and some parts of it uninhabitable. In the year 1726 the reparations were begun, and fifteen new rooms added by charitable donations - which will be supplied by old persons as the revenue is increased by donations. - £300 sterling entitles the donor to a presentation of a burgess, widow of a burgess, or child of a burgess, male or female. And £350 sterling gives the donor a right to present any person whatsoever, not married, nor under fifty years of age."

In this hospital, each person has his own room, eleven feet by eight and a half, in which is a cupboard and window. These rooms open into a passage twelve feet and a half wide, at the end of which is a sitting room, for such as choose to associate together. A chaplain reads prayers morning and evening. There is a garden, and other conveniences. They have roast meat three times a week, and boiled three times, and eleven bottles of good beer;

coals, clothes and linen are also provided; but the allowance for washing is only sixpence a month. The circumstance of each person's having a window at command was very agreeable to me, as I have often observed, and lately at Norwich hospital for old people, where many lodge in the same room, that the infirmity, or peevishness of one person, has been the cause of half stifling the rest, for want of the admission of (that cordial of life) air.

[Haddington.]

HADDINGTON County Gaol. There are three rooms above stairs for debtors, one called the burgesses' room, and four on the ground floor, for criminals. Dirty and never white-washed: no court: no water. In this and most of the prisons in Scotland the gaolers have no apartments.

1787, Aug. 16, one Debtor and one Criminal.

[Dunbar.]

DUNBAR. In the Prison here, are two large rooms above for debtors, and one dark room below (called thieves hole) for criminals. No court: no water.

1787, Aug. 16, two Debtors, who were alimented at eight-pence a day each.

SECTION VI.

IRISH PRISONS AND HOSPITALS.

[Dublin.]

In 1787 and 1788, I visited the Prisons in Dublin, and all the County Gaols in Ireland; and had the pleasure to find that, in many places, gentlemen were attentive to this important part of the police. The grand juries have granted very liberal preferments, for the purpose of repairing or rebuilding their gaols, and for supplying prisoners with necessaries in sickness and health. On seeing gentlemen so liberal and benevolent, I could not but reflect with great concern, that many of the prisons now building will be monuments of the unskilfulness of the architects, who are ignorant of what constitutes a secure and healthy prison.

The new gaols, having pompous fronts, appear like palaces to the lower class of people in Ireland; and some persons object against them on this account, especially those who are obliged to contribute towards their expense, and think it would be better if they were less commodious; but if strict regulations were observed, and an act passed, absolutely prohibiting beer, as well as all sorts of spirituous liquors, from coming into a prison; and excluding visitants, except a few, and those at fixed times: then, there would be no danger of these gaols appearing too agreeable abodes; and the fear of such restraints would have a good tendency to prevent crimes; or the restraints themselves might be the means of reformation.*

I shall not enlarge in my description of the county gaols, as an Inspector-general of the prisons in Ireland is appointed,† who is to make his report at the beginning of every

session.* Yet I would just mention some defects, which will be obvious to the grand juries, if the judges in their charges insist on their visiting those county gaols. - In every prison there should be a room appropriated to the magistrates, where they may hold their adjourned sessions, or meet to redress grievances. Their presence would, in a great measure, prevent improprieties, and promote order and regularity in those places.

[Newgate.]

At DUBLIN Newgate, there are no proper drains, no baths, no apartments for the gaoler. - Many of the women lay on flag-stones, with a very little straw worn to dust. - On the men's side, several boys, from nine to twelve years of age, were confined with the most daring offenders. - There are many instances of persons dying by intoxication and fighting: one lay dead when I was in the infirmary, and another was killed a few days after.† But the magistrates having determined to make an alteration in this prison, I doubt not but a proper separation of prisoners, and an obligation on the keeper to reside in the prison, will prevent many irregularities; especially as they now have the constant assistance of a worthy and attentive clergyman. At my last visit, there was plenty of water in both the courts, and the women's court was paved.

Though in Sect. xxiv. ducking-stools are mentioned, and a large bath in the middle of the yard was designed for that purpose, yet I hope that this dangerous kind of severity, to young women, will not be used.

* His first report was very full, and laid open many scenes of exaction, abuse and cruelty, which were partly owing to the magistrates' negligence and inattention to their duty.

† I have good authority to assert, that in this prison a puncheon of whiskey has been drunk in a week. - Garnish is not abolished; and prisoners will sell their bread at any price to procure spirituous liquors.

‡ It is a great defeat in the police of this country that there are no proper places for the commitment and punishment of petty offenders: for the gaols, where there is neither solitary confinement, nor employment, and where frequent scenes of riot and drunkenness occur, as in most counties, are very unfit places for the correction of morals. Yet here persons sentenced at the assize for a fortnight's confinement, or for a trifling fine, are often detained till the next assize, through incapacity of paying the fees.

[Dublin House of Industry.]

I found the House of Industry, as formerly, very clean and orderly, and the governors, with unabated assiduity and zeal, attending to this useful and humane institution. The bread and other provisions were very good. The governors have wisely adopted the Dutch mode of devoting the whole of Saturday to cleanliness, such as washing all the rooms, tables, forms, children &c. This is not only conducive to the health of the residents, but will promote in them habits of cleanliness.

The number in this house May 31, 1787, was 1375, and March 24, 1788, was 1627.

[Four-Court Marshalsea.]

FOUR-COURT MARSHALSEA Prison. The lower rooms very dirty; - never white-washed. - Six or eight in a room (about fourteen feet by thirteen). Each pays a penny a night; - above stairs fifteen-pence a week; - for an entire room, five shillings a week; except one room (thirteen feet and a half by ten and a half) the pay for which is 3s. 9½d.

All are without furniture. The rooms are crowded with wives (or reputed wives) children, dogs &c. In most of the lower rooms, the debtors fell whiskey;* one is a pawn-broker's shop. - On the night preceding one of my visits, many had been gambling, drinking, and fighting. The committee of the House of Commons reported March 12, 1787, that "this prison appears a scene of disorder, irregularity, and intoxication."†

[City Marshalsea.]

CITY MARSHALSEA Prison. An old building, dirty, and not white-washed. Here also there had been a scene of confusion and riot the night before, which had brought hither the sheriff, with the city guard, who conveyed three of the prisoners to Newgate. The wives and children of the debtors, living with them, bring in spirits, and this makes most of the lower rooms gin shops:‡ to which may be added, that the prisoners themselves are quite idle and unemployed. The garnish is two bottles of whiskey. Here were persons confined who had large families, whose debts and costs were under ten

* Mr. Dexter the marshal told me, he was well assured from the best information, that when his prison was full, a hogshead of whiskey had been sold in a week, in a clandestine manner, beside what was sold from his own tap.

† It may be thought severe and cruel, especially to debtors, who are not delinquents, that no liquors should be admitted into prisons. But, though the greatest tenderness should be shewn to such unfortunate persons, yet the restraint appears necessary; for many sober persons coming into prison, from uneasiness of mind, and the influence of bad examples, have acquired those habits which ended in their ruin: and the quiet and orderly frequently complain of being disturbed by the noisy and quarrelsome. It appears therefore absolutely necessary, that a new body of rules and orders be fixed by parliament, for the government of debtors, as well as felons, in all prisons. And that not even felons, much less debtors, should be left to the capricious mandates of an insulting gaoler or his turnkeys.

‡ Dr. Scott, physician to the marshalseas, informed me in June 1787, that he had just lost three men out of four, by excessive drinking, in the city marshalsea. They had one morning drunk twelve shillings worth of brandy in punch, beside porter and other liquors.

I shall also give a Sketch of the state of some of the Infirmaries or Hospitals in Ireland.

[Mercers' Hospital.]

Mercers' Hospital, in the middle of the city, was a few year's since very dirty, offensive and unhealthy; but now it is one of the cleanest in Dublin. The wire-lattice in the windows of the wards and passages is an improvement. The tellers of the beds are harbours for dust. Apertures in the wards (as in the infirmary at Leeds) and more frequent white-washing would contribute to the recovery of the patients.

[Stephens's Hospital.]

In Stephens's Hospital the wards are close and offensive; the windows were shut when the days were fine. The indiscriminate admission of visitants is highly improper, especially of men into the women's wards, and more particularly, where the beds, as here, are enclosed with wood and curtains.†

I have seen a person come for admission to this hospital, when the effects of the frequent use of spirituous liquors have appeared by the dropsical water forcing itself through the pores of his skin.‡

* Many persons in this city, in order to have the benefit of an insolvent act, come to prison under friendly actions, and having brought friends, who give the keepers security for the debts, are not confined: yet, after an insolvent act, the keepers make their return on oath that such persons are in actual custody.

† All hospitals should have set days for visitants, and only two in a week (as at the Royal Hospitals at Plymouth and Gosport): the nurse, and proper persons, should always be present to preserve order and quietness. The regulations should be put up in every ward, and the nurses immediately discharged for any neglect, or impropriety.

‡ In almost every village in Ireland, there are several public houses for the sale of spirituous liquors; and when gentlemen, from a regard to the morals and health of their domestics and tenants, have applied to prevent licenses to such houses, the publicans have obtained them from the commissioners of excise in Dublin, because the means of increasing the revenue.

On a resolution at a vestry-meeting in the vestry-room of St. Mary's Dublin, April 2, 1788, to wait on the Lord Lieutenant, the gentlemen stated, "That, upon a most accurate inquiry, it appears that dram-shops amount to a number alarming to humanity; there being in the parish in which they were assembled above one seventh of the total number of houses; in St. Werburgh's no fewer in proportion; in St. Mark's one fifth; and in St James's one fourth of the whole." - In Dr. Aikin's Remarks on the different success, with respect to health, of some attempts to pass the winter in high northern latitudes, in the Memoirs of the Literary emd Philosophical Society of Manchester, vol. /I pag. 89. having related several accounts, he thus observes as to the important article of their drink: "It appears, that in all the unsuccessful instances, vinous and spirituous liquors were used, and probably in considerable quantities. Thus, in one of the Dutch journals, notice is taken, that an allowance of brandy begun to be served to each man as soon as the middle of September. Writers on the scurvy seem, almost unanimously, to consider a portion of these liquors as an useful addition to"

82 IRELAND. Sect. VI.

[Simpson's Hospital.]

Simpson's Hospital for the blind and gouty, is excellent institution. The rooms are neat and clean; and the committee board is well attended. The patients are kindly supplied with newspapers for their amusement; but are, improperly, indulged in the idle habit of taking tobacco and snuff, each having an allowance of four-pence a week for that purpose. The kitchen and offices being, improperly, under ground, were dark and not clean. The greatest attention to cleanliness is the more necessary where offices are under ground.

[St. Patrick's Hospital.]

In St. Patrick's or Swift's Hospital for Lunatics, the rooms (twelve feet by eight) are lofty, and the passages fourteen feet wide. Yet for such unhappy objects, I would prefer the Dol-huis at Amsterdam, and the Hospital at Constantinople, where the rooms open into corridors and gardens, which is for better than their opening into passages, as here, and in England.

[Lying-in Hospital.]

The Lying-in Hospital is a good institution; the rooms in 1787 were quiet and clean: and in 1788, I found the testers removed, the furniture new, and the greatest attention paid to the patients.

[Foundling Hospital.]

In the Foundling Hospital children are received at all times.* A noble institution, if there were more attention to cleanliness and order. No fixed hours for meals. - The linen brown: - white is more proper in such houses. - On viewing the children in 1787, I soon perceived the effects of the loss of lady Arabella Denny's visits, an excellent lady, who for many years paid great attention to this hospital. - In 1788 I saw many fine children, and the girls were neatly clothed, but several had eruptions on their hands.

"the diet of persons exposed to the causes of this disease; and due deference ought certainly to be paid to their knowledge and experience: but, convinced as I am, that art never made so fatal a present to mankind as the invention of distilling spirituous liquors, and that they are seldom or never a necessary, but almost always a pernicious article in the diet of men in health, I cannot but look with peculiar satisfaction on the confirmation this opinion receives by the events in these narratives."

"The temporary glow and elevation caused by spirituous liquors are, I imagine, very fallacious tokens of their good effects; as they are always succeeded by a greater reverse, and tend rather to consume and exhaust, than to feed and invigorate, the genuine principle of vital energy. Another extremely pernicious effect of these liquors, is, the indolence and stupidity they occasion, rendering men inattentive to their own preservation, and unwilling to use those exertions which are so peculiarly necessary in situations like those described in the foregoing narratives."

* Foundling Hospitals may be considered in two lights; one as charities for the maintenance and education of poor deserted children, who otherwise might fall victims to ill treatment and neglect. The other, as means to prevent child-murder, by providing a refuge against the shame and disgrace attending the discovery of illegitimate pregnancy. For both these purposes it is requisite that admission into such hospitals should be easy; but, particularly for the latter, it is essential that it may be obtained without any form, or delay, and in perfect secrecy. It is another question whether such institutions may not do more harm than good, by encouraging licentiousness; but certainly they cannot prevent the murder of children unless the mothers can get rid of the charge without discovery. Those hospitals, therefore, in which admission is made very difficult, and only to be obtained by powerful interest and recommendation, seem to me absolutely useless, and only to serve as a provision for the boards of gentlemen, or of such as by their connections have no need of public relief!

Sect. VI. IRELAND. 83

[Foundling Hospital.]

There were fifty-six children in the infirmaries. Soap is not here allowed, though absolutely necessary for washing the hands of children, whose parents, being of the lowest class, are in this city generally deficient in cleanliness, and have a tendency to scrophulous disorders.

[Blue-Coat Hospital.]

Blue-Coat Hospital. The magnificent front is almost entirely occupied by the officers and servants of this house, whose apartments extend to the back front, where they have a large garden, in which is a bowling green and walks round it: but the place for the children's diversion is a slip of ground immured with high walls, having in the midst of it an infirmary with six beds. The vault bad. The windows in the passage not capable of being opened. The children have no vegetables of any kind with their food. - By the constant use of meat, they are habituated to a very expensive diet. When I objected to this mode of living, the reply was, "Our children are healthy and well." But they are neither healthier nor finer boys, than those in the Hibernian school, where a very different mode of diet is adopted: for there the extensive garden is appropriated to the cultivation of vegetables for the children.

[Hospital for Incurables.]

Hospital for Incurables. Both outside and inside dirty: - the rooms offensive : - no rules: - no diet table: - the house-keeper in the country; The mistresses of such houses should never be permitted to be absent.

[Military Hospital.]

Military Hospital. I observed in my former publication that the military hospital was an old and incommodious building, and that the patients were almost stifled; but I had the pleasure to find in 1788, that a spacious and airy infirmary, adjoining to the Phoenix Park, was nearly finished; and I hope the fine stream of water will be brought under the building; which, by forcing pumps, may prevent the closets and drains from being offensive, and the baths may then be well supplied in a receiving room, for washing the patients on their admission, similar to the practice in the royal hospitals at Plymouth and Gosport.

[Marine Hospital.]

The Marine Hospital is a new institution, and seems a well conducted charity. March Marine 23d, 1788, there were 146 fine healthy boys.

[Kilmainham.]

DUBLIN County Gaol. At Kilmainham, the four dungeons (called towers) were very dirty: the windows are level with the ground, and look towards the street; in consequence of which, spirits are easily conveyed to the criminals, who are often intoxicated. One evening, I providentially came just in time to extinguish a fire in the straw on which they lay. - I have seen the debtors drinking wine, and some of them drunk, at eleven in the morning. Their rooms, staircase &c. were very dirty. - At my last visit the dungeons were much crowded, and several of the prisoners were sick. Here is no court, and no access to water. - A new prison in a fine situation, is now building.

[Meath Hospital.]

The Meath Hospital in Dublin is the County and though situated in a very close part of the city, yet the wards were clean and quiet, and not in the least offensive, at any of my visits. The gentlemen of the faculty who attend here, have generously resigned to the hospital the bounty of £100 annually paid by government.* March 25th, 1788, 25 Patients.

LEINSTER CIRCUIT.

[Wicklow.]

WICKLOW County Gaol adjoins to the sessions house. On the first floor there is one room for debtors and another for women. Down six steps there are two very damp rooms called the low gaol for felons, which have no air or light but by the iron-grated door towards the street. A small court: no water.

The county proposes to build a new gaol.

1788, May 1, Debtor 1. Felons &c. 9.

Wicklow County Bridewell is a alight building; and, like all such prisons in this country, has no materials for work. May 1st, 1788, 1 Lunatic.

[Hospital.]

The County Infirmary at Wicklow is a house rented by the county. It is out of repair - the cieling of the kitchen fallen in. There were nine beds - the bedding very old, and linen only on one bed. Diet, a sixpenny loaf every four days, and three pints of milk every day.† By the account book of the worthy treasurer, the Rev. Dr. Walls, it appears that the hospital is poor, the whole income being but about £300 a year. The apothecary has a salary of £25 for making up the drugs, which are bought at Dublin, and the surgeon is paid the £100 a year, allowed by government. As the funds are low, the diet (especially for the recovering patients) is scanty; furniture also is much wanted. Would it not therefore be proper to apply part of the king's £100 per to the benefit of the house, as is done in some other infirmaries; especially considering, that the surgeon has advantages by pupils or apprentices, and but few patients? Their number on May 1st, 1788, being only six.

* Every county hospital has by the king's letter, according to the Act in 1766, £100 a year to be applied either to the payment of a physician or surgeon, or some other use of the hospital, as the governors or governesses shall think proper: and besides the endowments and annual contributions, there is presented by the county £100, for the expenses of these hospitals. The surgeon generally receives from the treasurer the £ 100 from government; and drugs or medicines, often to a large amount, are charged to the other accounts.

† Bread and milk is a very proper diet for the general class of patients admitted into the Infirmaries in this country, as they are subject to scrophulous complaints, arising from intemperance and the want of attention to cleanliness.

Leinster Circuit. IRELAND. 85

[Wexford.]

WEXFORD County Gaol. This prison was clean and white-washed, and the prisoners had proper bedding. A new court, with a sea water bath, and an infirmary and court are some of the improvements which the county is making. I hope the offensiveness of the sewers in the prison will be remedied.

1788, May 2, Debtors 7. Felons &c. 12.

[Hospital.]

The County Infirmary at Wexford is well situated - out of the town - and has no buildings adjoining. Having been built for a private house, the cielings are too low.

The upper sashes in this, and indeed in almost all the county infirmaries, are not moveable as they ought to be. There were twelve beds with good bedding and sheets, enclosed improperly in boxes, though the boxes were somewhat larger than in other infirmaries. Diet 2½d in white bread, and three pints of new milk a day. The funds are under £300 per annum. Till lately, the apothecary had been allowed £6 a year for making up the medicines, and was to furnish the drugs at prime cost: but his bills, in 1786 amounting to £100, the governors have since thought proper to order the drugs to be bought in Dublin, and, having medicinal herbs in their own garden, they have ordered the surgeon (who is paid the king's £100) to make up the medicines. The expense therefore in 1787 fell considerably below £40. This infirmary enjoys the benefit of an annual ball, which in 1787 produced £40: 5: 6. May 2d, 1788, 12 Patients.

[Kilkenny.]

KILKENNY County and City Gaols. In the County Gaol there were some improvements, and it was white-washed, and cleaner than at my former visits; but still there are dungeons, and the windows are towards the street. Here I saw a neat little woman, who was committed for assisting her husband when he was fighting and had his jaw broken. Bread allowance two-pence a day. I carefully weighed the twopenny loaves of both the prisons (which are served by the same baker) and found the weight on June 9, 1787, one pound and three ounces. By the last assize, on the 23d of the preceding month, the weight ought to have been one pound ten ounces and two drams. A fourpenny loaf of household-bread in the city, whiter and better than that in the prison, weighed three pounds and one ounce; but by the assize, it should have weighed three pounds four ounces and four drams. To prevent such abuses, it was enacted 3d of Geo. III. Chap. xxviii. "That the minister or curate shall weekly deliver bread, to be by them, or either of them, bought upon the best terms that bread is usually sold for, in the parish for which, by the said act, he is allowed a sum not exceeding £10 yearly."

[Hospital.]

Kilkenny County Hospital. A spacious house, - but there were only five patients at Hospital, any visits in 1787 and 1788. - The house-keeper complained of the poverty of the hospital, - Two medical gentlemen attend, each of whom receives £40 a year.

86 IRELAND. Leinster Circuit.

[Carlow.]

CARLOW County Gaol was built in 1783. The cells are too close; sewers offensive. Allowance in bread, which is distributed only twice a week. The inspector has a salary of £10, and for his office of inspector £20, according to a late act.

1788, April 14, Debtors 4. Felons &c. 5.

[Hospital.]

At Carlow the County Infirmary is properly situated out of the town. The patients lay in close boxes. The wards were quiet. - The floors were sanded, which I always consider as an expedient to hide the dirt. April 14th, 1788, 10 Patients.

[Kildare.]

KILDARE County. A new County Gaol is building at Naas in the centre of the town. The situation is improper, and the plan bad: - the staircase narrow (two feet nine inches): - the entrance and passages dark. - The vaults in the passages must be offensive and unhealthy.

1787, June 26, Debtors 3. Felons &c. 19.

[Hospital.]

The County Infirmary at Kildare has six good rooms on the first floor, three of which were occupied by seven patients - some had no sheets - others only one - the blankets were dirty and worn out. Diet, a twopenny loaf of white bread, a quart of new milk, and water gruel every day. Fuel allowed only from the first of October to the first of April, a limitation exceedingly improper in hospitals. - Here is a good bath, but it is seldom or never used.

[Maryborough.]

MARYBOROUGH County Gaol. A court having been lately enclosed, and several rooms added, the apartments towards the street, and the damp cellar are not now used. Allowance in bread 3d. a day; weight in 1787 2lb. 5½oz. Here, and at several other places, I had the pleasure to find, that the prisoners were not defrauded in their bread. The county proposes to build a new gaol: I hope not on the old ground, though it adjoins to the court-house; as, at a little distance, the place where the old barracks stood is spacious, and has every advantage for the site of a county gaol, being airy and near the river, and has a well of fine water.

The Infirmary at Maryborough for Queen's County is an old house in which are four rooms for patients. The floor of the room below was dirt, and the walls were black and filthy: it had in it three patients. In two of the rooms above there were thirteen beds and fifteen patients. In a room called the tower, two patients, and a little dirty hay on the floor, on which they said the nurse lay. This room was very dirty, the cieling covered with cobwebs, and in several places open to the sky. Here I saw one naked, pale object, who was under the necessity of tearing his shirt for bandages for his fractured thigh. No sheets in the house, - and the blankets were very dirty. No vault: no water. - The diet is a threepenny loaf and two pints of milk; or rather, if my

taste did not deceive me, of milk and water. - The surgery was a clowet about ten feet by six, the furniture consisted of ten vials, some of them without corks, of a little salve thick on a board; some tow, and pieces of torn paper scattered on the floor. This hospital, besides the £100 a year, has a county presentment of £200, the same as that at Cashel. These two, are the only infirmaries in the kingdom which have this large county presentment. April 16th, 1788, 20 Patients.

[Philipstown.]

PHILIPSTOWN County Gaol was slightly built about twenty-five years ago, and is quite out of repair and insecure. The rooms are dirty, and seem to have never been white-washed. The court not secure, and the pump long useless. The gaoler (and not the county) was lately fined for the escape of some prisoners.

In the County Infirmary at Tullamore, there are two rooms on the first floor: in that for men there were five beds, and in the other for women three. The house was clean and quiet; and in the men's room there was a good fire. There being only one female patient she was in the kitchen. The accounts are regularly kept, and a proper attention is paid to the patients. A foundation is laid for a new infirmary. April 19th, 1788, 6 Patients.

MUNSTER CIRCUIT.

[Waterford.]

WATERFORD County Gaol. A woman was confined with the men in their dungeon. A lunatic now as at a former visit occupied the women's room, who, as the gaoler said, had been there twenty-seven years in March 1787, though by the 3d of Geo. III. Chap. xxviii. the grand juries are empowered to raise any sum not exceeding £30, to build a room, in addition to the present gaols, for persons of insane mind, and outrageous behaviour.

About a week before my last visit, seven prisoners unrivetted the bolts with which they were ironed, and having made with them an aperture in the wall, effected their escape. I have often complained that these bolt irons are so much used in Ireland, as they are very painful to the prisoners, and dangerous instruments when they get them off, which is done without much difficulty.

A new county gaol, too splendid, and built on a bad plan, is not yet occupied.

[House of Industry.]

Waterford House of Industry. This is a clean well regulated house, and does great credit to the gentlemen who preside over it. The employment is picking oakum, and weaving. The number in this house May 4th, 1788, was 122.

[Infirmaries.]

Lord Tyrone's Infirmary at Waterford is an old house with four rooms for patients. The beds were in covered cases - had a little straw - and some old blankets - there were no more than two or three sheets for all the beds. No water. 1788, May 4th, ten patients.

The City Infirmary is an old house adjoining Lord Tyrone's and communicating with it. The rooms and furniture were dirty. No water. The surgery consisted of one pot of ointment or salve, and eighteen old empty drawers. 1788, May 4th, seven patients. - The corporation is building a spacious infirmary, in a fine situation, from livings out of an estate originally granted for an hospital for lepers.

[Clonmell.]

CLONMELL County Gaol. The six dungeons very dirty. - A large dunghil in the yard. - A military guard, as in most of the prisons in Ireland, consisting of twelve men, under the command of a serjeant and corporal. - Some of them were playing at tennis in the prison yard. Such diversions as occasion riot and confusion should, in these places, be strictly prohibited. - Several prisoners died here a little before the April assize, 1787. At my last visit I found that men and women debtors were confined in the same room. Though the dungeons were crowded, yet at night some of the wives and children of the felons continued with them. Few of the men were in irons, and the savage custom of putting irons on women is practised only in England. A new gaol for this county is now building.

[Hospital.]

In the County Infirmary at Cashel, there are four good wards, the governors duly attend, and great care seems to be taken of the patients. When their funds were low, they reduced the surgeon's salary to £50, but on their increasing, they raised it again in November 1787 to the former sum of £80. By a late act this hospital has a presentment from the county of £200 a year. The drugs for the patients are bought in Dublin, and paid for by the treasurer of the hospital. I would just submit to the attention of these gentlemen, whether removing the wood testers of the beds, and making windows in the wards, for producing a better circulation of air, opposite to those with which they are already furnished, would not render this infirmary more favourable to the health of the patients. April 13th, 1788, 15 Patients.

[Cork.]

CORK County Gaol. No court. - I saw spirituous liquors conveyed to the prisoners; and this cannot be entirely prevented by the most careful keeper, where the windows are towards the street. The prison was clean and quiet. The placid countenances of the prisoners bespoke the keeper to be humane and attentive.

[City Gaol.]

Cork City Gaol. No court: no water on the felons' side: the prison very dirty and offensive. Here also I saw spirituous liquors given in to the prisoners. By the confusion, discontent and hatred, discovered in the countenances of the prisoners when the gaoler was with me in 1787, I am convinced that he was negligent and inattentive:* but at my last visit they had a new keeper, and the gaol was clean and quiet. Here were several prisoners detained for their fees to the clerk of the crown, sheriffs, gaoler and turnkey. Debtors have a sixpenny loaf a week; the allowance of criminals, in this city, is only two eightpenny loaves in a week (on Monday and Friday); but by the Act of Geo. III. grand juries are enjoined to present three-pence a day for the subsistence of every person confined for an offence. Inspector, Rev. Mr. Forsayeth, salary £20; and £10 for distributing the prisoners' bread. Keeper's salary £25, and £10 in lieu of fees of persons discharged the spring assize 1787.

[House of Industry.]

Cork House of Industry. Some of the rooms were clean; but many of the beds were only a little straw, worn to dust. - The neglect of a frequent removal of the heaps of dust &c. in the courts here, at Clonmell, and many other places, may be one cause of unhealthiness. - June 15th, 1787, the number confined here was eighty men, and one hundred and twenty women. A few years ago the profits by the work of the house amounted to

18: 12: 6. But of late, in consequence of allowing all a fourth of their own earnings, and another fourth to the steward and house-keeper, the house is become a gainer; for the profits of the work amounted in 1786 to £26: 18: 6.‡

* A keeper should be firm and steady, yet mild; and he should visit every day all the wards of his prison. Such a man will have much more influence and authority than the violent and passionate gaoler, who is profane and inhuman, and often beating and kicking his prisoners.

† In this city, and at Limerick, there is a society for the relief and discharge of debtors for small sums. This useful and benevolent society is greatly beholden to Mr. Archdeacon Corker. for his unremitted care and attention.

[Cork Infirmaries.]

In the North Infirmary at Cork, all the rooms were close and offensive; - not a window open in the whole house. Those windows which had wire lattices are now close glazed. May 12th, 1788, there were eight patients.*

In the South Infirmary the wards of both the men and women were clean and fresh, and had all the windows open. None of the beds were furnished with sheets; and the blankets were dirty and torn. The men (improperly) pass through the women's ward. Allowance for diet is two shillings a week, but sixpence of it is paid to the nurse. With this scanty allowance, which can only supply them with potatoes and milk, I am persuaded they recover sooner than on better allowance in the close and dirty wards of the north infirmary. 1788, May 12th, six men and two women.

[Foundling Hospital.]

The Foundling Hospital has been greatly improved since my visit in 1787, and the children are more healthy. As a stream runs close to the house, a convenient bath might be easily procured. May 12th, 1788, 140 Children.†

[Kinsale.]

Kinsale Town Gaol is at the Cork gate. The debtors room is over the gateway, and has only one window. On the ground floor there are two rooms for criminals, properly called the black hole. No court - no water. In this prison, which is bad, and quite out of repair, the gaoler and his wife have lived forty-three years, and in that time not one prisoner has died in the house. May 10th, 1788, No prisoners.

[Mitchells Town Bridewell.]

The Bridewell at Mitchells Town is a new built by Lord Kingsborough. It wants lime-whiting, and the windows are towards the street. Here was lately a sickness among the prisoners, which, I apprehend, was occasioned by the very offensive sewers in the rooms, and the want of a court and water. April 11th, 1788, No prisoners.

* "It is the opinion of Dr. Arbuthnot, that renewing and cooling the air in a patient's room, by opening the bed curtains, door, and windows, in some cases letting it in by pipes, and in general the right management of air in the bed-chamber, is among the chief branches of regimen in inflammatory diseases, provided still that the intention of keeping up a due quantity of perspiration be not disappointed." And Dr. Fordyce adds, "By the officious and mistaken care of silly nurses in this respect, the disease is often increased and lengthened, or even proves fatal. - Numberless indeed are the mischiefs which arise from depriving the patient of cool air; the changing of which, so as to remove the putrid steams, is most of all necessary in putrid diseases." - I hope I shall be excused in adding, "In the beginning of putrid fevers (and many putrid fevers come upon a full habit) the patient abhors, without knowing the reason, foods which easily putrify, but pants after acid drinks And fruits; and such are allowed by some physicians who follow nature. Oranges, lemons, citrons, grapes, peaches, currants, nectarines, are devoured with eagerness and gratitude. Can the distillery or the apothecary's shop boast of such cordials? - It appears then on the whole, that the food in a putrid fever should consist of barley, rice, oatmeal, wheat bread, sago, salop, mixed with wine, lemon, orange, citron, or chaddock juice, jellies made of currants and other acescent fruits; and when broths are thought absolutely necessary, which probably happens but seldom, they should be mixed with currant jellies, citron, lemon, and orange juices."

† I had the pleasure to hear that the worthy Mayor of Cork, Samuel Rowland Esq. with the concurrence of the corporation, has abolished the two annual dinners on the election, and swearing-in days, of the chief magistrate and sheriffs, which were the occasion of much irregularity; and substituted in lieu thereof a permanent and most useful charity, to be supported by the money formerly expended therein, amounting in the whole to £200. This annual sum is to be disposed of by trustees for the relief of indigent freemen, their wives and children; and there is reason to hope that it will receive a future augmentation by bequests and donations.

[Tralee.]

TRALEE County Gaol consists of four rooms, one for debtors, two for criminals, and one (to which the ascent is by a ladder) called the infirmary. No court - no water. A woman is paid for standing at the grate to serve the prisoners with water. There was a dunghil at the entrance of the prison, and all the rooms were dirty. Here is a military guard as at many other prisons in this country. The inspector distributes daily the county allowance in two-pennyworth of bread and a pennyworth of milk. Coals are given to debtors and felons. Gaoler's salary £30. - A new gaol is building.

The County Infirmary at Tralee is a ruinous house - the roof falling in. There were eight old bedsteads in four very dirty rooms - never white-washed. The patients lay on a little hay or straw, and found their own scanty bedding. Diet, bread and milk. April 9th, 1788, 4 Patients.

[Limerick.]

LIMERICK County and City Gaol are one prison, but the debtors and felons of each are quite separate. The room (or crib) for the city felons is twenty-two feet by twenty. And into this narrow compass, there are crowded sometimes (as the gaoler told me) sixty or seventy men. The bridewell in this prison is a miserable dungeon of the same size. No court - no water.

[House of Industry.]

Limerick House of Industry. Very dirty: - no order nor regulations. In the kitchen were fowls, and in other rooms, dogs; nuisances, very common in prisons and hospitals, in this country. - At the end of the garden are several cells, where lunatics of both sexes were left to the care of one old man. Over these cells, improperly, is the infirmary, which was very dirty. - June 21st, 1787, there were thirty-nine men and forty-two women.

[County Hospital.]

Limerick County Infirmary, built in 1766, was in 1787 in very bad condition, but I had the pleasure to find it in 1788, thoroughly repaired, white-washed, and furnished with new bedding; for which the patients are indebted to the attention of Lady Hartstonge, who has also put in a cleanly and notable matron. The allowance only 2d. a day, for the diet of each patient. Should not the governors consider that criminals in their county gaol are allowed 3d. by act of parliament? - A piece of waste ground adjoining, which belongs to Sir Henry Hartstonge, might be made of great use to this hospital. April 6th, 1788, 16 Patients.

Another hospital in this city, in a fine situation, is almost finished.

ROSCOMMON County Gaol. Clean and quiet - lately white-washed. The prisoners from this, and most other gaols, are tried out of irons, which is the more necessary, as in Ireland the bolt irons, and not chains, are in general use. No water: - no vaults. The attentive local inspector, the Rev. Mr. Seton serves out the allowance to the criminals twice a week; viz. for four men three quarts of oatmeal (about twelve ounces each man) twenty-one pound of potatoes, and five quarts of milk. A new gaol is building on nearly the same bad construction as that at Naas.

The County Infirmary at Roscommon, as appears by the inscription over the door, "was built for the poor of this county, at the sole expense of Mrs. Walcott, sister to the late lord chief justice Caulfield of Donamon, 1783." This lady also generously subscribes £50 a year towards the support of the infirmary. The wards were quiet and not dirty, and the beds were furnished with sheets and proper bedding. Diet, 1½lb. of bread and a quart of new milk a day. - I would just hint, the propriety of white-washing this house and enclosing the ground before the front. - I saw no pump - no vault - no turf-house. April 10th, 1788, 10 Patients.

[Carrick.]

COUNTY of LEITRIM. The County Gaol at CARRICK on Shannon adjoins to the court-house. The criminals were in a black and dark cell several steps under ground: the windows of this and of another night cell were towards the street. The walls of the court being ruinous, the prisoners are never out. No water. Allowance a threepenny loaf five days of the week, and two days potatoes. The county finds proper bedding for the prisoners.

[Sligo.]

SLIGO County Gaol was dirty, as is generally the case where there is no water in the court. Fine water might there be easily procured. The windows look towards the street; and when I was in the county infirmary at a little distance, I saw spirituous liquors handed in to the prisoners, and heard a noise and riot, which must disturb the patients and neighbourhood. Two bottles of whiskey are paid for garnish here, and in many other gaols. A fourpenny loaf of the prisoners household bread weighed only 1lb. 13oz. Gaoler's salary £30.

CASTLEBAR County Gaol. The old gaol has no court, no water. Many poor wretches have been almost suffocated in this small prison. Forty-two prisoners have been confined in a room twenty-one feet by seventeen. A new gaol is built on too small a scale, and the cells are close and dark. Gaoler's Salary £30.

The County Infirmary at Castlebar is an old ruinous house, very dirty, and the windows were stopt with straw. No linen; and no blankets but such as are found by the patients. Only one room (eighteen feet and a half by fifteen and a half) for kitchen, turf-house and wash-house, and for the nurse's lodging, which is under the staircase. Diet is water-pottage and one pint of milk a day; besides one sheep's head boiled for soup for all the patients on three days of the week, and on three other days a pennyworth of bread for each patient (weight 8oz). The court in this, as in many other infirmaries, is very dirty, and has no conveniences. March 31st, 1788, 16 Patients.

[Mullingar.]

MULLINGAR County Goal. Allowance 3d. a day in good household bread, (weight in 1787 three pounds and a half) with plenty of turf for fuel: and the countenances of the prisoners shewed that a humane and proper attention is paid to them, £1100 was paid to the clergyman for bread, fire and candles for the prisoners, the three years preceding my first visit, and he made affidavits to his accounts. This was a shameful fraud, and it was detected by Baron Hamilton. The prison is now supplied by Mr. Tyrrell, and he said that the account for the year 1787 would not exceed £90, though the number of prisoners was greater than usual. His account of the winter half year, from August 1786 to March 1787, amounted only to £46: 11: 5½.

The county is building a new gaol on a fine spot, and a stream runs through the court; yet I fear it is on too small a scale for solitary confinement at night; as the gaoler said, that the last assize he had forty-two criminals. And I have a much greater dislike to the confinement of two in a cell, than to the crowding of many into one room.

† Wilson's Hospital in the county of West Meath is a spacious building, and finely situated. Jt was founded by a private gentleman for lodging, boarding and clothing one hundred boys and twenty old men. The house was dirty (especially the two infirmary rooms) and is never white-washed. The boys were clean, but their clothes and linen in rags. The old men were crowded into two rooms, and lay two in a bed - they were shivering with cold, fuel not being allowed after March 25th. There were fifteen cows for the house, and a fine tract of land in the front - yet the boys and men were scantily supplied with milk, potatoes and greens. Having heard the boys of different standings read, I am persuaded they have an attentive school-master. His salary is 25 Guineas a year. - A resident clergyman is allowed £150. The steward's salary is only 2£0 or £30, but I saw by the annual account he was a creditor for £1969: 15: 7 in one sum. April 25th, 1788, there were only sixty-nine boys and eighteen men. And though one hundred and three boys were petitioning for admission, no board had sat these two years.

LONGFORD County Gaol. A bad prison. Dungeons about four feet under ground: windows towards the street: passage dark, three feet five inches wide. A prisoner, committed for only a month, was lately detained here several months for his fees, amounting to £1: 10: 3. In this, and similar instances, the expense of the bread allowance to prisoners exceeds the amount of the fees. - A presentment has been made for building a new gaol. I found one of the finest spots for that purpose, on a declivity, near the river, clear of most buildings, near the sessions house, and adjoining to the barracks.

[Cavan.]

CAVAN County Gaol, lately built. - No court, though a convenient area is contiguous. - Water from a well on the outside, into which I saw the rain-water run from the street. - The rooms very dirty and offensive; - never white-washed. Prisoners double bolted. The bar-bolts are cruel; for they give more pain to the prisoners when lying or walking than iron chains. - Windows closed for fear of tools being conveyed. Here I cannot but remonstrate against the negligence of inspectors* and gaolers, and their idle excuses for the omission of washing prisons, on which the health of the prisoners so much depends. The gaoler lives at a distance; salary £20. But by a shameful neglect, neither his salary, nor the fees for acquitted prisoners have been paid him, for four or five years.

* Some of the under sheriffs in Ireland are guilty of a great abuse in taking 20 or 30 guineas of the gaolers for their appointments, which lays them under the necessity of many exactions on prisoners.

"No sheriff, or other person or persons, bodies corporate or politic, having powers to appoint a gaoler, shall, by themselves or any other person in trust for them, take any fee or gratuity, or reserve any rent payable out of any such gaol for such appointment, under the penalty of £500; one moiety thereof to be paid to the king, the other to the informer, with full costs of suit."

A new gaol is proposed to be built, which I doubt not will be effected, by the spirited exertions of Mr. Conolly, one of the county members.

1787, July 15, Debtors 12. Felons &c. 23.

[Hospital.]

Londonderry Hospital for the County of L. Derry. Two rooms in the poor-house. July 15th, 1787, thirteen Patients. Dr. Ferguson has the £100, from the king's letter, but generously gives £50 towards the maintenance of the poor in this house, and pays for all the medicines.

ULSTER North-East CIRCUIT.

[Dundalk.]

COUNTY of LOUTH. DUNDALK County Gaol. Water is conveyed into every cell, so that the sewers are not offensive. - A dunghill in the court as at Monaghan.† At the Lent Assize 1787, Judge Kelly discharged immediately from the Dock all the prisoners who were acquitted: and Sir S. Bradstreet always does the same.

1787, July 21, Debtors 5. Felons &c. 8.

* I visited the poor-house at Londonderry. Here were sixty-five old, decayed inhabitants. All clean and orderly. They are allowed the profit of any little work they are able to do. Their provision is wholesome and good, which they receive cheerfully at two meals (ten and three.) Mr. Young, a dissenting clergyman, constantly attends; and has been, for two years, the frugal and faithful treasurer.

Mr. Young gives the same assiduous attention to a Sunday school, which was here opened Dec. 5, 1785. About sixty boys regularly attend every Sunday, two hours in the morning, and two in the evening. There are three masters. The whole expense for instruction or schooling, books, firing &c. to July 16, 1787, amounted only to £17: 18: 0 as I saw in Mr. Young's books.

† On my observing that some of the rooms were dirty in this gaol, the keeper replied, "We thought there would be no eyes over us till the assize." I mention this as a hint to gentlemen who look into prisons only on public days.

[Dundalk Hospital.]

Dundalk Hospital for the county of Louth. The rooms towards the street. - The patients lay in boxes, but had proper bedding and sheets. - The bread good. A book is kept for noting down the provisions as they come in.* July 21st, 1787, there were thirteen Patients.

[Downpatrick.]

COUNTY of DOWN. DOWNPATRICK County Gaol. No water. - The rooms paved with small stones, and very dirty and offensive: - windows towards the street. - An offensive vault in the passage. - The chapel and two courts not used for many years.

1787, July 22, Debtors 9. Felons &c. 2

[Hospital.]

Downpatrick Hospital for the County of Down. Formerly a barrack: - wants whitewashing. July 22d, 1787, nine Men, six Women. In a late annual account, the whole expense was £743: - for drugs £52: 14: 2; apparently an enormous sum, when the general number of patients was only from twelve to eighteen. Surgery room dirty, and in great disorder.†

[Carrickfergus.]

COUNTY of ANTRIM. CARRICKFERGUS County Gaol. A fine stream runs through the court; and pipes being laid into almost every room and cell, prevent this prison from being in the least offensive. Here is a large expensive and inconvenient tub for a bath, but never used. - Judge Robinson once fined the gaoler £20, for not taking off the irons of a prisoner before his trial. Mr. Campbell, the good old surgeon, never permits spirituous liquors (too often allowed through mistaken humanity) to be brought even to the debtors.

1787, July 26, Debtors 5. Felons &c. 21.

[Town Gaol.]

Town Gaol. No court: no water. This was the county gaol when I was here about ten years ago.

1787, July 26, 1 Prisoner.

[Lisburn Hospital.]

Lisburn Hospital for the County of Antrim. The wards quiet and clean; but the house wants white-washing. Here is a kind and proper attention paid to the patients. Religious service is performed every Sunday, and the clergyman notes it down in a book.

* In the house-keeper's book there are six columns on every leaf: the first specifying the days of the week: second, number in the house; third, new milk; fourth, butter-milk; fifth, bread; sixth, oatmeal; and at the bottom, the weight of the sixpenny loaf, which at my visit was 3lb. 5oz.

† Dr. Blane, Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital; in his Observations on the Diseases incident to Seamen (printed in 1785.) says, "If men are not constrained to keep their persons sweet, their cloathing and bedding clean, and their berths (or apartments) airy and dry, the most efficacious remedies, and the most skilful physicians and surgeons will be to little purpose." He relates in the account of the sick sent from the fleet that arrived "at New York in 1782, that each man on the sick list was supplied every week at the public expense with four pounds of apples, and half a pound of soap. - That the supply of soap was a thing entirely new in the service; but the good effect of all the other articles would most probably have been defeated, unless men had been furnished with the means of cleanliness, which is the most essential requisite of health." page 145.

The governors also, in their occasional visits write down their observations. July 45th, Lisburn 1787, 5 Patients.*

[Armagh.]

ARMAGH County Gaol. Built about six years since by the munificence of the Lord Primate. - Too small for the number of prisoners. - A kitchen and a large cell, being under ground and damp, are not used. - All the prisoners are allowed fuel, bed-steads and proper bedding. Gaoler's salary, £20.†

1787, July 20, Debtors 2. Felons &c. 18.

[Armagh Hospital.]

Armagh County Hospital. Built by the Lord Primate in 1768. The surgeon resides in the hospital in very large apartments. The wards are spacious; but the patients lay in a sort of boxes or cupboards, which in several respects are improper; they are close and offensive - the beds cannot be so conveniently made - nor the bedding aired, - and the tops are a harbour for litter and dust. No baths; nor do I recollect any in use in other county hospitals, though very conducive to the health of patients. July 19th, 1787, seven Men and three Women.

[Monaghan.]

MONAGHAN County Gaol. A court, and water. - In this, and almost all the Irish gaols, there is neither infirmary nor bath. - The window of the women's room opening towards the street, several idle fellows were standing at it. - A dunghill in the court; a nuisance which the local inspector should never permit.

1787, July 20, Debtors 13. Felons &c. 33.

[Hospital.]

Monaghan County Hospital. Built about twenty years ago on very elevated ground: access to it should be made more easy: - never white-washed. July 20th, 1787, nine Patients. Regulations made in 1770, and a diet-table, hung up. I was glad to see among the rules, "No patient shall smoke tobacco in the infirmary." Such a rule is pretty general in English hospitals.

[Trim.]

COUNTY of MEATH. TRIM County Gaol. This prison consists of four stories, and has eighteen cells and three day rooms. The walls of the court are lofty. Eleven criminals who were left untried at the last assize, having got off their bolt irons and confined the gaoler, had nearly effected their escape.‡

1788, April 25, Debtors 5. Felons &c. 25.

* I visited the poor-house at Belfast, which is finely situated, but many of the lodging-rooms are down ten steps, and a wall only ten feet distant, is level with the top of the windows. Might not the spacious hall, and rooms adjoining be used for a better purpose than the occasional diversions of young persons in the town? The front court is quite open. All such houses should be enclosed, to prevent the poor from wandering about, and carrying out or introducing any thing improper. July 24, 1787, 54 Men, 53 Women, 31 Boys, 21 Girls. The Belfast Charitable Society for the support of this house, was incorporated by an Act of the 14th of Geo. III.

† When the salaries of gaolers are so small, persons of credit will hardly accept of the trust; and others will be too ready to make cruel exactions from the prisoners. I here give this hint more willingly, because I know the great generality of the Lord Primate; and that he is ready to encourage every thing that is liberal and humane.

‡ The number of prisoners which I found in Ireland in 1787 and 1788, shall be given in a table at the end of the book.

[Navan County Infirmary.]

The County Infirmary at Navan has an inscription over the door, "I was sick and you visited me. Matt. xxv. 36. 1754." It is in a good situation - has five rooms for patients - wants white-washing - the bedsteads old with testers to them - the furniture dirty - the sheets brown, and only one on a bed - no pump - no proper bath. - Besides the presentments, there is an annual ball for the support of this house. April 25th, 1788, 24 Patients.*

It may not be improper to repeat here an observation which I made in my former publication, with respect to the English prisons &c. which I had then been visiting; viz. I have here and there taken the liberty of pointing out what seemed to me, as I viewed a prison or hospital, an obvious remedy of some defect that happened to strike me. But I did not examine with the accuracy of a surveyor; and hope I shall not be thought to direct in the style of a dictator.

* Doctor Ingen-house in his Expériences sur les Végétaux, published in 1787, has so well expressed my sentiments on this subject, that I hope I shall be excused copying this long note.

"Nous voyons que la longue vie des hommes dépend en grande partie de la bonté de l'air qu'ils respirent. Les meilleurs alimens ne font pas en état de nous garantir des maladies dans un pays malfain, au lieu qu'on peut se porter tres-bien avec des alimens d'une qualite inferieure, lorsque l'on respire un air très-pur." - And with respect to the necessity of attention to cleanliness, some observations which the ingenious Doctor mentions relative to ships, are equally applicable to prisons and hospitals. - "Un des grands moyens de conserver la santé des marins, est de tenir l'intérieur du vaisseau propre, d'y changer l'air souvent, soit par des ventilateurs, soit par l'agitation des portes de communication, soit par l'agitation de draps souvent répétée, &c. J'ai souvent éprouvé avec quelle facilité on peut renouveller tout l'air d'une chambre par la seule agitation de la porte, ou par le mouvement violent d'un drap, ou par quelque autre moyen qui force l'air de changer de place, &c de se mêler avec l'air libre. Deux ou trois minutes suffisent pour renouveller tout l'air d'un grand appartement, & pour donner à un malade qui y est au lit, le soulagement le plus sensible. - Toute nation qui fait peu de cas de la propreté personnelle, & de celle de ses habitations, qui n'a aucune aversion de voir par-tout s'accumuler des faletés, dont on a soin d'écarter jusqu'aux vestiges dans d'autres pays; qui s'accoutume dès l'enfance à vivre au milieu des ordures; qui peut tolérer, même dans l'interieur de ses maisons, des cloaques le plus abominables de faletés, qui seroient horreur aux sauvages les moins policés, & dont l'aspect degoutant seroit capable de faire soulever l'estomac aux peuples qui n'ont jamais vu que la propreté la plus exacte dans ces endroits retirés de nécessité*: toute nation, dis-je, qui ne cultive pas assez la propreté personnelle & dans ses habitations, doit naturellement avoir peu d'aversion, étant sur mer, de vivre parmi les mêmes malpropretés avec lesquelles elle s'est familiarisée dès son enfance. Mais s'il paroit qu'il importe peu, pour la santé des habitans d'une maison, qu'elle soit sale ou nette, il est néanmoins bien certain qu'on ne peut pas négliger impunément la propreté dans un navire, dans lequel une foule de gens est entassée. Cette négligence y produira bientôt un air corrompu, qui, à son tour, engendrera le germe de cette terrible maladie qu'on voit se produire par la même cause dans les hôpitaux trop pleins & trop peu aérés, & dans les prisons, où beaucoup de misérables croupissent dans leurs propres faletés." - He adds, "On a vu souvent des nations puissantes, qui devoient naturellement triompher par la masse énorme de leurs forces de terre & de mer, succomber précisément par les effets de cette mal-propreté habituelle sur leurs flottes & dans leurs armées."

* "Le nom de garde-robe, consacré par un long usage à ces endroits, dénote assez que la mal-propreté a été de tout temps un vice, non du bas-peuple, mais de la nation même: mal-propreté si enracinée, que même jusqu'a présent, lorsque la plupart des nations Europeennes rougissent de souffrir, dans l'enceinte le leur maison, ces cloaques revoltans & abominables, un étranger se trouve, au milieu de la capitale, dans le plus grand embarras, pour trouver, même dans les bonnes maisons, un endroit où il puisse, à son aise, satisfaire au besoin de la nature, & sauver ses vêtemens de la crotte."

SECTION VII.

CHARTER SCHOOLS IN IRELAND.

In Ireland there are thirty-eight Charter Schools, designed for the instruction of the children of the popish and other poor natives in the English tongue, and the principles of loyalty and true religion; besides two called the Ranelagh Schools, which admit only the children of protestants.

In two journeys into Ireland, some years since, I looked into several of these schools, carrying with me the account of them published at the end of the last sermon that had been then preached to the society. I afterwards waited on the committee of fifteen in Dublin, and having reported various apparent abuses, some alterations were made. But I am fully persuaded that this noble charity still greatly wants a reformation, and a parliamentary inquiry for that purpose.

Some general observations on these schools were given in my publication in 1784; but having visited many of them in 1787, and made a report to the committee of the House of Commons in 1788; and afterwards, in an extensive tour, visited several more of these schools; I shall now give a particular account of them.

[Dublin County.]

Clontarf-Strand School. June 7th, 1787, fifty-three boys - many were employed in spinning - several had cutaneous eruptions on their hands; but the old master having been-discharged, they looked better, in general, than at my former visits. Allowance for diet for each boy is three-pence a day; and the master pays a halfpenny a day for the work of each boy. Linen scanty: children shifted only once a week. Salary to matter and mistress: £24 Irish; besides £30 for three maid-servants. At my visit in 1788 I saw a report of the local committee expressing that the boys' shoes were in a "terrible state; the stockings miserably bad, so that in one week they were worn out; their clothes made of the worst materials, and infamously tacked together." March 10th, 1788, 66 Boys.

Santry school. June 7, 1787, forty-two girls. - The house not white-washed, nor in repair. - The children healthy; and this then seemed to me one of the best of the schools. Employment spinning. - Children's linen changed once a week. - Half-year's allowance for soap and candles £4: 1: 0. The matter and mistress receive a salary of £12; but are required to pay for the work of three fourths of the children, twenty shillings a year each; and to the society, for thirty-three acres of land £37: 4: 0. Here also the master complained of the badness of the clothing. At my visits in 1788, the house was dirty, and at dinner I saw no attention to order and regularity. March 10th, 1788, 45 Girls and the 28th of the same month, 33 Girls.

[Charter Schools.]

[Santry School.]

The following is a copy of the report of the Rev. Mr. Grant, "I must however again repeat, that the master of Castlebar school appears to have been very inattentive to their education, to send girls, most of whom are from fifteen to eighteen years of age from under his care, so very ill-informed in every branch of their education." Several of these girls could not read. - Removals have been made in several of the schools that the boys and girls may be separate.

[Kilkenny County.]

Kilkenny School. June 9, 1787, thirty-three boys. - Much cleaner than at my former visits: - rules and orders hung up. - In the infirmary no beds. - Salary to the master £6, and mistress £6.* The servant's wages and diet, only £5. Soap and candles £5. Fuel £7. The master and mistress pay 15s. a year for the work of each child, but complain of losing by such a charge. Annual allowance for the clothing of each child was £1: 5: 0. Here is a good usher, at eight guineas a year. I found the following report in the book: "April 8, 1788, the boys being afflicted with a spotted fever occasions us not to meet at the school as usual." My visit having been made a few days after the date of this report, I am persuaded that such caution was needless. April 14th, 1788, 33 Boys.

[Waterford County.]

Killoteran school. June 10, 1787, fifty-two boys. - The house and rooms perfectly clean; as also the children, though many in rags.† - Employment, spinning cotton and linen. - The master and mistress here also complained of losing by the work, for which they pay as at Kilkenny school. - No usher: - the mistress and her daughter were teaching the little children to read. - Salary to the master and mistress £6 each. - Premium £8; for in this and other schools premiums or bounties are sometimes given as an encouragement to those who seem most attentive. Allowance only £20 a year for fuel, soap and candles, and £3: 2: 6 for the diet of each, child.

The society, for some years, because the price of oatmeal exceeded eight killings an hundred, made a small addition to the allowance of this, and some other schools: but at a general quarterly meeting on Wednesday, August 3d, 1785, it was resolved that no such allowance should be continued.‡

* In the Charter Schools, the salary to the master and his wife is £6 a year each, besides allowance for diet, the same as for a child. Where there is only a mistress, the salary is £12 a year with a like allowance.

N. B. In the accounts of allowance, the money mentioned always signifies Irish.

£1: 1: 8 Irish is only one pound English; 13d, Irish equal to a shilling English.

† It seems that the influence of cleanliness is extensive; for the cabins near this house were the cleanest and neatest I ever saw in Ireland.

‡ This resolution was sent to the masters of all the charter schools:

"Resolved, that it be, and is hereby recommended to the General Board, to direct that in future no additional expense shall be allowed to the masters or mistresses of any of the charter schools or nurseries, for any supposed advanced price upon the provisions laid in by them, over and above their contract allowances.

"Ordered, that the said resolution be, and the same is hereby, confirmed; and that the masters and mistresses be informed that the society expect that they will in future feed the children with good and wholesome food,

Sect. VII IRELAND. 103

[Charter Schools.]

[Killoteran School.]

At both my visits in 1788 I found this school perfectly clean. The children were neat, and seemed cheerful and happy. (In many of the schools the children run away, or are stolen by their parents; but for several years, not one has deserted from this school). Their learning was not neglected by the master; and his daughter's attention well

"in quantity and quality agreeably to the Society's established dietary, without making any demand as heretofore, for any advance price upon the provisions, above the contract allowance; and that if any master or mistress will not abide by this determination, such are directed to give notice to the secretary, and the society will immediately send down masters and mistresses to succeed them.

"Signed by Order,

"THOS. GIBBONS Sect."

The Diet-Table was fixed as follows:

"At the Annual General Meeting of the Incorporated Society, &c. held on Wednesday, the 1st of November, 1769. The Right Reverend Lord Bishop of Waterford, in the chair. Resolved, that the present Dietary be encreased from the 25th of December next, as to all the articles of provisions, one fourth part, and be amended as follows;

A DIETARY for the CHARTER SCHOOLS.

" One pound and a quarter of oatmeal, or one pound and a quarter of wheat meal, or such a quantity of potatoes as the local committees shall think proper (when the master can be supplied with potatoes from his own plantation, or can provide them on as good terms as he can be furnished with corn) with one quart and half a pint of milk or beer each day, is judged sufficient for the children one with another; to this must be added, ten ounces of flesh meat on each Sunday, and as much on some other day of the week, to be fixed by the local committees, when meat does not exceed two-pence by the pound, and when it exceeds that price, on Sundays only. It is not expected that the masters should give the children a quart and half pint of new milk every day, but one part new milk, and two parts butter milk. Or an equal quantity of new milk and water will answer for drink. These foods are to be given alternately to the children when they can be had reasonably, and varied every meal, or every day or every week, as the local committees shall find cheapest, and most for the convenience of the master. And then the allowance for each child one with another, as to the quantity of provisions weekly, will be as follows;

"Eight pounds and three quarters of wheat or oatmeal,

"Eight quarts and three half pints of milk or beer,

"One pound and a quarter or twenty ounces of flesh meat.

"When the price of wheat or oatmeal grows high, then the children are to be entirely fed upon which ever of them is cheapest, and as the society never refuse to advance money to the masters on the representation of the local committees, when provisions may be had cheap, it is expected that the masters will endeavour to keep down the price of provisions. Resolved, that such allowance as is directed by the dietary, for each child, be made for each and every of the following persons, when they are appointed by the society to be kept in each of the schools, (that is to say) master, mistress, and usher, over and above their respective salaries. Resolved, that the present allowance for cloathing of each child, be encreased from twenty shillings yearly to twenty-five shillings. Ordered, that the local committees of the schools, when they send up the quarterly accounts of the masters, be requested to set forth regularly in that account, the price of each of the articles of provisions, mentioned in the above dietary. Ordered, that these resolutions, dietary, and orders, be printed, and sent down to each of the schools, and that each master do post up the same in the most public place of each school. N.B. The above not to extend to any of the society's nurseries."

"Signed by order, Thomas Gibbons, Secretary."

deserves the salary of a teacher, which is allowed at several schools. - Only one maid; salary £2. Allowance for diet now 3d. a day.* Where the schools are conveniently situated for bathing, as this is, some accommodations should be made for that salutary practice.† May 5th and 16th, 1788, 51 Boys.

[Tipperary County.]

Clonmel School. June 12th, 1787, twenty-nine boys. - House dirty: - wanted beds and bedding. - In the infirmary only two bedsteads, and a little dirty straiw and lumber. - Pantry empty: - children half starved and almost naked. - Usher no allowance; - the master said, he paid one, as he was too old to teach. Allowance for soap and candles only £5. On application to the local committee for allowance for necessaries, the answer was, "the society is poor; they cannot afford it." The last report in the book was June 1st, 1785. At my last visit I found this school in much better order: - the bed rooms were clean. - By hearing several of the boys read, I was convinced that proper attention is now paid to that important part of their education. - The society's clothes are so very bad, that if the boys be not clothed again before Christmas, they must be almost naked. May 5th, 1788, 27 Boys.

[Cork County.]

Iniscara School. Situated two miles from the church. - June 18th, 1787, twenty-six girls: fifteen boys. - The house out of repair, very dirty and full of fleas; - many dogs; some on the beds. - The infirmary was the fuel house, and had no door. - Dairy empty: - the children dirty: seemed half-starved. At my visit, after three o'clock

* I here give an extract from the letter received by the master.

"At a general meeting of the Incorporated Society Sec, 15th April 1788.

"Resolved, that the allowance for feeding the several persons in the charter schools be encreased to three-pence a day for each person; said encreased allowance to take place from the 15th of May next." In this letter a sort of dietary was ordered, and the hours of meals fixed.

From 25th of March to 29th of September.

Breakfast half past eight.

Dinner one.

Supper seven.

From 29th of September to 25th of March.

Breakfast half past nine.

Dinner two.

Supper seven."

I could wish that children were always accustomed to early hours. Breakfast, in the summerhalf year, should not be later than half pad seven, nor in winter than eight: the hour of dinner even in winter should be one; and for supper six. By the present allowance, if the masters do justice to the children, they will now be properly fed.

† Dr. Lind, in his ninth section on the Preservatives of Health on board ships, says, "That by cold bathing in warm weather the body is cooled and refreshed, the fibres braced and invigorated, so that the men become afterwards better enabled to undergo the fatigues and heat of the day. This would prove not only an excellent means of health, but of cleanliness; by cleansing the skin, and invigorating the whole habit, it is so far from stopping the perspiration in hot weather, that it promotes it."

"I can affirm, from my own experience in hot climates, that fluxes and many other complaints have not only been cured by cold bathing, but the return, and even the attack, of such diseases, effectually prevented by it." He adds, "I am persuaded that the remarkable healthfulness of the Tyger ship of war, was more owing to the use of the cold bath, than to any other circumstance."

the children had received no dinner, nor was there any preparation for it till after my inquiries. - Many had the itch and other cutaneous disorders. - Water too distant. - Soap and candles only £4 a year: fuel £10. Here, and in several other schools, the master's children were clean, fresh and healthy. - Linen wanted: application was made for sheets two years since, but none sent. - Dr. Austin, in one of his reports, says, "the pottage is very thin and indifferent:" in another; "the meat scanty, not exceeding three ounces to each child." (Though, being Sunday, it should, according to the diet table, have been ten ounces.) It seems from the book, that none of the local committee had visited this house since August 1785. In 1788 I found this school in much better order, and the rooms cleaner than in 1787. May 10th, 1788, 25 Girls, 15 Boys.

[Cork County.]

Charleville School. June 20th, 1787, twenty-six girls: one boy. The mistress lately appointed:* - the children neat and clean: the rooms close: allowance for soap and candles £5 a year: fuel £10. - No vault: no servant. - Rent for the Society's land raised at Michaelmas 1786 from £8 to £15. - Salary to mistress £12. April 11th, 1788, 26 Girls.

[Tipperary County.]

Newport School. June 23d, 1787, forty girls and two boys. Several of the schools are now appropriated to one sex separately, in which formerly boys and girls were mixed. The house not dirty: the children neat. Annual allowance for soap and candles only £4: for glazing windows five shillings. Sheeting wanted: in October 1785, twenty pair reported; only ten sent. - In this and several other schools complaints are made that there is no allowance for new spinning wheels, or repairing the old ones. One of the boys is an idiot, lame and blind.† I need not repeat the allowance for the diet and clothing of the children, and the pay for their work, as they are the same in almost all the schools.

[King's County.]

Frankfort School. June 23d, 1787, forty-six girls: four boys. The house, school-room, and store-room, very offensive. - Fowls, ducks and pigs in the kitchen. - Children dirty and sickly. - The mistress old and infirm: - all things out of order. - -The boys lay in the room called the infirmary, in which were turkeys and fowls; and

* The mistress was appointed in consequence of this report of the local committee: Dec. 7th, 1786.  Whatever occasion of complaint we have had for some years past relative to the said school, has been solely owing to the master, who had fallen into a habit of drinking, of which our remonstrance could not break him, of which we before took notice to the Society in some of our reports. The situation of the mistress is very much distressed: and as the school is now to consist of girls, a tenderness for her, in her present situation, induces us to recommend her."

† In this school I saw a report of Mr. Archdeacon Wight, Sept. 16th, 1781: "Their beds scandalously dirty, the bed clothes ruinous, torn and filthy, and the children seem much neglected:" And afterwards he adds: "I made a report some time ago to the Committee of Fifteen, much to the same purpose of this, and now find no great alteration for the better."

it seemed not to have been cleaned for six months. Linen much wanted. - Allowance, for soap and candles only £4: fuel £8: mistress £12: usher £6: maid-servant £5. - Meat was roasting for the mistress's dinner at five in the afternoon. Such late hours kept by the master and mistress in the evening, must produce late morning hours, to the children.

[Longford County.]

Longford School. July 9th, 1787, forty-one boys. The house ruinous: the walk very dirty: linen much wanted: the kitchen and infirmary often overflowed in winter. - The master allows for the children's work, but says he has nothing for them to do.* - Twelve boys lately came hither from Castlecarbery school, half starved and almost naked: one of them an idiot.

At my last visit the house was repaired, and the school in order. - April 24th, 1788, 44 Boys.†

[L. Derry County.]

Ballykelly School. July 16th, 1787, twenty-eight boys; seven girls. Bedding much wanted: no coverlids. - The committee of fifteen now clothe the children of all the schools. Here I first saw the clothing: for boys, a brown cloth coat and waistcoat with yellow trimming, two pair of linen breeches, two shirts, three pair of stockings, three pair of shoes: - for girls, cloth jacket and petticoat, two shifts, two aprons, two caps, two pair of stockings, two pair of pumps, but no hats nor handkerchiefs.‡ Allowance for soap and candles £4: 10: 0 - fuel £6. - Here the rent of the land has been raised. On the 29th of June 1787, the master received an account of the increased allowance, and alteration in the dietary mentioned below.‖

* In a report of the local committee are these words, "We find the children in general too small to make their labour of any value, a stop having been put to the old work of the boys, spinning, as it was found prejudicial to their health - May 30th, 1787."

† A boy who was lately put apprentice was found here, returning to his parents; and in my tours I have seen others who had left their masters; some of whom said, their masters were gone off to England. Would it not be better for the Society to put out none to apprenticeships under thirteen years of age, and to give an apprentice fee of £5? Then they might procure masters for them among creditable tradesmen. Should not also the local committee be desired to make their report once a year of the behaviour of the apprentices, and their masters, and to prosecute such masters as abuse their apprentices, or turn them off without sufficient reason?

‡ Report at a meeting of the local committee. "29th of June 1787. The clothes that have been sent down are of a very bad quality, and made quite too small; particularly, the waistcoats for the large boys don't cover half the children's bellies, and of course, will not wear half the time they otherwise would."

"Schools in general. - Resolved, that the allowance to the masters for feeding the several persons in the charter schools be increased to two-pence halfpenny per day for each person; said increased allowance to commence from the 25th of March last.

Ray School. July 17th, 1787, twenty-one boys; thirteen girls. Kitchen small and dirty. - Only seven beds for boys and seven for girls. - The children here as in many other schools without shoes and stockings: tolerably healthy. - A letter similar to that below respecting the alteration in the dietary, was received here the 1st of July.

The advance of the rent of the Society's land occasions a general discontent. On this subject I shall copy, in a note, the reports of the local committee, and that of the committee of fifteen.*

"Dietary. The society pursuant to the committee of fifteen's resolution of the 23d instant, referred to them, this day took into consideration the report of the select committee appointed to consider of the state of the dietary of children in the charter schools; the same being now read and maturely considered;"

"Resolved, that the first paragraph in the present dietary be amended as follows, viz. that one pound and a quarter of oatmeal, or one and a quarter of wheat meal, or an equivalent of potatoes being 4½lb. with one quart and half a pint of milk or beer each day, is judged sufficient for the children one with another; to this must be added 10oz. of flesh meat on each Sunday, and as much on some other day of the week to be fixed by the local committee, when meat does not exceed two-pence by the pound; and when it exceeds that price, on Sundays only, and on succeeding days broth thickened with oatmeal, and wholesome vegetables shreddedd small.

"Resolved, that the second paragraph of the dietary be amended by striking out the following words, or an equal quantity of new milk and water."

By order, for Mr. Thomas Gibbons, &c.

Geo. Gordon.

* "At a meeting of the local committee of the charter school at Ray the 1st of Feb. 1786, being duly and timely warned by the master for that purpose. - We are of opinion that the value of land here is a guinea per acre." (Signed by four clergymen.)

"At a meeting of the local committee 25th July 1786, being duly and timely warned by the master for that purpose. (Signed by three gentlemen Mr. Rea, Mr. Boyd, Mr. Mac Cusland). Though upon the last report of the local committee, lands in this neighbourhood were valued at a guinea per acre, yet upon inspecting the school lands very minutely, we do not apprehend they are worth, to a farmer, more than 15s. per acre, and we are of opinion the master ought to have them cheaper.

"At a meeting. &c. 27th of September 1786, being duly and timely warned.

"We request the committee will order the children's yearly clothing as soon as possible, as they are in great need of them. We think that the intention of the committee to raise the master's rent to sixteen pounds yearly is oppressive, and more than he can pay; however he is willing to submit the rent to the determination of two farmers, who shall on oath declare what the land is worth. We inclose the doctor's bill, which we request may for this time be paid. Should the committee think his charges too high, they may discontinue him.

"July 6th, 1787, being duly and timely warned. - (Signed by four clergymen and one gentleman.) We think that the charter school farm, which we have this day carefully examined, is too dear at sixteen shillings per acre, nor ought it to be set for more than twelve shillings to the master of the school; as he cannot make any permanent improvements on it, on account of the uncertainty of his term." - The land was raised from £6 to £16. - At a committee of fifteen of the Incorporated Society &c. held on Wednesday the nth of 44 October 1786, James Ford, Esq. in the chair.

[Charter Schools.]

[Louth County.]

Dundalk School. July 21st, 1787, forty girls. The house clean, but the children seemed by their countenances to be scandly fed: pantry empty. - Allowance now two-pence halfpenny a day. - Linen wanted: no towels: no table cloths: only one sheet on a bed. Here, and at a few other schools, there is no land.

[Down County.]

Strangford School. July 23d, 1787, twenty boys. Children healthy: here they have the advantage of frequently bathing in the sea. - Salary to master and mistress £12: maid-servant £5: soap* and candles £5: coals £14. The infirmary is used as a stable.

[Mayo County.]

Castlelar School is situated on a fine eminence just out of the town. No pump: no vault. Sept. 12th, 1787, the master received from the Dublin nursery five girls, and from that of Monastereven nine, several of them without shoes or stockings. At my visit March 31st, 1788, there were twenty girls, and the number had not been greater for a year past; though in the account which the society last published, the number on the 29th of Sept. 1787 is stated forty-one. - These children were puny, sickly objects, almost naked; seven had scald heads, and almost all the itch. With these disorders they came; and having no clothes but such as were in rags, the apothecary was afraid to give them physic. The master said they could not earn him a halfpenny. They had never been at church since they came. The following is an extract from a letter sent to the society in Dublin, signed by six gentlemen of the local committee and the surgeon - "2d of Nov. 1787. The clothes of the 12th of June are of so bad a quality that the children who have been here since Nov. 1786 are now naked, and unable to attend the church. A set of sheeting is much wanted." No answer to this was received from the society at Dublin till the Friday before my visit, and then only a printed receipt for the cure of scald heads. - In the society's accounts, published for several years, it is said, "This school was endowed by Lord Lucan with two acres, plantation measure, rent free in perpetuity; and a lease of twenty acres more, like measure, for three lives, at a pepper-corn yearly." On reading this to the master, he said, he never heard of more than about eight acres, which were in his possession.

[Ballinrobe School.]

Ballinrobe School. March 31st, 1788, twenty-five boys. Fourteen of these came from the nursery at Monastereven, and eight from that of Dublin, in a sickly state. - Most of them were eight years old, yet did not know a letter: now they are fine healthy boys, and great attention is paid to them by the Rev. Mr. Viridite the visitor. - The boys having no place for their diversions except the spot of ground before the door, and the house adjoining being a popish chapel, this spot, and also the garden, should be enclosed by a wall. The children in these schools are continually associating with the master's labourers and others in the kitchen; and therefore it seems that little benefit can be derived

* I have in these remarks seldom omitted to mention the allowance for soap, that necessary article of cleanliness, because it is too small in these schools; and this is an inducement to preserve the urine for washing the children's linen, which is one cause of cutaneous disorders.

from them in those counties where all the neighbours are Roman-Catholics. Allowance, for soap and candles only £3: fuel £15: for mending windows 5s. - No water: no vault.

[Galway County.]

Galway School. April 1st, 1788, twenty-two boys; one an idiot. - All had shoes and stockings; but in general they did not look healthy, which might be owing to their late recovery from the measles. - Allowance for soap, candles and turf, only £14 a year. - No towels. - The house in good repair, but wanted white-washing. This is a good situation for a bath.*

[Loughrea School.]

Loughrea School. April 3d, 1788, forty girls. These dirty, sickly objects, without shoes and stockings, were spinning and knitting in a cold room paved with pebbles. The usher stood (as at some other schools) with a rod in his hand, to see the children work; but there was not a book to be seen. There were only sixteen beds - sheets much wanted - the infirmary, a potatoe house. - The children were sadly neglected by their drunken mistress. But I observed that her own children, by the fire side, were fresh and clean.

To this school, where there are only girls, there belongs much arable land. Here, at Castlebar, and at some other schools, the farm-yards are close to the back doors, and so dirty that one can hardly stir out.

[Clare County.]

Newmarket School. April 4th 1788, eighteen girls and fourteen. boys. The rooms clean - white linen on the beds - the children clean, and free from disorders. The master does not live in the school-house.

[Limerick County.]

Shannon Grove School. April 5th, 1788, eighty-seven children. Here as at Newmarket, Castle Martyr, Castle Island, Sligo, and some other schools, boys and girls are intermixed, which on many accounts is improper. The house was badly built, and is so much out of repair that part of it must be taken down.† The bed rooms were clean; the children dirty; but seemed to be properly fed. The boys were spinning, an employment which can be of little advantage to them when they are grown up; and the confinement within doors, with the waste of saliva by moistening the flax, make it unhealthy, and give them a pale or sallow complexion. The church is about two miles distant. - Here, and at several other schools, I found some leaves of the visitors' book torn out.

* At Galway and Ennis I visited the schools of Erasmus Smith's foundation, which are well conduced, and provided with able masters. With the worthy master of the former, the Rev. Mr. Campbell, I had much convention relative to a more general and liberal mode of education in that country. Mr. Campbell testified the readiness of many of the catholics to send their children to protestant schools; and he is of opinion that many would by these means be brought over, were the most promising of them enabled, by moderate aids, to pursue their further education in the university. It might also be adviseable to remove from the charter schools some of the most improved children to these schools, or such provincial ones as might be established.

† The school-houses in general are good strong buildings, on a proper plan, and well adapted to the purpose.

110 IRELAND. Sect. VII.

[Charter Schools.]

[Kerry County.]

Castle Island School; April 8th, 1788, eleven girls and ten boys. The rooms clean: the children not dirty, but kept too close to work, and scantily fed. - Formerly their learning was neglected, but now they have a careful visitor.

About three acres of the land belonging to this school was taken away in the time of the late master, as he informed the present master: of this the society has not yet taken any notice. - In the postscript of a letter to the master, 25th of July 1787, are these words, "Do not draw at less than thirty-one days sight." But the master told me he could readily have got the money for the bills at a shorter date.

[Limerick County.]

Kilfinane School. April 10th, 1788, nineteen girls, all neat and clean, spinning and sewing. - The mistress was allowed for the clothing of each £1: 5: 0. They had shoes and stockings, brown stuff gowns with yellow sleeves, white caps and bibs, and check aprons. This is the best charter school for girls that I have seen. The house is inconvenient. - No vault.†

[Tipperary County.]

Cashell School. April 12th, 1788, forty boys. The bed rooms offensive: clay floors. The kitchen, in which the children dine and sup, is dark, and has a floor of dirt. Allowance only for one maid: no usher. - The children neat, but the master justly complained of the shoes and stockings, and that the shirts were too small; the clothes poor and slight, and the breeches too short

[Kildare County.]

Castledermot School. April 15th, 1788, twenty-seven boys. The report of the local committee on the 14th of April 1788 (the day immediately preceding my visit) was, that "the children are all well, except one sick of the ague, and the house clean:" but I observed that some had scald heads; and the mistress acknowledged that eight of them had that disorder. The rooms were dirty. On each of the eight beds there was only one sheet, and on the other bedsteads hardly any bedding. The house out of repair - the walls very dirty - the children sadly neglected - the master only seventeen or eighteen years of age. No diet table; nor had the mistress, as she told me, ever heard of any. She enjoys an annuity of £10 a year, from a estate left to the incorporated society by John Rogerson Esq. of Bettifield.

[Queen's County.]

Stradbally School. April 15th, 1788, forty-nine fine healthy boys. The bed rooms clean, and furnished with sheets and proper bedding: but no usher, and only one maid-servant. - Allowance for soap and candles £5; and only 5s. a year for mending the widows of this large house.

* I shall here beg leave to put two or three queries to the Trustees of Erasmus Smith's charity schools, relative to this county. 1. Is not a sum of money allowed by them for a school in the isle of Valentia, in the county of Kerry? 2. How is it applied? 3. Is not a blacksmith the nominal master? 4. Is not the late Mr. Fitzgerald's house the school-house? 5. Is not the salary continued to his executors for the use of his children?

† I visited a small girls' school of Lady Kingsborough's at Mitchells Town, where the house and children were sweet and clean. The girls were neatly clothed in brown camlet gowns. They shewed, both by their reading and their work, that great attention is paid to them. It is probable that the mistress at Kilfinane has seen this school, and I wish it were regarded in some respects as a model for other charter schools.

Sect. VII. IRELAND. 111

[Charter Schools.]

[Stradbally School.]

I found this in 1782 one of the best schools for boys. The worthy clergyman Mr. Foster is still assiduous in his attention to them. Formerly the boys were well clothed by the master; but at the time of my visit, he had just received an inferior sort of clothes from the society. These clothes should have been sent on the 20th of January. On the 3d of April, no clothes having arrived, thirteen gentlemen of the local committee resigned their trust, in a letter sent by Lord Roden to the committee of fifteen.

[Sligo County.]

Sligo School. April 20th, 1788, twenty-four boys and thirteen girls. The house finely situated; - but it seemed to me that the children are not properly fed, and that there is too little attention given to their morals and behaviour. Here were only three cows: the home close was ploughed, and part of the garden sown with wheat. The late Adam Ormsby Esq. bequeathed £35 per annum for ever, towards the support of this school, out of his estates; but for several years no payment has been made.

[West Meath County.]

Farra School. April 25th, 1788, twenty-five boys. The house, bed rooms, and children very dirty: their clothes in rags: water too distant: their countenances shew their sickly state.* - Many of them so young that the charge for their labour is a heavy burden on the master, and furnishes him with an excuse for pinching them in their diet.

[Meath County.]

Ardbraccan School,† April 25th, 1788, forty-three boys crowded into one room which is too small. The house also is too small for the number which, in the printed

* I am persuaded, if the inspectors took proper care that attention should be paid to cleanliness, that the beds should not be crowded, and that the sick should be sent to the infirmary room, the children would be much more healthy, and there would be little occasion for medicines.

† When I visited this school in 1782, and compared its state with the society's account of their schools published in 1781, the master informed me, that his school had greatly suffered by an exchange of part of his land for the convenience of the rector. I viewed the ground, and was then fully persuaded of the injury done to the charity. In 1788 I carefully reviewed those parts of the land which had been exchanged, and am confirmed in my opinion, that neither to accommodate the rector, nor to oblige the bishop of Meath, that unjust, and (if the society's account of their title to the land published in 1781 were truly stated‡) illegal exchange should have been made by the incorporated society. The land taken from the society being contiguous to their other fields, had been enclosed, by the late master; and it was near three acres (Irish) more than that which they received in exchange.

‡ No.I. ARDBRACCAN, County or MEATH.

"This school, wherein are fifty children, was endowed by the Right Rev. Dr. Maule, former Lord Bishop of Meath, deeded, with two acres of land, plantation measure, rent-free in perpetuity, belonging to the See, on part whereof the school-house is built: His Lordship also granted to the society a lease of eighteen acres more, contiguous to the same, at 5s. per acre per annum, for which he took no rent during his incumbency, and always renewed without fine, and his Lordship gave £20 and collected £246: 7: 6 towards the building."

"The Right Reverend and Honourable Dr. Henry Maxwell, Lord Bishop of Meath, upon the society's application for further aid, had been pleased to propose either to grant a renewal of the present lease, without fine, or to grant a new lease upon such terms as his Lordship is empowered to do by a clause in the act of parliament, passed in the eighth year of his present Majesty's reign, for licensing hawkers and pedlars, and for the encouragement of English protestant schools, which latter proposal the society did agree most thankfully to accept. And his Lordship has in consequence, granted a lease for lives renewable for ever, of said lands to the society. N.B. The master pays the society 12s. per acre for the lands."

account, it is said to be capable of containing. Neither the house, bedding, nor children clean: four or five lay sick on the floor in the school room. - No diet table, nor did the master know of any. - No infirmary.

[Meath County.]

Trim School. April 25th, 1788, thirty-nine girls. The house was clean, and the children in health, but badly clothed. - The bread very bad. - A pump of fine water. - No infirmary. - Extract from a report in the book; "7th October 1786. This school has been in a melancholy situation these three months past, which in all probability might not have gone farther than the first child which was took ill, were there a detached room from the school for such children, which the committee most earnestly recommend to the society to build, as it might be done at a very small expence." The answer to this recommendation was; "15th Nov. 1786, the local committee be informed, that this committee cannot agree to the building of an infirmary at the school, as the funds of the society are exceedingly straitened, and require every species of oeconomy."*

[Kildare County.]

Castle Carbery School. April 26th, 1788, thirty-seven girls. Many of them were making lace (see note in p. 75). The walls of the rooms very dirty - children not clean - several had sore heads - no infirmary. The bad state of this school might in a great measure be owing to the master who was lately dismissed, for I was informed, that half the children were then almost naked. - There having been many removals of masters lately made, the sickly appearance of the children which I observed in some schools, did not always proceed from the neglect or inattention of the matters or mistresses who had the management of the schools at the time I visited them.

[Maynooth School.]

Maynooth School. April 26th, 1788, thirty-five fine healthy boys. The house, bed rooms, and bedding perfectly clean. Ten or twelve boys were at work in the garden, which contains about three acres (Irish), and is kept in the nicest order by the master and his boys.† Allowance for diet 3d. a day. No infirmary; which is less necessary where boys are thus employed.

[Wicklow County.]

Arklow School. May 2d, 1788, forty-nine girls. They seemed to be properly fed; but little attention is paid to cleanliness; several had scald heads. - Allowance for soap and candles only £5. - The society's clothes were in rags. Extract from the

* If the society's funds are too low for the proper support of all the schools, would it not be better that some were suppressed? And if the suppression of any be necessary, they should be those which are attended with the most inconveniences - such as the inconveniences attending a house out of repair, and a bad supply of water; and those arising from situations too remote from the capital, and a church, or where the neighbours are all Roman-Catholics, and there is little probability of a proper inspection. I will add that if any should be suppressed, the children might be sent to some of the best schools where the numbers are deficient.

† The boys in all the schools should be taught to plant, sow, rear trees &c. proper utensils for this purpose should be provided for them by the society, and a part of every garden should be set apart as a nursery for their instruction.

report of Sir Francis Hutchinson, one of the committee of fifteen. "I see that at least half of the gowns are so small as not to be sufficient to protect the girls from cold, and some of them have been torn in endeavouring to make them cover their shoulders or breasts. I see that about sixteen, that is half of them, have the itch, and some of these have it to a very considerable degree. 29th August 1787. F. Hutchinson." The contract for clothing is still continued with the same person. - The infirmary is used for a pig sty: no vault. I am sorry to find no report of this last defect in any even of the girls' schools.*

[Wexford County.]

New Ross School. May 3d, 1788, twenty-six boys, and eleven girls. Some of the children wore the society's clothes, which were bad in every respect: the others wore the master's, made of good warm cotton, spun in the house. - Here was plenty of provisions, and the children were properly fed; and by hearing some of different standings read, I found that greater attention is paid to their learning than in most of the schools. A girl, who had her education and served an apprenticeship in this house, is now teacher; but has no emolument from the society. The mistress told me, she had lately received six very sickly boys from Dublin.

[Cork County.]

Innishannon School. May 8th, 1788, thirty-three boys; one an idiot. The house out of repair: the children very dirty, and their clothes in rags. Several had the itch, and some, scald heads. Allowance for soap and candles £4: fuel £15. The instruction of the children is much neglected, though the school is provided with an usher. By order of the local committee, the children had not been at church for several months.†

On the 8th of May, I found the following report made but two days before by a physician who was one of the local committee. "All the boys now healthy." On seeing him, I expressed to him my surprise at such a report, and shewed him the state of several of the children. - His reply was, "We do not call the itch and scald head, sickness."‡ This committee has recommended the master of the school to a premium. If there were here a just attention to cleanliness, the committee would not probably be obliged by a fever in the school to meet, as they did lately, for the purpose of making a report, at a private house.

[Dunmanway School.]

Dunmanway School. May 9th, 1788, thirty-nine boys, and three girls. The house out of repair: the infirmary a ruinous loft: no pump. Allowance, £4 a year for a man and horse to fetch water - Soap only £2: fuel £10. The children were objects of

* I generally asked the master or mistress, if the children's work paid the society's charge? Every one said, I lose greatly by the work. The society now neither find new spinning wheels, nor pay for mending the old ones.

† It was owing to the shameful contract made by the committee of fifteen at Dublin, that they were without shoes and stockings; for many of the shoes (which I saw) were so small as to be quite useless, and the stockings broke into holes on the first day's wearing.

‡ That this opinion concerning the scald head is not general, will appear in a report under the account of the Connaught nursery, where children are stated to have died of it.

compassion, dirty end sickly; all without shoes and stockings; many of the boys without breeches; some almost naked. In one of the bed rooms there were nine beds, in the other only three, and all very dirty.* The master excused himself from going with me into the bed rooms, by saying that he was afraid of catching a disorder; the mistress also had her fears; though the rooms were empty, having only one child in them who happened then to be ll of an ague. The humane and faithful committee lately reported, that "the children are healthy, and taken proper care of, and we recommend the master and mistress as deserving the society's bounty." Here, and at most of the schools, the masters are ordered to draw for their money at twenty-one, thirty-one, and sometimes forty-one days aight, which is inconvenient to them though they charge the discount. In one of the bills which I saw, this charge was £1: 1: 7½ besides 10s. for sending a man and horse to receive it.

[Cork County.]

Castle-Martyr School May 15th, 1788, twenty-one boys, and fifteen girls. The school house (built in 1748 as appears by the inscription over the door) has lately been thoroughly repaired. The bed rooms were not dirty; and the countenances of the children shew that they are properly fed; but they are not kept dean. Allowance, for soap and candles £5: fuel £10: servant-maid £5. Though this school has an usher (paid by the master) there seems to be little attention to the children's instruction, for several of four or five years standing could not read. There was not a testament in the house. - Here also the master complained of the badness of the society's clothes.

[Athlone Ranelagh School.]

Athlone Ranelagh School. At both the Ranelagh schools there are only the children of protestants: of this an affidavit must be made by their parents or nearest relations before a magistrate. July 8th 1787, here were forty boys. The rooms full of fleas: the boys dirty: no towels: no water: no vault. Here, and at the other schools which I visited, the salutary practice of lime-whiting is not adopted; nor can any of the upper sashes be let down. Allowance to the usher £7 and a child's maintenance. Two maid-servants £5 each: soap and candles £7: fuel £10: clothing here £1: 19: 3 each. Allowance for diet £3: 2: 6, and the deduction for the work of three-fourths of the children as in other schools; though by a letter of the 9th of May 1787, the society mentions "that the present income of the Ranelagh fund does considerably exceed the annual expenses." In 1788, I found the boys dirty and ragged, and employed in

* The bolsters here and in several other schools were so matted with dirt, that probably, they convey the infection of scald heads. - The great Capt. Cook in his paper read to the Royal Society on the method taken for preserving the health of his crew, informs us of his care to keep their "persons, hammocks, bedding, clothes, &c. constantly clean;" - "that he was not satisfied with ordering upon deck the hammocks and bedding every day that was fair, but took care that each bundle should be unlashed, and so spread out that every part of it might be exposed to the air."

carrying heavy loads of dung to a lighter. The children in general did not appear cheerful. The master was dead, and his son, totally unqualified, and only eighteen years, of age, had been appointed to this important charge. April 19th, 1788, 40 Boys.*

[Roscommon Ranelagh School.]

Roscommon Ranelagh School, July 8th, 1787, forty girls. In this and the other Ranelagh school the situation of the children is changed - the girls being now where there is much arable land, and the boys where there is little or none. Here are two acres of garden ground in which boys might be well employed.

The house was clean: the girls neat. Allowance for soap and candles only £6 a year. No towels: no pump. A new infirmary is left unfinished. A contract was made for new sashes for the house and for building the infirmary, and the carpenter began the work the 4th of October 1786 by order of the committee of fifteen, but not having received any part of the payment, he was arrested and put into prison for £11: 10: 2 and the work was at a stand.† Diet here and at Athlone now three-pence a day for each. At my last visit the girls were spinning and knitting. The bed room was clean, but the children were not. The master's mother (old and infirm) was the mistress. April 20th, 1788, forty Girls.

[Nurseries.]

Besides the Schools, there are four Nurseries for the reception of children under the age of six years. One of these nurseries is near Dublin, and the other three are called Provincial Nurseries. I visited them with peculiar attention, as the tender age of the children renders them incapable of struggling with hardships, or making complaints.

[Miltown-Road.]

At Miltown-Road Nursery near Dublin, June 6th, 1787, there were of both sexes thirty-three children, many of them unhealthy. No diet table, nor rules hung up.

* In the local-committee's book, are these words: "At a meeting, 21st of January 1767, thirteen gentlemen present - having seen a dietary given to the schoolmaster by Mr. Lloyd, signed by order, Thomas Gibbons, his excellency Thomas Ponsonby in the chair. - It is the opinion of this committee that the allowance of meal set forth in the dietary is too small, and that not less than 1½lb. of meal is sufficient for the support of the children each day, having seen one pound of meal weighed and baked. And not less than one quart of new milk, or three pints of skimmed milk or buttermilk will be sufficient for each boy or girl."

"Resolved, that it is the opinion of this committee, that the children be put on due allowance of 1½lb. of meal to each, and the resolution of the committee of fifteen be farther known."

This was not confirmed by the committee of fifteen.

† The reports of the local committee are as follows: "19th of May 1787, Resolved, that it is our opinion that the sum of £20 ought to be ordered to enable the undertaker to pursue the said work, he not having been paid any money hitherto for the said sashes and said infirmary." And the "29th of June, 1787, Resolved, that the resolution of this committee of the 19th of May, recommending £20 to be paid to the undertaker of the new sashes for the school-house, and rebuilding the infirmary, not having been attended to, was the occasion of the said undertaker's being arrested and actually lodged in gaol; and this committee strongly recommend that the said sum of £20 and a farther sum of £15 be ordered to the master to be by him paid over to the said undertaker, he having done work equivalent to that amount, viz. the sashes made up, and the infirmary wall built."

I observed an excessive parsimony in linen, soap, and other things necessary for cleanliness and health. March 18th, 1788, 24 Children; eight had scald heads, and one the evil.

[Leinster Nursery.]

Leinster Nursery, at Monastereven. June 25th, 1787, there were seventy-eight children. Their ages, as in Miltown nursery, from two to six years. The bed rooms and stairs not clean: bedding bad: sheets, as at most of the schools, brown linen, which hides dirt and never seems clean. Allowance to master and mistress £10 each; soap and candles, £12. Fuel only £14. Diet formerly 1¼d. a day each child, now 2¼d.* Master's dinner-time five o'clock. He calls himself an apothecary, and was lately paid six guineas for medicines. The impropriety of thus vetting the power of an apothecary and of the master in one man, appears too plainly from the uncommon mortality among the children.

April 16th, 1788, there were seventy-five children, all crowded into one room or hall; the room opposite to it, and intended for a school or dining-room, being used only for a bake-house. The children very dirty, and their hair not kept properly combed. Fourteen or fifteen had scald heads, though in these nurseries, the society allows a maid servant for every ten children. Many whose ages were from two to four years were loaded with heavy and improper clothing. The youngest children are allowed only three meals a day. At the time I visited them they were dining at three o'clock on potatoes, not properly boiled: five or six of the most sickly dined on a piece of new half-baked cake or bread; but the drink of all of them was sour butter-milk. The master (who thinks he understands physic) gives, as he says, to every child, sulphur and-milk in the morning, and intends to anoint them all for the itch. In his bill for the last quarter there were these articles, viz.

£. S. D.

Eleven coffins and grave digger - 2 12 3

Sundries for upwards of eighty children in the fever and hooping cough, such as wine, wine-whey &c. &c. - 4 11 0

Diet and wages, nurse tender for thirteen weeks attending the children in the fever and hooping cough - 3 18 6

When I inspected the children in 1787, I plainly saw they were improperly managed; this led me to doubt of the master's medical skill, and to observe to him that an attention to cleanliness and diet is more necessary than physic. Nor has my doubt been

* The following letter had lately been received here from the society. "At a general meeting of the incorporated society &c. held on Wednesday the 30th of May 1787, his Grace the Lord Archbishop of Cashell in the chair, Resolved, that it appears to this board, that the present allowance to the children in the three provincial nurseries, is insufficient, and that it is necessary to encrease the said allowance to 2¼d. per day to commence from the 25th of March last."

removed by the following curious report lately made by the local committee, viz. "This committee apprehend there must be some mistake in the information given to the committee of fifteen, relative to the matter's want of skill in administering of drugs, as he has this day been examined on oath before this committee; when he solemnly declared, that he was never examined, or in any manner questioned, relative to his skill in medicine by any person whatsoever, since he became master of this nursery." - He complained to me of the inconvenience of being obliged to draw for his quarterly bills at twenty-one, thirty-one, and forty-one days date.

[Munster Nursery.]

Munster Nursery, at Shannon Grove, is a large, well built house, properly adapted for a school-house. April 5th, 1788, there were ninety-one children. They are not kept properly clean. They had not been washed, or combed, the day I was there: many had the itch: and I observed other cutaneous eruptions on their heads, necks and hands. Six had died the last quarter of 1787; nine since; and there were fourteen in the infirmary. The allowance for diet now being 2¼d. a day, I hope the children will no longer be fed with skimmed milk. Here also the quarterly bills are paid at three payments, at twenty-one, thirty-one and forty-one days date, and the discount is charged to the society.

[Connaught Nursery.]

Connaught Nursery, at Monrvea. April 2d, 1788, there were twenty-two children, most of them from two to four years of age, in a very sickly condition, with the itch, scald heads, and sore eyes: some lay groveling in the turf ashes. One (brought in about six months before, and recommended by counsellor Marsh) never could stand; another being very lame, used crutches; and I was told of a third, who seemed ill, that be had been sent hither because he did not thrive with his parents." The children lay in a large cold room, which extends the whole length of the house. The young creatures, on coming from warm cabins, should not be put immediately into such rooms, but be inured to them by degrees. In a report, Jan. 2d, 1786, it is said, that "three have died lately of scald-heads, and several others are ill of the same complaint." And May 19th, 1787, "On Wednesday last, notwithstanding our repeated directions with respect to the children's diet, we found that at their breakfast of ftirabout, small beer in a very sour, unwholesome state was given them; and from the late ill health of some of the children, and the present feeble state of more, we apprehend such drink has been too often substituted for milk." The master, very properly, was soon after dismissed, and a young couple from Dublin are now sent; but, from a view of the children and the management of them, I am led to suspect the society has not changed much for the better. Salary to the master and mistress 20. Allowance, for soap and candles £8: fuel £22: 10: 0. The water is at a mile's distance.

The visitor lives about a mile and half distant. It seems that sometimes he makes his report from his own house; for, on the back of one account sent to the master,. he wrote "send the copy of this to Dublin, and keep this for me." The committee room is a granary for the visitor's oats.

[Remarks on Charter Schools.]

To the remarks I hare already made on the Charter Schools which I visited, it will not be improper to add the following hints for their improvement.

In the diet table the quantity and quality should be fixed for every day in the week. - The master and mistress should attend the children at their meals, and dine within half an hour of their time, that the business of the house be not interrupted, and late hours introduced among the children. - The regulations for masters - children - and servants, should be printed on a board and hung up; and the bell rung at the times of rising, prayers, meals &c.

To every fifteen children there should be one maid-servant; and in large schools, there should be a cook, who ought also to manage the dairy. The whole of Saturday should be appropriated to cleanliness. There should be a larger allowance for soap, starch, candles and fuel; and proper utensils for cleaning the rooms. - The children's linen constantly changed twice a week. - A crib bedstead for every two children at most, and single beds for the sick children. In the master's or mistress' bed room a window to look into the children's dormitory. An infirmary in every house, with beds and proper bedding kept neat. - Every house once a year to be lime-whited, that is, washed with boiling water in which fresh lime-stone has been flaked.* The sashes of the windows both upper and under should be moveable. - A dairy and pantry in every house: a pump is necessary: a convenient bath: a proper vault with separations: the master to keep only one dog: no pigs nor fowls ever to enter the house. - The master and mistress to accompany the children to and from church, and sit with them there. - The time for the children's work not to exceed four hours a day, and the masters and mistresses not to be charged for it. - Large and neat gardens for a supply of vegetables, instruction and work for the boys. - The girls to be employed in spinning and knitting, in

* I have often mentioned the want of lime-whiting in the prisons, hospitala and schools in this country, when they appeared to me very dirty; as it is attended with little expense, is exceedingly salutary, and tends to inspire young persons in particular with a love of cleanliness. Of this last circumstance, I am convinced from experience in somewhat similar instances; as I have repeatedly observed, that when I have pulled down old cottages that had clay floors, and no pantry, no pump, no outhouse for fuel, nor any vault, and have built new ones with these conveniences, which have also been white-washed both within and without the very same families that were before slovenly and dirty, have, upon this change of their habitations, become clean and neat in their persons, in their houses, and gardens. - It was in consequence of these observations, made during my residence on my estate in Bedfordshire, that the clause for white-washing gaols was inserted in the act for preserving the health of prisoners. - In addition to what has been said with regard to cleanliness, it maybe observed, that when quick lime is flaked in boiling water, and immediately used, it not only destroys vermin, but is found to be one of the strongest antiseptics. In confirmation of this fact, I shall take the liberty of mentioning a remarkable instance of its efficacy in this respect. Dr. John Hope, the first physician to the royal infirmary at Edinburgh, informed me in one of my visits there, that two or three years before, a putrid fever had prevailed in that hospital, and that one large ward in particular was so deeply infected, as to prove fatal, for some time, to the patients that were lodged in it; but that lime-whiting the walls had eradicated the infection, after washing the ward repeatedly with vinegar had failed of this effect; and that this salutary practice had been continued ever since.

Sect. VII. IRELAND. 119

[Remarks on Charter Schools.]

making and mending their linen, and in assisting in all kinds of household work. - Masters and mistresses to be prohibited from selling milk, butter and cheese.

As the society's lands are out of condition, every master's expense in improving them with lime, marle &c. should be fully reimbursed by the local committee, in case of his dismission or death.

The protestant gentlemen, within ten miles of a school, should be earnestly requested to be of the local committee, and to make frequent visits to it. - The ladies within the same distance should also be desired to favour the schools with their visits; and both should make their remarks in a book kept for that purpose.

The local committee should be permitted to give stipulated premiums to the most cleanly, orderly and diligent children, and those who make the best improvement. This to be done with a proper degree of applause, addressing them in such a manner as may tend to excite their emulation, and this before persons whom the children most respect; and the names of those children who obtained the premiums should be written in the visitors' book, and sent to the committee of fifteen in Dublin.

The committee of fifteen should pay the greatest attention to the remarks of a local committee.

Some of these remarks were made in my former publication, but being more fully convinced of their importance, they are now repeated. The alterations proposed may be thought too expensive; but I am persuaded that the penuriousness of the society in providing diet, clothing &c. which has been long observed by those who visit the children, or see them at church, has considerably reduced the subscriptions: and these improvements would probably recover and increase them. They would at least retrieve the credit of the society, and do honour to the protestant cause.

I cannot forbear here expressing a wish that the benefits of education were more generally extended over Ireland, than they are by these schools. If free-schools were instituted in every parish for instructing in the lower parts of learning, and the principles of morality, children of each sex, and of all persuasions; it would perhaps more than any thing tend to soften the manners of the Irish poor, and enable their youth to resist the various temptations to vice, to which they are inevitably exposed in their crowded huts and cabins.

The lower class of people in Ireland are by no means averse to the improvement of their children. At the cabins on the road side I saw several schools, in which, for the payment of 3s. 3d. Irish per quarter, children were instructed in reading, writing and accounts. Some of these I examined as to their proficiency, and found them much forwarder than those of the same age in the charter schools. They were clean and wholesome, and consisted of the children of both protestant and catholic parents. I hope I shall not be thought, as a protestant dissenter, indifferent to the protestant cause, when I express my wish, that these distinctions were less regarded in bestowing the advantages of education; and that the increase of protestantism were chiefly trusted to the dissemination of knowledge and sound morals.

[Remarks on Charter Schools.]

In Scotland, almost every village has its settled school-master; the beneficial effects of which are evident: for it is principally owing to this, that the numerous emigrants from that country, dispersed over almost all Europe, appear with credit, and advance themselves in their several stations.* The Sunday schools lately established by the benevolence of the public, in so many parts of England, will doubtless in some degree produce similar good effects; if the benefactors abate not of their zeal and attention. But no plan that I have seen for the extended instruction of the poor seems more judiciously calculated for the purpose, than one lately instituted by the trustees of the Blue-coat Hospital, in the

* In Dr. Johnson's Sermon to the Society in Scotland for propagating christian knowledge, published in 1786, he informs us, that "about seven thousand poor children are instructed in their different schools, in reading, writing, arithmetic, the principles of the christian religion, and the useful arts." In a summary account, published in 1783 by this exemplary society are these words: "The whole annual revenue of the Society in Scotland does not exceed £2000, of which there is not above £1500 applicable to their great object, the propagation of religion in the Highlands and Islands; yet on this small revenue they now maintain about one hundred and eighty schools, and educate about seven thousand young people. The sum is so disproportioned to the object, that it would be impossible for the directors to maintain so great a number of schools, were they not strictly attentive to the state of the parishes, and in requiring the inhabitants, as far as they can afford it, to contribute in part to the support of the schoolmasters, by a small quarterly fee, and especially by furnishing them with a house and school-house, with fuel and a cow's grass: this is no hardship on them, but it is a material aid to the masters: in a few instances, the gentlemen or noblemen in the neighbourhood pay a part or a half of the salary. By such frugal management the directors are enabled to make the charities intrusted to them more generally serviceable than otherwise they could have been."

The greatest part of the schools supported by the society are situated in the most remote parts of the highlands, where the young people have no other means of instruction; for in the low country of Scotland I had the pleasure to find parochial schools, established by law (as I have mentioned in a former publication) which afford to the poorest of the people, an opportunity of giving their children a proper education. - I must still add, what was highly commendable, that the society, desirous of obtaining the fullest information with regard to the situation and circumstances of their schools, and the conduct of their schoolmasters in the highlands and islands, granted a commission to Mr. Lewis Drummond, Lieutenant in the late 115th regiment of foot, in whom they placed a very great confidence, to visit their schools in different parts, and to make an exact report of all the particulars relative thereto, according to instructions given to him for that purpose. Mr. Drummond, in two several visitations (in 1771, 1772) each of which continued for many months, executed this trust with such fidelity, diligence, and zeal, as justified the good opinion which the society entertained of him, and gave them entire satisfaction. He made two distinct and complete reports of these visitations, which conveyed to the society much interesting intelligence, concerning the state, not only of their schools, but of religion in general, in the highlands and islands of Scotland, and suggested to them some material alterations for the improvement of their plan. -

"From Mr. Drummond's reports of the date of their schools, the society have been led to adopt several useful regulations respecting them, to which, as well as to those formerly made, they are determined strictly to adhere. - In order to render their schools as useful as possible, the society have lately revived an old regulation, which requires that they shall be ambulatory, that is, that they shall remain in one place no longer than three years; at the end of which space, they shall be removed to such other stations in the same or adjacent parishes as to the society shall seem meet; provided always, that the conditions above mentioned shall be performed by the inhabitants, who must also be at the expence of transporting the schoolmaster with his family and furniture."

[Remarks on Charter Schools.]

city of Chester, where, to an ancient establishment of an hospital for poor , a charity for the education of a large number of out-scholars has been annexed, and has been productive of the happiest effects, I will therefore here transcribe the following particular account of it.

"Of late years, the whole income of this charity has been expended in the maintenance and education of thirty boys, whom we now call in-scholars. The annual expense of each in-scholar has been about £13, and the education of each boy for four years has cost £52. Such large charitable benefactions being bestowed on a few, a much larger number of boys, equally destitute, have been suffered to grow up to men unemployed and uninstructed."

"In 1781, when the income of the hospital was augmented, it was proposed to educate sixty more boys, as out-scholars, to be taught reading, writing, and some arithmetic; but not to be clothed, maintained, or lodged in the house. This proposal was not accomplished till the autumn of 1783. The improvement of the sixty new scholars in reading, writing, and behaviour, was so remarkable, and so pleasing, that, in December 1784 a proposal was made to double the number, which was unanimously approved by a full and respectable meeting of the trustees. Two masters now teach one hundred and twenty out-scholars. The salary of the first master is £40, and of the second £25, a year. Hence the expense of each out-scholar is 10s. 10d. a year to the master. The annual expense of each boy in books is 1s. 3½d. and in coals 4½d.A green cap, which costs 1s. 6d. is given to each scholar every year. Hence it appears that the whole annual expense of each out-scholar is 14s. Consequently, more money is bestowed on one in-scholar, than would educate eighteen out-scholars.

"A good education is now given to thirty in-scholars, and one hundred and twenty out-scholars, which comprehend above one third of all the boys in Chester. The boys are appointed scholars about nine years old, in order to have their instruction completed about the age of going apprentice. When die out-scholars are of two years standing, fifteen of the best are annually elected in-scholars, for two years; and the boys not thus elected remain two years longer in the out-school.

"It is an interesting truth, which deserves public attention, that two masters can teach one hundred and twenty scholars. At the examination of last April, all the boys who had been two years in the school, though several did not know a letter on their admission, could read and write very well, understood some arithmetic, and had very perfectly learned their catechism."

* Report of the state of the Blue-Coat Hospital, in Chester, from the 1st of May 1786, to the 1st of May 1787.

The following extract from the Considerations on the Chester School contains sentiments which I think very just. "A strange and pernicious prejudice has too generally prevailed, against educating the children

[Ackworth Rules.]

Having in many of the schools I have visited observed, among other irregularities, the rudeness of the boys, and being persuaded that no instruction is given them relative to a decent and becoming deportment, perhaps hints may be taken for their improvement in this respect from some of the rules of the excellent institution of the Quakers, at Ackworth in Yorkshire, for the education of children of their persuasion, which I here copy.

"INSTRUCTIONS TO SCHOOL-MASTERS.

"That the schools, during the summer season, open at half after six o'clock in the morning, and in the winter at half after seven o'clock, and that they close at eight; that after breakfast they open at nine and close at twelve; that after dinner they open at two and close at five. These times to be observed as near as conveniently may be.

"That they observe that the children come into the schools, when the bell rings, in a quiet and becoming manner, with their faces and hands clean, hair combed, and take their seats at the time appointed.

"That the boys be instructed in spelling, reading, and English grammar; that after dinner, the boys who attended the writing masters, shall attend the reading masters; and the lads who attended the reading masters, shall attend the writing masters.

"In order that punishments may be inflicted with coolness and temper, and in proportion to the nature of the offence, the following method is agreed upon, viz. That the treasurer and each master keep a book, and minute down offences committed within the day; that once a week, or oftener, they meet together and inspect these books, and administer such punishments as may be agreed upon; using their endeavours to convince the children that the only purpose of correction is for their amendment, and to deter others from the commission of the like offence.

"That they sit down with the children and family on 1st day (Sunday) evening, reading to them, or causing them to read suitable portions of the holy scriptures, and other religious books, the treasurer and principal master selecting such parts and subjects as are most instructive, and best adapted to their understandings.

"That they in particular endeavour, by divine assistance, to impress upon the minds of the children the necessity of a strict adherence to truth, and abhorrence to falsehood; as well as a remembrance of their Creator in the days of their youth; having the fear of the Lord before their eyes, which will preserve under the various temptations to which they

"of the poor, so as to check the beneficence of the charitable and humane. Some have absurdly maintained, that the most ignorant are the most virtuous, happy, and useful part of mankind. It is astonishing what injurious influence this doctrine has had, though so contrary to common sense and common observation. Let any one recollect the character of bricklayers, joiners, shoemakers and other mechanics, as well as of domestic servants, and he will certainly discover, that the most honest, sober, industrious and useful both to their own families and the public, are those who have been accustomed to attend divine service, and who were instructed, when young, in moral principles, reading, writing, and accompts."

[Ackworth Rules.]

"are incident, and lead to the enjoyment of real happiness, by keeping a conscience void of offence towards God and towards Man."

"General Rules to be strictly observed by all the Boys at Ackworth School, and to be read to them once a Month."

"That they rise at six o'clock in the morning in the summer, and at seven o'clock in the winter, and dress themselves quietly and orderly, endeavouring to begin the day in the fear of the Lord, which is as a fountain of life preserving from the snares of death."

"That they wash their faces and hands, and at the ringing of the bell, collect themselves in order, and come decently into the schools; that they take their seats in a becoming manner, without noise or hurry, and begin business when the master shall direct."

"That they refrain from talking and whispering in the school; and, when repeating their lessons to the master, that they speak audibly and distinctly."

"That they should not be absent from school, nor go out of bounds without leave."

"That when the bell rings for breakfast, dinner or supper, they collect themselves together in silence, and in due order, having their faces and hands washed, their hair combed &c. and so proceed quietly into the dining room: and eat their food decently."

"That they avoid quarrelling, throwing sticks, stones and dirt, striking or teazing one another; and they are enjoined to complain not of trifles; and when at play to observe moderation and decency."

"That they neither borrow, lend, buy, nor exchange without leave, and that they strictly avoid gaming of all kinds; that they never tell a lie, use the sacred name irreverently, nor mock the aged or deformed."

"That when a stranger speaks to them they give a modest, audible answer, standing up, and with their faces turned towards him."

"That they observe a sober and becoming behaviour when going to, coming from, and in religious meetings."

"That their whole conduct and conversation be dutiful to their matters, and kind and affectionate to their school-fellows, and that in all cases they observe the command of Christ, All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them."

"That in the evening they collect themselves and take their seats in the dining room, and after answering to their names when called over, and attending to such parts of the holy scriptures and other religious books, which may be read to them, they retire to their bed chambers, and undress with as much stillness as possible, folding up their clothes neatly, and putting them in their proper places; and they are tenderly advised to close, as well as to begin the day, with the remembrance of their gracious Creator, whose ,ercoes are over all his works."

The instructions to school mistresses; being similar to those for school masters; and the general rules being nearly the same for girls, I omit copying them.

I cannot better conclude this subject than in the words of my learned, much respected and honoured friend Dr. Price. "Seminaries of learning are the springs of society, which, as they flow foul or pure, diffuse through successive generations depravity and misery, or on the contrary, virtue and happiness. On the bent given to our minds as they open and expand, depends their subsequent fate; and on the general management of education depend the honour and dignity of our species."

ENGLISH PRISONS and HOSPITALS.

THE TOWER.

Tower.

THE Tower is the only prison in England for state delinquents of rank. There has been no prisoner since Mr. Laurens went out, December 31st, 1781.

Here, in 1787, I saw a great quantity of junk or old cordage, and having again found the prisoners in the bridewells in and about London without employment, I cannot avoid repeating my former remark: "If the great quantities of old cables and ropes piled up at the Tower were delivered out to the several keepers of bridewells in and about London to be wrought for use, and prompt payment made for the work, this would prevent the excuses of keepers for not employing their prisoners."

NEWGATE.

Newgate.

No alteration.* In three or four rooms there were near one hundred and fifty women crowded together, many young creatures with the old and hardened, some of whom had been confined upwards of two years: on the men's side likewise there were many boys of twelve or fourteen years of age; some almost naked. In the men's infirmary, there were only seven iron bedsteads; and at my last visit, there being twenty sick, some of them, naked and with sores, in a miserable condition, lay on the floor with only a rug. There were four sick in the infirmary for women, which is only fifteen feet and a half by twelve, has but one window, and no bedsteads; sewers offensive: prison not white-washed.

* It may be proper to inform those readers who are not acquainted with my former publications, that when I say, no alteration, I speak with reference to the situation which such prison was in when I last visited it; the particulars of which may be found in my former editions of The State of the Prisons &c.

At my last visit I went over the wards of the criminals with Mr. Curtis the new Sheriff, from whose activity and zeal I would hope something may be done for the naked objects left by the late sheriffs. - The allowance of bread should be weighed in gross, and delivered to the prisoners every day.* Unless the debtors be removed to give room for the separation of the other prisoners, and a reform be made in the prisons, an audacious spirit of profaneness and wickedness will continue to prevail in the lower class of the people in London.

* In all prisons where great numbers are served with bread, if it may not be expected that every single loaf should be weighed, yet they might be weighed by tens or twenties. To every ward here, and at both the Compters, there is an orderly prisoner called a wardsman, who should wash, sweep and keep his ward fresh and clean, and who had for many years a double allowance of bread, till a late sheriff, Sir Robert Taylor, took it off. I wish this small encouragement to cleanliness had been continued.

† In my former work I have given an abstract of Sir Stephen Theodore Janssen's table of convicts &c. But, as in the riots in 1780, all the records of the Old Bailey were burnt, that table, as being the only remaining memorial, is now become so valuable, that I have thought proper to annex it entire at the end of the book. A careful perusal of it will, I doubt not, suggest many useful remarks; particularly, if the number of executions in former years be compared with the constantly increasing number of the present time, it may, more than any thing else, excite a conviction of the necessity of no longer delaying the erection of penitentiary houses in order to avoid the charges of inhumanity and impolicy, in hurrying out of the world so many young creatures, who might have been reclaimed and restored to society by a proper course of discipline.

I have also given a table of all the executions for London and Middlesex during the twelve subsequent years, and at the end of this book shall continue it to December 1788. These tables together with Janssen's will give the total number of executions for forty years past.

Here are several improvements. Four fire-places are added: plenty of water by two pipes, one on each main. Prison clean and quiet. The Lord Mayor sends three chaldrons of coals, and the Sheriffs two as usual. Keeper now has no licence. In the large work-room I always found either chair-makers, basket-makers, or coopers at work. It would be more convenient if the court were paved with flat stones, and the waste water conducted through the offensive vault. On conversing with the keeper, who is secretary to Mr. Akerman, he observed to me, "now prisoners keep taps."

1787, Nov. 6. Debtors 24.

POULTRY COMPTER.

[Poultry Compter.]

Clean, and white-washed in 1787. Some casements are wanted: in the prince's ward there are none. Criminals of both sexes are together in one small day-room. Visitors, by the false lenity of the Sheriffs, are admitted from morning to night; and persons are always ready at the gate to serve the prisoners with beer.* Allowance, to felons 1½d.in bread (weight in 1787, 17oz.) to debtors a penny loaf (weight in 1788, 11oz.) These have from the sheriffs meat and coals, weekly. Surgeon now Mr. Jones. Keeper's salary £150 in lieu of the tap.

WOOD-STREET COMPTER.

[Wood-Street Compter.]

No alteration. This ruinous prison not white-washed. Prisoners here are not restrained

in the purchase of liquors. Mr. Sheriff Bloxam has lately released sixteen debtors with money given by the public. There were no sick prisoners in either of the Compters.† Allowance to felons 1½d.in bread, weight in 1788, 1lb. Keeper's salary £225 in lieu of the tap. - A new compter is now building.

1787, March 19, Debtors 51. Felons &c. 32.

* One advantage that was expected from the abolition of the tap in gaols, was preventing the comrades of criminals from associating with them, which gave an opportunity of plotting further mischief, and tended to suppress impeachments, through the false hopes with which their companions encouraged them before their trials; but, by the unrestrained visits of their friends, and the permission of beer, wine &c. to be brought to them from certain public houses, this intended advantage is in a great measure frustrated.

† The prisons of late years are visited by the sheriffs, and they are much more healthy places of abode than they were formerly. The debtors, by the liberal contribution of the sheriffs and others, live in the compters better than many industrious tradesmen; but there is little attention to the separation of prisoners, or their morals.

Sect. VIII. LONDON. 127

BRIDEWELL.

[Bridewell.]

No alteration but the ventilator taken down. Each sex has a work-room and a night-room. They lie in boxes, with a little straw, on the floors. The prison not being strong the men were in irons. Some were picking oakum, and others were making ropes, which is a new and proper employment. Mr. Hardwick, a hemp-dresser, has their labour, and a salary of twenty guineas a year. - Allowance a penny loaf each, and four days in the week ten ounces of beef without bone &c. The allowance, for persons constantly employed, is not too much; but would it not be better if they had less meat, and more bread? The prison wants white-washing, and the men's night-room more light and air. At my first visit two were in the infirmary; at my last, only one.

1787, Nov. 6, Men 26. Women 25.

NEW PRISON CLERKENWELL.

No alteration but the keeper's house improved by the late tap-house being laid to it: still however he has no view of the courts, nor of any person coming into the prison. - The prison-rooms clean; the wardsman having, very properly, a double allowance of bread. No sick ward for women: no bedding. The bath never used: no water in that pump for two years. Chapel badly contrived: not white-washed. Men and women separated; but all sorts of prisoners associate together, playing at cards &c. - Allowance one pound of bread a day. Keeper's stated salary £50; but if his perquisites and fees do not amount to £150 more, the magistrates are to make up the deficiency. Prisoners are detained for their fees, and some pawn their scanty clothing to obtain a discharge. - Mrs. Wildman continues her late husband's weekly benefaction to this prison, and the bridewell.

CLERKENWELL BRIDEWELL.

[Clerkenwell Bridewell.]

No alteration. The prison quite clean: the rooms washed every day. The prisoners on both sides miserable objects; very dirty; some almost naked: all without employment: no sort of bedding allowed by the county:* several women in the sick ward. - Allowance, one pound of bread a day; and to the fines an additional pennyworth of bread and a pennyworth of cheese. Keeper's salary £50, to be made up £300 by perquisites and fees as at the new prison.†

The foundation is laid for a new house of correction, in a much better situation. When the prisoners are removed, the adjoining prison may be greatly improved, for the proper separation of prisoners, an infirmary, chapel &c.

St. CATHARINE'S GAOL.

[St. Catharine's.]

1787, April 4, It was let for a warehouse.

THE SAVOY.

[Savoy.]

A great part of this prison having been burnt last February, the prisoners at night are now crowded into two rooms. The prison very dirty: not white-washed these two years. Some of the prisoners almost naked; without shirts, shoes or stockings. Several prisoners died last spring, and probably many more will die the spring ensuing, if greater attention be not paid to them. Here were six of the guards in a close offensive room (the black hole) in which they are confined on bread and water twenty-four or forty-eight hours, for drunkenness, neglect of duty &c.

1788, Sept. 13, Deserters 45.

* I am sorry to observe that very little attention it still paid in our prisons to the article of bedding, so essential to the health and comfort of prisoners.

† If magistrates think that £300 is a proper salary for their keeper, would it not be more generous to allow it, than to oblige many half-naked, and almost starved objects, to part with their scanty clothing, or continue in confinement?

Sect. VIII. WESTMINSTER. 129

WESTMINSTER PRISON.

[Westminster Prison.]

This Prison, adjoining to the bridewell in Tothill-fields, the property of the dean and chapter, was erected in 1779 when the gate-house was taken down, and is now used in aid of the Savoy. It consists of four rooms, nineteen feet nine inches square, one of which is for the confinement of the refractory, in which there were two prisoners. The other three are lodging-rooms, very dirty, and the prisoners have neither bedding nor straw. Many were almost naked, and had no shoes, stockings or shirts. Several deserters had been confined from fifteen to seventeen months. Some were in heavy irons for attempting to break out. Many of them were sickly, and objects of compassion. Allowance, four-pence a day each, for which they are supplied with provisions. The stoppage of the two-pence of their pay, while they lie on the bare boards, is very severe.

1788, Sept. 17, Deserters 94.

TOTHILL-FIELDS BRIDEWELL.

[Tothill-Fields Bridewell.]

No alteration in this prison. The men associating together in one part, and the women in another; all without employment, except three or four debtors who were shoe-makers. At night, some men come to a room in the women's court, and some women go to a room on the men's side, which is called the chapel, from the use made of it by the late worthy keeper. Several prisoners were drinking in a room used by the turnkey for his shop. Here is also a room for the deposit of bonnets and other articles of clothing, which may be a convenient security for the keeper's fees; one woman, however, I turned out, who had remained four days after the expiration of her term, and had no share in the property contained in this room. In some county gaols the salaries to the gaolers are in lieu of all fees; whereby the hardship of forcing poor creatures to part with some of their scanty clothing, in order to purchase their discharge, is prevented. No bedding here, which is the case in all the London prisons, except that in the city called bridewell, where they have a little loose straw, and beds for the few who can pay a high price for them. Surgeon Mr. Hanbury. Salary £30. No infirmary.*

* In conversation with the keeper, he observed, that a prisoner's term of confinement ends at midnight. - It would be much better if prisoners were released after receiving their bread allowance, and not in the evening; for many, having neither money nor friends, are immediately exposed to the temptation of repeating their former crimes.

130 SOUTHWARK. Sect. VIII.

THE KING'S BENCH PRISON.

MARSHALSEA PRISON.

[Marshalsea prison.]

No alteration in this ruinous prison. The premisses belong to four landlords, and Mrs. Marson, the widow of the late deputy marshal, has them on a long lease, at £101 rent. She lets some small rooms to the prisoners at 3s. a week, and other rooms to persons who are not prisoners: here is a drunken turnkey; and spirituous liquors are sold as common as beer. Within the prison is an alehouse (or tap) where there are frequent scenes of riot and debauchery.

BOROUGH COMPTER.

[Borough Comptor.]

A new gaol on a bad plan. Stair cases narrow: passages dark and only three feet wide: the wards of the men and women debtors join, so that the prisoners associate together. The whole prison very dirty; not white-washed since occupied at Michaelmas 1787. Sewers not offensive, the tide ebbing and flowing through them. Garnish (2s. 10d.) not abolished. Allowance, a penny loaf a day (weight in 1788, 10½oz.) Eleanor Gwinn's charity, of sixty-five loaves every eight weeks, continued regularly. Keeper, a sheriff's officer for Surrey: no salary. - A new table of fees hung on the gate; but as it seemed to be written by the keeper, and was not signed by any magistrate, I do not copy it.

1787, April 2, 6 Debtors.

1788, Aug. 28, 11 Court of Conscience Debtors.

The two other prisons in Southwark belong to the county of Surrey.

* One morning, on mentioning to the marshal's substitute that several prisoners were drinking, he replied, "The chief vice among prisoners is drunkenness; and that brings them here; and while they can drink and riot in prison they disregard the confinement."

† One of the common-side debtors was act old man, whole original debt was £10: 4: O to a cow-keeper at Marybone, who has regularly paid him the allowance of 2s. 4d. a week ever since January 1784.

Sect. VIII. LONDON. 131

I shall now give a brief Account of the HOSPITALS for the SICK in this great Metropolis, with such Remarks as suggested themselves to me in a late visit to them.

The London Hospital in Whitechapel Road.

[London Hospital.]

This spacious building is for the reception and relief of sick and wounded seamen &c. It consists of eighteen wards; but now seven only are occupied; some having been shut up two or three years. The wards in general are twenty feet wide, and twelve high, and each contains about eighteen beds, which have no testers. Over the doors were square apertures. The passages, which are eight feet wide, are dark. There are no cisterns for water: the vaults are often offensive. In this, and our other hospitals, medical and chirurgical patients are together. Here the middle floor is occupied by the women, and the lower and upper floors by the men. Would it not be better if the men were on one side of the house, and the women on the other? I could wish that there were two wards appropriated to Jew patients, as they must almost starve, on their scanty allowance of bread and beer, with only two-pence halfpenny a day. Perhaps a proper attention to them might be repaid by subscriptions from the opulent of their own profession. In a dirty room in the cellar there is a cold and a hot bath, which seem to be seldom used. - The wards were not dirty, but the house has not been white-washed for some years; nor has it, within or without the appearance of neatness. Patients are generously admitted without any fee or reward to nurses &c. nor is any security required for the expense of burial or removal; but for parish poor and soldiers, four-pence per day must be paid for their subsistence. - All accidents, whether recommended or not, are received at any hour of the day or night. - Here is a large chapel, in which divine service is performed twice every Sunday; and prayers are read three days in the week.

The patients' diet I disapprove of; as, their common diet is 8oz. of meat every day for dinner; and for supper, broth six days in the week. No vegetables, and only 12oz. of bread a day. - The middle diet is 4oz. of meat every day for dinner; and for supper, a pint of broth or panado. No vegetables, and only 8oz. of bread. The breakfast for every day, of those patients that are on common diet, is one pint of milk pottage or water-gruel. Those on the middle diet, one pint of panado pr water-gruel. The drink of the former is three pints of beer in summer and one quart in winter. Of the latter one pint of-beer every day.

Sept. 15th, 1788, Patients 120.

By a letter lately received, I am informed that the committee are exerting themselves, and making several improvements in this hospital.

132 LONDON. Sect. VIII.

St. Bartholomew's Hospital Smithfield.

[St. Bartholomew's Hospital.]

The wards of this hospital, which are three sides of a spacious quadrangle, are on the ground floor and three stories above. The wards, being double, have not the advantage of opposite windows; but they were clean and not offensive, except the men's four foul wards, which are on the uppermost story, and had not one window open. The two foul wards for women were clean and fresh. The wards are lofty, twenty-two feet wide, and in each were about fifteen beds. The bedsteads are wood, and their testers, though lofty, are a harbour for dust and lumber. The beds were not crowded, and the wards were quiet. The staircases are wide; the landing places spacious; and the windows were open. - The diet of the patients is nearly the same as in the London hospital, except on Thursdays, when instead of 8oz. of meat they have 4 oz. of cheese and 2 oz. of butter; and every day a pint of milk pottage, but on Thursday a pint and a half; and every day three pints of beer. The allowance of bread is too small. - Here is a large cold bath, and a room adjoining for a warm bath. To each ward there is a sister and a nurse; the former has a room adjoining, but no window into her ward. Fees are taken for the admission of patients: for clean patients 2s. viz. 1s. for the sister, 6d. to the nurse, 6d. to the beadle; for foul patients £1: 5: 8, viz. 5s. for flannels, 18s. 8d.for two months subsistence at 4d. per day: 2s. ward dues. - Every patient must deposit 17s. 6d.for a burial fee, or a house-keeper give security; except in case of sudden accidents. Sept. 19th, 1788, Patients 428.*

* Adjoining to Bartholomew's Hospital is Christ's Hospital, which being the greatest charitable institution in this kingdom for the education of children, I shall give a short account of it. Here are now only boys, the girls being removed to Hertford. Near a thousand children enjoy the benefit of this noble institution.

In October 1788, there were in the Mathematical School - 44

Grammar School - 49

Under Grammar School - 148

Writing School - 207

Reading School - 96

At Hertford, Boys - 353

- Girls - 53

Total 950

The mathematical, and some other school-rooms, are lofty and good; and the dining room is large, in which the children meet three times a day. The beds are improperly close to the wall, and have wooden testers. The boys lie two in a bed, and the beds have clean linen once a month. The kitchen has a cupola, and is the freshest and best kitchen for an hospital I have ever seen. The staircases, school-rooms and dormitories should be lime-whited every year: great attention is paid to the cleanliness of the boys: they are washed morning and evening, and have clean linen twice a week.

No children are admitted under the age of seven. The girls are discharged at fourteen, and the boys at fifteen, except the mathematical boys and those intended for the university.

The boys have coats once a year: breeches twice; shoes and stockings every quarter: caps and girdles yearly; and bands four times a year.

Sect. VIII. LONDON. 133

The Middlesex Hospital in Marybone.

[Middlesex Hospital.]

This hospital, built in 1755, and supported by voluntary contribution, consists of sixteen wards, of which only four are occupied, the funds being very low. The rooms are close and dirty, except one called the founder's. The bedsteads and wooden testers are old: the house wants white-washing, and the whole has an air of poverty: yet an order is hung up, that no servant shall take any fee, gratuity or reward. - In the printed laws, and orders I am sorry to find the following one. "That all drugs, medicines, materials and necessaries be bought from persons, who will furnish them at the cheapest rate, and that the preference be given to tradesmen who are subscribers."

Sept. 16th, 1788, Patients 70.

At every meal, the master who presides having struck three times with a hammer for silence, a boy in the desk, with an audible voice, asks a blessing and returns thanks.

An augmentation of one fifth has lately been made to the bread allowance. They have now daily for breakfast half a small loaf: the same quantity for dinner; and also for supper, with a small quantity of either butter or cheese. The loaves are about the size of threehalfpenny loaves, and remarkably good. They have for dinner on

Sunday, Beef boiled, with broth.

Monday, Milk pottage, with bread and butter.

Tuesday, Mutton roasted.

Wednesday, Millet, or rice milk with bread.

Thursday, Beef boiled, with broth.

Friday, Boiled mutton, with broth.

Saturday, Pease porridge, with bread and butter.

On particular days, the gift of benefactors, veal roasted, beef roasted, pork roasted, and pork boiled. Of meat, each child has about four ounces. I made a remark on the impropriety of the blue-coat school boys in Dublin being accustomed to so much animal food, without potatoes or any kind of vegetables: I must make the same here, and especially, as I am now persuaded that that school and several others copy after this excellent charity. On this subject many authors might be quoted; but I shall only mention Dr. Macbride, who, in his Experimental Essays, shews, "that a property common to all fresh vegetables, is, that when mixed with any animal substance, and placed in the proper degree of heat, they presently run into fermentation, and, in the course of that fermentation, throw off a subtile vapour, or spirit, of surprising activity, endued with a power of restoring sweetness to putrid animal fluids." And the Doctor "lays it down as a position, not easily to be controverted, that the genuine putrid scurvy has never been known to yield to any other medicines than to such as are composed of fresh vegetables; and provided they be fresh, and of such a nature as will allow them to be taken freely, it is almost no matter what they are. The acid, the sweet and the bitter, all of them cure the scurvy." - "Sir John Pringle ascribes, and with great justice, to the frequent use of fresh vegetables and sugar, which now make up so great a part of the diet of the European nations, that we at this day so seldom hear of the dreadful putrid diseases which formerly swept off such multitudes, every thirty or forty years, and generally went under the name of plagues."

Here is a clean and separate court, with wards for the sick. Only one of these was occupied, in which were five children. I was informed that only two died last year.

The charges and orders for the several officers of this hospital are published, and given to the governors: and with pleasure I confirm the remark of my worthy friend the late Dr. Fothergill, "that in this, which is one of the largest public schools for the education of children in this kingdom, and in the centre of the city of London, and where people of all ranks and orders are perpetually passing and repassing; such is the due subordination that is impressed upon them by their superiors, that one sees amongst them, while at play in the public courts of the school, much less rudeness and disorderly conduct than might have been expected even from a more confined course of education."

134 LONDON. Sect. VIII.

St. Thomas's Hospital in Southwark.

[St. Thomas's Hospital.]

Some of the wards in this hospital are only eighteen feet wide: the bedsteads are iron and very properly detached from the walls: there are no tellers, but semicircular irons for the curtains in winter. The wards were fresh and clean, except the three foul wards, in which were fifty-three men and twenty-seven women: these were very offensive and had not a window open. There were no water closets. The bread was excellent.

The Diet Table was as follows:

"FULL DIET.

Breakfast. Milk porridge four days, water gruel three days.

Dinner. Three days half a pound boiled mutton, and two days beef; the other two days 4oz. butter, or 6 oz. cheese.

Supper. Broth one pint, on meat days bread fourteen ounces; beer one quart in winter, and three pints in summer.

MIDDLE OR LOW DIET.

Breakfast. Milk porridge four days, water gruel three days.

Dinner. Six ounces of mutton or veal five days, the other two days as above, viz. cheese or butter.

Supper. Milk porridge four days, water gruel three days. Bread 12 oz. beer one quart.

MILK DIET.

Breakfast. Milk porridge four days, water gruel three days.

Dinner. One pint rice milk, or 8oz. of pudding (if possible) three days.

Supper. Milk porridge four days, water gruel three days. Drink one part milk and two water; a quart in winter, three pints in dimmer. Bread 12oz.

DRY DIET.

Breakfast. Two ounces cheese, or 2oz. butter.

Dinner. The same as the full diet, till it can be determined about pudding.

Supper. Two ounces cheese, or 2oz. butter. Five sea biscuits, or bread 14oz. - Beer one quart a day.

FEVER DIET.

Barley water, water gruel, panado, thin broth, milk porridge, rice gruel, balm or sage tea, when, ordered;"

The rules of the hospital, and the duty of the nurses and patients were hung up.

I copy a good order at this hospital.

"XII. That if any surgeon have any considerable or extraordinary operation to perform, he shall give notice of the time of his doing the same to the other surgeons, that they may be present." But I searched in vain to find (what I have often wished were a standing order in all hospitals) that no amputation should ever take place till after a consultation of three medical gentlemen, who shall be of unanimous opinion that it is absolutely necessary, and that there is no probability of effecting a cure without the use of the knife and saw.*

* In a county hospital, I have known one of the most excruciating of all chirurgical operations prevented, by the spirited exertions of the good old house apothecary: and the patient by his attention and care was cured. And even in the experience of a private country gentleman, among the surrounding poor, some instances have occurred, in which rest, regimen, and cooling physic have saved limbs, which gentlemen of the faculty were decidedly of opinion must be amputated.

Sect. VIII. LONDON. 135

[St. Thomas's Hospital.]

Every clean patient pays a fee of 3s. 6d. at admission, and a foul or venereal patient pays 10s. 6d. besides 4d. a day; and all pay the nurses for washing their linen. A surety engages to supply the patient with clean body linen every week, and pay the fees for his burial to the steward of the hospital. I am sorry to find such great quantities of beer brought from public houses into this and other hospitals. Here and at Guy's, the patients easily get out, there being no proper attention to the gates, so that the adjoining gin-shops often prevent the efficacy of medicine and diet. Sept. 17th, 1788, Patients 440.

Guy's Hospital in Southwark.

[Guy's Hospital.]

This hospital was founded and endowed at the sole expense of Thomas Guy, a private citizen of London, and erected during his life-time. The wards in this hospital are in general too low: the height of some is only nine feet and a half. In several of the old wards (each containing about thirty beds) the beds and testers are wood, and infested with bugs. In the new wards, which were clean and fresh,* are iron bedsteads and hair beds; and each patient has a box which slides under the bedstead, and makes a seat when drawn out. The window at the upper end of each of these wards opens from the cieling to the floor;† if and there are also ventilators in the cielings which communicate with the chimneys of the wards over them, and by means of the common fires draw off the foul air. The water closets in the new wards are on the best construction, and not in the least offensive; for by opening the door, water is turned into them.‡ Here is a good contrivance for easily opening the upper sashes, which in other hospitals, being lofty and heavy, are opened with difficulty. The medicines are principally prepared under the care of an ingenious gentleman, who has been furnished with a laboratory and mills, that they may be certain of having their drugs free, from adulteration. The patients box and medicine-tray, are numbered: this prevents confusion, and consequently mistakes which may be sometimes fatal, through the ignorance or carelessness of nurses. Here are excellent baths, in clean and neat rooms. The alterations in this hospital are to go on, and as it is situated in a very close part of the

* The following order is in the rules of this hospital, that "if any patient be found smoking tobacco in bed, or in the ward, they are to be discharged."

† The sashes are hung on pivots, which are on each side the window: they are in several divisions, and lap upon each other: - when they are set open to their greatest extent, they form horizontal planes, at right angles with the sash-frames, and admit air equal to the whole opening of the window, excepting the substance of the frames.

‡ The water closets are constantly supplied with fresh water, from a reservoir; they empty and fill the basin by opening the door. They are so simply constructed that they require little attention, and are not liable to be easily put out of repair. They are free from ill scents. The basin is of earthen or queen's ware, glazed; and it is always charged with water, being supplied afresh every time the patient leaves the closet. The door acts on the cistern by a common lever, and the same operation discharges all that is left in the basin.

town, and surrounded with buildings, they are highly commendable, that the patients may enjoy the advantage of a free circulation of air. Each ward is to be taken in rotation; it being the desire of the governors, and that of the present, attentive treasurer, to carry the improvements, for the benefit of the patients to the greatest extent. The architect is the ingenious Mr. William Blackburn. - To the former gentlemen I must mention, that I saw a woman bring her child, and with tears leave the fee of 2s. 9d. for the nurse, and 6d. for the steward. - The foul patients pay 7s. Every patient on admission must lay down 20s. or find security for their burial. Sept. 17th, 1788, Patients 304.

The Westminster Hospital in James's-street.

[Westminster Hospital.]

This was the first of its kind in this kingdom. It was instituted 1719, For the Relief of the Sick and Needy from all Parts; with an establishment for incurables, begun 1734, supported by voluntary contributions. The wards of this old hospital are in general only seventeen feet wide: the beds parallel and close to the walls, with wooden testers: the floors were sanded; and the walls dirty. Most of the upper sashes were not moveable. A sum is paid every year for the destruction of bugs. Bread allowance to the patients is too small. A diet-table is published, and an annual account, but no book of the rules and orders. Here are no ward-fees taken, nor security for burial. Sept. 24th, 1788, Patients 71, and 14 Incurables.

St. George's Hospital for Sick and Lame at Hyde-Park-Corner.

[St. George's Hospital.]

This is in a good situation. Here are three large, and three small wards for men; and the same number for women: the lower wards are for accidents. The wards are twenty-two feet and a half wide, and only ten and a half high: they are too close, especially the men's, which were very offensive, all the windows being shut. The windows are small, and too distant from the cieling: the bedsteads are old, have testers, and the beds stand close to the wall:* the floors were sanded; and the walls wanted white-washing. The kitchen and offices are under ground, and were neither neat nor clean. A good cold bath, but not used. A good garden. The staircases here, and in almost all our hospitals, are of wood: the stone staircases in the hospitals abroad are more proper.

* I am fully persuaded that very much depends on the patients lying on fresh and clean beds. In many hospitals the beds are old, and crowded against the walls, so that there is no circulation of air round them; and, by a succession of patients with various disorders, must be very offensive. If the annual sum paid in several hospitals for the destruction of bugs, were expended in airing, beating, and brushing the beds, the end, perhaps, would be much better answered. For in the country where the air is fresh, and freely admitted into lodging-rooms, there are few or no bugs. In the hospitals in Sweden I observed a very good mode of sweetening the beds: on every fine day a certain number were brought into the open air, and beaten and brushed on a deal machine made for that purpose. I could wish that such a practice were adopted in our hospitals, and that the rest of the bedding were more frequently washed and aired.

[St. George's Hospital.]

There are no rules or orders published; but only an annual account, with the names of the governors &c. on one sheet of paper. In several wards this order is painted on a board.

"At a General Court, Jan. 11th, 1783, ordered, That no person whatsoever belonging to this house presume, upon pain of expulsion, to take of any, either in or out-patient a fee, reward or gratification of any kind, directly or indirectly, for any service received in this house; and this not only while they are under the care of this house, but also after they shall be discharged."

Sept. 22d, 1788, Patients 150.

The British Lying-in Hospital, in Brownlow-street, for the Reception of Married Women.

[British Lying-in Hospital.]

Here are six wards, and in each six beds. The wards were clean and quiet: provision good: kitchen and pantry clean. This is a good institution, and proper attention is paid to the patients; who continue here three weeks after they are delivered. The house is old, and wants white-washing, and the cielings are too low. Here female pupils are instructed in the art of midwifery, and after residing four or six months, receive certificates of their ability to practise. Women are admitted here in the most generous manner, for no fee or gratification of any kind is allowed to the nurses or servants.

The laws, orders and regulations of this hospital are published, and they are full and explicit. I was glad to find the following one, viz. "The ladies, governors and subscribers to this charity, may at any time visit the lying-in wards; and such their visitation will be esteemed as a favour done to the charity."

Women delivered and discharged from Dec. 31st, 1786, to Dec. 31st, 1787, 550. Died 7. - Total 557.

The City of London Lying-in Hospital in the City Road, for Married Women.

[London Lying-in Hospital.]

Here are eight wards, seventeen feet wide, which open into passages six feet wide; six only are occupied, each containing eight beds. The wards and beds were clean, and over the door of each ward was a circular aperture of about a foot diameter. Here there is a chapel. The house wants white-washing. - The women continue three weeks after delivery, and in particular cases longer; if they choose it, their children are baptized in the house. The annual account is published; and in the hall, lists of the donors' names are painted on boards; also the hospital list of women and children, which commenced in 1771, when there were 489 Women delivered; 4 had twins. Total born 493, viz. Males 230, Females 263.

The numbers in 1779 were 545 - 6 - 551 - 281, - 270.

Opposite the door is this order; that no person be allowed to go up into the wards to visit the patients, but between the hours of three and five in the afternoon.

I could wish that there were a standing order in this, and all hospitals, that no governors or governesses of hospitals should have any concern, directly or indirectly, in serving the hospitals to which they belong with provisions &c.

The Lock Hospital near Hyde-Park-Corner, for the Relief of Venereal Patients only.*

[Lock Hospital.]

Here are three wards for men and three for women. The beds have canvass testers. The wards want white-washing. The chapel is spacious: the patients during divine service are in two upper rooms, concealed from the audience by blinds. There is a good bathing room, and a garden. Visiters to the patients are admitted on Mondays, from two o'clock till four. The abstract of the rules and orders is published. The admission and dismission of the patients are without a fee or gratuity to any of the servants, and no security at admission is required for their burial.

Sept. 22d, 1788, Men 36. Women 28.

* A prejudice prevailing in the minds of many people against such hospitals will, I hope, be my excuse for copying the Introduction to the Abstract of the Rules and Orders.

"The disease which intitles the objects of this hospital to relief, is in itself extremely loathsome, and direful in its effects; and the unhappy sufferers, if poverty be their companion, are doubtless involved in the most deplorable wretchedness.

Many a worthy woman has here to lament the diabolical profligacy of an abandoned husband. - Many a poor and helpless infant to deplore its being the offspring of a distempered parent. - Many a young creature of tender years, yea, even in infancy itself, has to bewail the inhuman violence of a diseased, filthy, and loathsome ravisher. - Others who have been led away by the arts and wiles of seducers, by promises made only to be broken, and fair words meant only to deceive. - And lastly, many who have inadvertently fought their own ruin, have also been cured in this hospital; such, many such, but for this house, had rotted and perished miserably. Some of these, whose lives have happily been preserved, have kissed the rod of affliction; by the blessing of God have turned from their iniquity, and been happily restored to their family, their country and themselves.

Therefore their having brought on themselves the disease by their own sin and folly is no reason why they should be left to perish. A life lost to the public, from whatever cause, is still a loss. - If we speak of the matter in a christian view, how dare any, who profess to know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, make this an objection? Suppose the Redeemer had urged such a plea against becoming poor for our sakes; suppose he had said of us, - "Leave those sinners to the consequences of their sin and folly - they are miserable, guilty, lost and undone, but it was their own fault - let them perish eternally - let the law take its vengeance on them - I'll not become poor for their sakes, to save them from its curse, for they do not deserve that I should," - had this been the language of our Lord, where had we now been? - We should not now be partaking of his mercies, but feeling his righteous vengeance - not invited to an opportunity of shewing pity and compassion to others, but ourselves in torment, crying in vain for a drop of water to cool our tongues.

And though this charity gives encouragement to repentance, by giving the most profligate, one fair opportunity to reflect, and amend their lives, yet it destroys all incitement to presumption, by affording no repetition of its countenance and favour, to the hardened and impenitent. - For it is a fixed, determinate, fundamental rule of the charity, that no person whatsoever, if once discharged, is ever to be admitted a second time. -

Bethlem Hospital in Moorfields,

For the Cure of Lunatics, and the Reception of Incurables.

[Bethlem Hospital.]

The committee room and apartments for the stewards &c. are in the centre; and in long galleries and wings on each side, are the rooms for the patients. The size of these rooms is twelve feet by eight feet ten inches, and twelve feet ten inches high: the rooms in the wings and at the top of the house are less: the galleries are sixteen feet wide. On the four floors there are about two hundred and seventy rooms: these were quite clean and not offensive, though the house is old and wants white-washing. The galleries have, very properly, rooms only on one side. The patients communicate with one another from the top to the bottom of the house, so that there is no separation of the calm and quiet from the noisy and turbulent, except those who are chained in their cells. To each side of the house there is only one vault: very offensive. There are no cisterns at the top of the house, nor water in the upper floor.

There are sitting rooms with fire-places properly guarded with iron - a cold bath and airing grounds for each sex - no chapel - Bread allowance to patients, 1lb. a day (8oz. at dinner, and the same at supper). Their bread, butter, cheese and beer were very good. Two house-keepers, "when a patient is to be admitted, enter into a bond of £100 to pay for bedding and clothes, during the patient's continuance in the hospital, and to take him or her away when discharged by the committee, and to pay the charge of burial, if the patient die in the hospital." When a patient is dismissed as incurable, his name is entered, that when there is a vacancy among the incurables (the number of whom is sixty men and fifty women) he may be admitted, paying only half a crown a week. - Visiters are admitted by a governor's ticket, only on Mondays and Wednesdays, between the hours of ten and twelve.

St. Luke's Hospital for Lunatics in Old-street Road.

[St. Luke's Hospital.]

This spacious building was first occupied on new year's day 1786; the former in Moorfields being old and inconvenient. Here are on each of the three floors, three long galleries and wings, with opposite cells for the patients; and in the centre are apartments for officers &c. On one side of these apartments are the men, on the other the women. In each gallery there are thirty-two cells which are arched, boarded and wainscoted

And all the patients, have a paper of rules and directions delivered to them at their admission, at the bottom of which stand these words. -

N.B. "Having been once cured or discharged for any other cause out of this hospital, you never can be admitted again."

Therefore the language of this institution is, like that of our blessed Lord - "Go and sin no more," and like him it adds, "lest a worse thing happen unto thee."

140 London. Sect. VIII.

[St. Luke's Hospital.]

(ten feet four inches by eight, and thirteen feet three inches high) and each cell has a window outward, and a large aperture over the door, with inside wire lattice to the iron bars, to prevent accidents, and (very properly) no shutters. The cells were very clean and not offensive. The boxes on which the beds or straw lie are on a declivity, and have false bottoms. The cells open into galleries fifteen feet wide; and in each gallery was a vault, which was not offensive. There are many cisterns on the top of the house, which are filled by four machines or forcing pumps, to supply the galleries with water. These machines cost £200. Here are large airing grounds for men and women: there is also a new, but very inconvenient bath.

Every patient is admitted till cured, or for one year, and must bring a security from two householders of £100, to take him out at the end of that term. If within the year he be dismissed as cured, and relapses within two months, he may be readmitted on the former petition. At the end of the year the patients who are not cured, are put on the list of incurables. Here are forty incurables, who are called boarders, for each of whom their friends pay five shillings a week.

Here are very properly two sitting rooms in each gallery, one for the quiet, the other for the turbulent; but I could wish that the noisy and turbulent were in a separate part of the house, by day and by night. I have mentioned the propriety of hair beds for the sick, and in such houses as this they are peculiarly necessary, because water runs through them.

Several women were calm and quiet, and at needle-work with the matron. A chapel would be proper here for the advantage of recovering patients, as I have seen in such houses abroad.

Though this noble hospital was neat and clean, yet I greatly prefer one at Constantinople, which is described in this volume, and the Dol-huis at Amsterdam, which is particularly mentioned in my former publications.

Sept. 25, 1788, Men 54. Women 108.

[Remarks.]

I shall beg leave to subjoin a few general observations concerning defects in the London hospitals, premising, that I fear the public attention to them is much relaxed of late years, in consequence of the newer establishments of dispensaries, which have multiplied so as to injure the funds of the older institutions.

The securities and fees required at admission into many of the hospitals bear hard upon the poor, and absolutely exclude many of those who have the greatest occasion for charitable relief. The nurses' fees in particular open a door to many impositions.

The visits of Governors are too often only a matter of form, the visiter hurrying out of an offensive room, and readily acquiescing in the reports of nurses &c. Hence I apprehend, many instances of neglect in surgeons and their dressers, as well as other officers, go unnoticed.

I have never found any clergyman administering consolation and admonition to the sick; and prayers are usually attended by very few.

Sect. VIII. LONDON. 141

[Remarks.]

White-washing the wards is seldom or never practised; and injurious prejudices against washing floors, and admitting fresh air, are suffered to operate.

Bathing, either hot or cold, is scarcely ever used; I suppose, because it would give trouble to the attendants.

There are no convalescent wards or sitting rooms, so that patients are often turned out very unfit for work, or the common mode of living.

The admission of great quantities of beer for the patients from ale-houses, by alledged, or pretended orders from the faculty, is a great and growing evil. Every article of diet should be provided by the hospital, and no other, on any account, be admitted.

It is a pity that for want of attention to these circumstances, such noble institutions should be rendered of much less public utility, than was intended by their generous founders and supporters.

I gave in my last Publication some hints on the Construction and Regulation of Hospitals, most of which were collected from the observations I had made abroad: I shall now take the liberty of repeating them, with a few additional observations.

The situation of an Infirmary or Hospital should be on elevated ground, near a stream of water, and out of a town. - The wards, if only one for each sex, to be from twenty-five to thirty feet high, arched, and without apartments over them; otherwise, the building to consist of only two stories beside the cellars, and the area extended as far as necessary upon this plan, that the inconvenience of higher rooms may be avoided. The first floor raised four or five steps from the ground, and the ascent made easy to the entrance. The wards fifteen feet high to the cielings, and distinct ones for medical and chirurgical patients. Two doors to each ward, one of them iron latticed, or canvass. Staircase of stone, spacious, convenient and easy, as in Italy, Marseilles, Malta &c. No room to contain more than eight beds. The windows lofty and opposite, or large circular apertures (as at Leeds infirmary) opening into passages not less than six feet wide: hasps and staples to the upper sashes to prevent their being shut at improper times: one of the windows should open from the cieling to the floor, either as folding doors, or like those at Guy's hospital: a stone gallery for more readily opening and shutting the windows, as in the Italian hospitals. The cielings lathed and plastered, and proper apertures in them. The fire-places in the middle of the longer side of the wards: the beds in spacious recesses, as at Toledo and Burgos; or to each bed a with curtains as at Genoa, Savona &e. The bedsteads iron, painted, and with a screw, that the backs may be easily raised or lowered; the beds on varnished boards or laths, with hair mattresses. In each ward a cistern, basin and towel for the patients. Vaults on the outside of the wards, and water closets, as at Guy's hospital: for every improvement that may render such places less offensive, should be carefully adopted in all houses containing a number of inhabitants. Airy rooms and refectories for convalescent patients; one spare and unfurnished

[Remarks.]

ward; each ward to be taken in succession, and called the spare ward. The kitchen, wash-house, brew-house and bake-house, out of the house: but if the kitchen be in the house, it should be lofty, as in Christ's hospital (not under ground) and the entrance through the servants' hall. A convenient bath, with an easy descent into it. A piazza and spacious walk to induce patients to take the air and exercise. The wards washed once a week - scraped and lime-whited at least once a year. (The machines at Northwich for supplying the salt mines with fresh air, being on a simple construction, would be of admirable use in hospitals, especially if situated in close and confined places.) The patients washed at their admission in the cold or warm bath, and to conform strictly to the rules of nicety and cleanliness.

It may be proper to suggest, that many of these ideas may be adopted with equal propriety in the construction and regulation of poor houses.

COUNTY GAOL at HERTFORD.

[Hertford County Gaol.]

The windows are neither sufficiently large nor lofty, and the felons' day-rooms are too small: not white-washed. On their side garnish is abolished; but the debtors have the assurance to write it up, and no restraint of liquors is fixed by the magistrates. Some years ago, complaint being made to Judge Forster that the two shillings and sixpence a week was not paid to the assize convicts, he reprimanded the under sheriff; since which it has been regularly paid, and charged in his bill of cravings. No bath, though the surgeon observed the propriety of it in gaol-fevers.* Gaoler's salary now £180. No licence.

* I hope I shall be excused repeating what I formerly mentioned; that in the interval of two of my visits to the old gaol, the gaol-fever prevailed, and carried off seven or eight prisoners, and two turnkeys; that I was then well-informed, that a prisoner brought out as dead, from one of the dungeons, on being under the pump, shewed signs of life, and soon after recovered. Since this, I have known other instances of the same kind.

COUNTY GAOL at CHELMSFORD.

[Chelmsford County Gaol.]

The debtors' court and apartments are convenient and spacious. They have very properly a large day-room and work-room. Though the greatest number were in the former, yet in the latter some weavers and shoe-makers were at work. The felons' court is also spacious, and paved with flat stones; and I hope will never be spoiled with cells or any other buildings. In a narrow court on the women's side, there are eight new cells. The women are in the infirmary, which has never been furnished with beds &c. for the sick. The roof of this prison is now covered with copper, it having been laid too flat, which is the fault of almost all the new prisons. Allowance 1½lb. of bread, and a quart of small beer, for which the county pays the keeper 3d. a day. Transports have the 1s. 6d. a week. The table of fees, the clauses against spirituous liquors, and the act for preserving the health of prisoners hung up. The gaol has been white-washed and is clean. No bath. Acquitted prisoners are kept in irons till the judge leaves the town, unless the fees to the clerk of the crown be paid. Forty convicts here (some of whom had been under sentence of transportation three or four years) regularly receive the king's allowance of 2s. 6d. a week. In many other gaols the convicts have only the county allowance; and several gaolers have observed, that when released after long confinement, they seldom live above a year or two. Here is a better contrivance for the execution of criminals than that at Newgate. The hooks and eyes being fixed in the wall, the scaffolding is easily placed; and, by a simple contrivance, the platform falls back, and the criminals are left hanging. I have now no complaint of the neglect of the chaplain's duty; but I could wish that here, and in all county gaols, those gentlemen would note down every time of their attendance in a book kept for the purpose, for the inspection of the magistrates; as is done in some hospitals. - Gaoler's salary £280 in lieu of the tap.

All the men lay in one ward: the sick complained to me that they were disturbed and deprived of sleep by the noise of the others. At the same time I found that one of the two sick rooms, for the sake of a small emolument, was filled with the arms of the militia. Keeper's salary £30.

Court not paved. Allowance for straw only £2 a year. Prison not clean: has been white-washed but once. Employment, spinning jersey; but, the county having all the profit, little work is done. In the State of the Prisons, I mentioned the propriety of a latticed partition (or pound) before the keeper's door; and now there is one (five feet by four and a half) but it was not made till the keeper and his family had been cruelly used by several of the prisoners, who rushed out at the time of locking up.

Here are many good alterations. The Debtors' is new and separate; and the gaoler's house is now between that and the felons' prison. The rooms that were lately the debtors' on the first floor, and also their court, are now occupied by the felons; yet they are still crowded and have too little air. The infirmary, which consists of two close rooms, is in one of the courts. No bath. Two years ago, about twenty died of the gaol-fever. The thick wooden bars in the windows of the wards greatly obstruct the air and light. Divine service is still performed on the staircase. Several windows both of the debtors and felons are towards the street, which occasion many inconveniences to the neighbourhood. Here are no rules respecting the quantity of liquors which may be admitted for the debtors: indeed rules would be almost useless where the windows are so situated. Debtors and felons have the county allowance of bread and beer, and the assize convicts have also the half crown a week. Some of the prisoners expressed their desire of having their bread allowance increased, though they were to have less beer.

The Gaol was clean. I observed that the irons on the felons were very light, which induces them to use exercise; and I am persuaded that a good gaoler can more easily manage his prisoners by humane attention than by severity and heavy irons. Gaoler's salary £300 in lieu of the tap.

Here was a prisoner under sentence of death in one of the dungeons. The gaoler agreed with me in opinion, that execution should not be deferred longer than ten days after the sentence.

Each room has two doors (one iron grated) an iron bedstead, straw mattress and bolster, two blankets and a quilt. The staircases are stone with iron rails, and all the windows close glazed, not made to open. There are two infirmaries on each floor, the only rooms which have chimneys. The chapel is in the centre, and has thirty-two pews, each three feet by two feet two inches: the sides so lofty that the prisoners cannot see one another, though they are all in the view of the chaplain. The keeper's house is detached, and has only one closet window towards the prison. Allowance two pounds of bread a day. No employment. There are many good rules in the keeper's book, which I hope will be printed and hung up. Keeper's salary £50, and half a guinea a week to the turnkey. No fees. Surgeon's salary £15.

* On conversing with the surgeon on the health of those prisoners who have no fermented liquors, he said, "I have never seen any prisoners intoxicated since I have attended the new gaol; but I have seen the former gaoler, who had the tap, and eight or nine debtors drunk in the kitchen." The gaoler told me, that he had a debtor who was so addicted to the use of spirits, that he thought he should die if they were refused him; but after his discharge, he had several times called to acknowledge the benefit he had received from entirely breaking him of that habit. The gaoler also asserted, that the felons after a few weeks were evidently improved in health by their restriction from all spirituous and fermented liquors, and remained in prison perfectly well.

Some of the common side debtors' rooms look into the felons' court. One cannot but lament that so opulent a county should have such a close and ill constructed gaol.

This reminds me of what I once heard a keeper say, "I endeavour to plague and teaze my prisoners by making them saw wood with a blunt saw." The prison not white-washed. No straw or blankets allowed by the county. Keeper, a sheriffs officer, has one woman debtor in confinement.

KINGSTON upon Thames. The prison very dirty: not white-washed. Fowls in the courts. No employment, but an order similar to that at the bridewell in St. George's Fields, for those prisoners that are committed to hard labour. Allowance, a three halfpenny loaf a day to each prisoner (weight 14oz.). Though there were only twenty-four prisoners, yet the baker assured me he had delivered thirty-three loaves that day, and on every day in the preceding week. - Some of the prisoners had bedding or straw: several of them paid 9d. others 1s. for the straw on which they

* Fifty of the felons in 1787 were convicts for transportation, sentenced in 1783 and the following years. These poor wretches lay almost perishing in the gaol, and had only the allowance of a day in bread, and the precarious charity of a little meat, broth &c. collected from the neighbours who knew their distress. Many had worn out their shoes, stockings and shirts, and had hardly clothes to cover them; and by being forced to live in idleness, and associating together, were driven to acts of desperation. Such dreadful nurseries have been a principal cause of the increased number of crimes, and the shocking destruction of our fellow creatures. I am persuaded this would have been in a great measure prevented, if penitentiary houses had been both on the salutary spot at Islington fixed on by Dr. Fothergill and myself: the gentlemen whose continual opposition defeated the design, and adopted the expensive, dangerous and destructive scheme of transportation to Botany Bay, I leave to their own reflexions upon their conduct.

1788, July 13, Prisoners 24.

GUILDFORD. This bridewell not white-washed for some years: only one small day-room (ten feet two inches by seven feet) for men and women: the court paved with sharp flints: a pig sty in the court. Allowance, three halfpenny worth of bread (weight 15oz. and badly made): no straw or bedding: employment, removing gravel as in the two other bridewells: the work-room locked up. Keeper's salary, now £45 in lieu of the tap. (His son keeps a public house near).

KINGSTON TOWN GAOL.

[Kingston Town Gaol.]

No alteration: out of repair: not white-washed: a window towards the street; which I found locked up, because the prisoners were intoxicated. Keeper, no salary: has a licence for beer.

COUNTY GAOL at AYLESBURY.

[Aylesbury County Gaol.]

On the debtors' side are great improvements. They have now a separate court, and several good rooms. The felons have another day-room; but their side is close, particularly the bed-rooms, and they must ever be liable to the gaol-fever; the late gaoler died of it. The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up: no infirmary. Allowance to both debtors and felons 1½lb. of bread a day, and soup twice a week. Bedding and coals allowed also by the county. Transports have not the 2s. 6d. a week. Sixteen felons lately broke out: confinement in separate cells would prevent such escapes. Gaoler's salary £170, out of which he finds the prisoners soup.

1787, Nov. 29, Debtors 11. Felons &c. 24.

The following Rules for the Gaol were hung up.

BUCKS. MIDSUMMER SESSIONS, 1785.

1. Every prisoner, whether debtor or felon, shall be allowed one pound and a half of good bread per day, to be weighed to them on delivery, by weights to be provided by the county.

3. Every prisoner, whether debtor or felon, to receive on Sundays, and Thursdays, a pint of thick strong soup.

3. No strong liquors to be admitted into the prison, except wine, and strong beer or porter; the wine at the rate of one pint per day for each person, or one quart of strong beer or porter.

Norfolk Circuit. BUCKINGHAMSHIRE. 149

[Aylesbury Gaol.]

4. The cells to be washed every day, from the first day of May, to the first day of October, and every day by the prisoners in their turn, upon penalty of losing half a pound of bread, and their soup: and on every Sunday, all prisoners to attend chapel on the same penalty.

5. Every attempt to escape, for riot, or improper conduct, to be punished by confinement in the dark cells, at the discretion of the gaoler, on the allowance of one pound of bread only.

6. The cells to be opened from six to eight, from the first of May, to the first of October; and from day-break, to four o'clock in winter.

7. Two bushels of coals, for three days, to be allowed to debtors from the fifteenth of October, to the first of April; and the same to the felons.

8. Every part of the prison to be white-washed once in every year, after the summer assize.

9. All prisoners after conviction, except those ordered for execution, are to work in the same manner as those confined in the bridewell, upon penalty of losing half a pound of bread, and the soup.

10. No gaming to be allowed in the prison, and no garnish to be taken of a prisoner, under any pretence whatsoever.

11. No fees to be taken by the gaoler, of any sort or kind, either from the felons, or debtors, and the bedding to be provided for the latter by the gaoler gratis.

12. All persons going into the prison are to be searched by the gaoler, if he thinks fit, to prevent the introduction of liquors or tools.

13. No wife or child of the debtors or felons to sleep in the prison.

By the Court,

G. R. Minshull, Clerk of the Peace for the County of Bucks.

AYLESBURY. The new bridewell adjoins to the gaol. The-wall of the men's court is not secure. Each prisoner has a room (nine feet by eight and a half) and proper bedding. The Marquis of Buckingham kindly interested himself in the alterations both in this prison, and the county gaol. No allowance of coals. County gaoler is keeper. The prisoners here wished that the magistrates had made rules also for them.*

1787, Nov. 29, Prisoners 10.

The County Bridewell at Newport Pagnel was taken down in 1786, and petty offenders are now sent to the new county bridewell at Aylesbury.

BUCKINGHAM TOWN GAOL.

[Buckingham Town Gaol.]

This gaol built by Lord Viscount Cobbam, consists of the keeper's apartment, two rooms for debtors, and two for criminals: no dungeons.†

1788. Feb. 17, No Prisoners.

* It may be proper to premise, that though I visited all the county gaols in England, yet it is to be understood I did not in these late tours take all the county bridewells, as the attention of gentlemen has been of late so much exerted for the improvement of them, and as it was not the principal object I had immediately in view.

† I am sorry I shall have occasion so often to mention dungeons, in which prisoners are confined; for I always then mean, subterraneous dark cells.

150 BEDFORDSHIRE. Norfolk Circuit.

COUNTY GAOL at BEDFORD.

[Bedford County Gaol.]

No alteration in this prison. The men and women felons associate together; their night-rooms are two dungeons. Only one court for debtors and felons; and no apartment for the gaoler. Convicts have not the 2s. 6d.a week. A table of fees, and the act for preserving the health of prisoners are hung up; but rules and orders, and the clauses against spirituous liquors are not hung up: no infirmary: no bath: prison not kept so clean as in the former keeper's time. Coals allowed both to debtors and felons. Chaplain to the gaol and bridewell, the Rev. Mr. Crowe; his salary £40. Gaoler's salary £60 in lieu of the tap. The county proposes building a new gaol; a proper spot near the river, and not far from the sessions house, has been fixed on for that purpose.

BEDFORD. A new day-room, with a chimney, and sick room over it: the prison clean but not white-washed. Allowance, a half quartern loaf a day, and coals both in winter and summer. Employment, beating hemp; prisoners have their earnings. Keeper's salary £20. No fees. There should be solitary night cells: the court paved, the walls raised, and a pump set down.

1787, Nov. 30, Prisoners 5.

1788, Aug. 9, Prisoners 7.

HUNTINGDONSHIRE.

COUNTY GAOL at HUNTINGDON.

[Huntingdon County Gaol.]

The gaoler's salary is increased to £70 in lieu of the tap. Allowance, four half quartern loaves a week (weight of each in 1787 2lb. 6oz.): convicts have-not the half crown a week. No allowance for coals: on the felons' side no fire-place. Act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. No chaplain has been provided since the dismission of the zealous Mr. Brock in 1776: though I would hope from the books I found the prisoners reading, that some of them are well disposed.

* I shall here beg leave to make a short digression, in order to recommend to notice and imitation a Work-house situated in the adjacent parish of Cardington. This is a neat building, with lofty rooms ventilated by opposite windows, having detached, an infirmary, and various offices, as wash-house, bake-house, cow-house &c. together with a good garden and drying ground. The poor in it are neatly clad; and their diet, employment, and treatment in sickness and health, are all regulated with strict order and humane attention. The children are kept clean, and made cheerful and happy, in constant employment, yet not to the neglect of their instruction in what regards their best interest. It is to the unabating zeal and assiduity of a young lady, that this parish is indebted for the exemplary management of its poor.

CAMBRIDGESHIRE.

COUNTY GAOL, CAMBRIDGE CASTLE.

[Cambridge Castle.]

A good sized court for debtors is made out of the castle yard; and a small court for felons: this I am persuaded is little used: for at my visits I found them locked up, as is generally the case where the keeper lives at a distance. The felons have no fire-place; their rooms are close and offensive, especially the inner room for women. Transports have not the two shillings and sixpence a week. Acquitted prisoners are confined till the judge leaves the town. Chaplain, the Rev. Mr. Holmes, his salary £45; twenty pound of it is paid by lord Hardwick. The gaoler's salary is £50.

CAMBRIDGE Town Bridewell. No alteration. Prisoners have no use of the court. Allowance four-pence on Sunday, and to the sick, three-pence a day. The bedding improperly lies on the floors. Employment, spinning worsted: prisoners have what they earn. No allowance for coals, though more necessary where spinning is the only employment: but I have encouragement to hope that the present vice-chancellor will be so considerate as to make some allowance for coals, soap and other necessaries. No divine service.

ELY GAOL.

[Ely Gaol.]

No alteration. The felons' court not secure; but water being now laid in, I am persuaded, from the humanity of the bishop, they will have the use of it. Allowance now 1½lb. of bread. Neither clauses against spirituous liquors, nor the act for preserving the health of prisoners hung up. The gaol not white-washed for three years. Transports have not the two shillings and sixpence a week. - The iron bars and ring still remain in the room in which criminals were, formerly, cruelly confined. Gaoler's salary only £10.

COUNTY GAOL, NORWICH CASTLE.

[Norwich Castle.]

The gaoler's salary is £120 in lieu of the tap. All the apartments were clean. The felons were clothed in an uniform. - The convicts broke out in 1787, while the gaoler was at Thetford. This shews the impropriety of having the assize at a distance from the county gaol; and also the necessity of the nocturnal reparation of prisoners. Convicts now have not the 2s. 6d. a week, which the gaoler said they had a few years ago.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL.

[Bridewell.]

WYMONDHAM. The old prison is laid to the keeper's house, and two wings are built for the prisoners, containing thirteen arched cells, some of which are fifteen feet and a half by aix and a half, and nine feet and a half high, which open into a passage four feet and a half wide. Every man has his room, in which is a bed and proper bedding; here also, he works, beating, heckling, and spinning hemp.

There is also a mill for beating hemp and cutting logwood. - Here is an infirmary; and a chapel in which the Rev. Mr. Beevor kindly officiates every other Sunday. The prisoners have no use of the large court, but for washing themselves at the pump in the morning. The rooms were clean, and none of the prisoners in irons. Keeper's salary £62 and one fourth of the prisoners' earnings.

A list of the prisoners is made out for the inspection of the magistrates at every quarter sessions, containing - their names - crimes or offences - time when committed - by whom committed - for what time committed, and punishments to be inflicted - ages - distinction of sexes - trade or occupation - employment - behaviour - total earnings - and expense of maintenance.

Norfolk Circuit. NORFOLK. 153

[Wymondham County Bridewell.]

The diet table hung up; which is as follows. Breakfast; one penny loaf, household bread, every day. Dinner; Sunday, Hanway's ox cheek: Monday, a penny loaf: Tuesday, potatoes: Wednesday, boiled pease: Thursday a penny loaf: Friday, potatoes: Saturday, boiled pease.

They are allowed to rest half an hour at breakfast, an hour at dinner, and half an hour at supper; though no supper is given them. No other liquor than water is permitted, except in case of sickness, and when ordered by the surgeon. The weight of the penny loaf was 13oz. The allowance is too small for those who are confined several months, and kept constantly to work. They should be permitted to purchase milk and bread, at least, out of that part of their earnings to which they are entitled by Act of Parliament. Several young men seemed as if they could not go out so fit for labour, as they came in.

1788, Sept. 12, Men 12. Women 4.

I have been the more particular in my account of this prison, as it affords one of the best examples of the proper management of a house of correction, so as to render it a place of reformation for the idle and dissolute. It is to the unremitted attention of a neighbouring magistrate, Sir Thomas Beevor, that the public is indebted for the improvements in this house, and the strict execution of its salutary regulations. The other bridewells in this county, I understand, are on the same plan.

NORWICH CITY and COUNTY GAOL.

[Norwich Gaol.]

The gaoler's salary is £65; and now no illegal fee or gratuity is paid to the sheriffs. No free ward for poor debtors. The chamber rent is high: the price fixed over the door of each room as in the castle. The gaol very dirty: the rules not enforced. No proper separation of the sexes: this and several other defects I intimated to the magistrates who met me here in 1787, but there has been no alteration since, except in the infirmary.

The gaol-delivery for this populous city being only once a year, prisoners are often confined before their trials ten or eleven months. The Mayor, Sheriffs and Citizens have lately petitioned his Majesty, that the assizes may be at Norwich, twice a year. Surely there will be no denial to the justice and humanity of this petition. A county meeting-was also held on July 19th, 1788, for obtaining the removal of the Lent assize from Thetford to Norwich.

[City Bridewell.]

The magistrates visit this prison once a fortnight, and have been so considerate as to order that no prisoners should lodge in the dungeons. Several new cells are added, in which the prisoners work. Their employment is beating hemp, spinning, and cutting logwood. The task for cutting logwood is 56lb a day. The keeper's salary is £30,

and 2d. in the shilling of the prisoners' earnings. In 1788, I found two persons (committed for bastardy) playing at cards in the gaoler's kitchen, in the middle of the day. All cards and dice should be strictly prohibited in prisons.

The rules, and orders, which were hung up, are to be observed, and enforced at the Houses of Correction, in the County of Norfolk. These rules are in fourteen sections, but the first thirteen, being similar to those at Bury, and the fourteenth as the sixteenth order in that paper, I here omit them; as I shall give them under the article of Bury St. Edmund's.

The NORFOLK and NORWICH HOSPITAL.

[Norfolk Hospital.]

This spacious infirmary was perfectly neat and clean: the beds not crowded: the wards quiet and fresh; and the dietary hung up. A notable matron. There are about ninety beds: at my last visit fifty-two were occupied. If I might hint at a defect in an hospital which does honour to the governors, I would mention the impropriety of the wash-house being within the house, and the preservation of the urine as a perquisite of the nurses.

[Poor-houses.]

In this city there are two large poor-houses; and a new and good institution of spinning schools for children of both sexes, where they spin in the Scotch way.*

I visited also the hospital for aged persons, which was formerly a monastery, and given to the city by king Henry the Eighth. The house and lands are appropriated for an asylum to the aged of both sexes. Here were eighty-six persons who lodge in enclosed beds in halls, where I found all the windows shut. Some of them said they suffered this inconvenience from the obstinacy of one or two who lay in the same hall. It would be much better if each person had a room with a window, as at the hospital for old people at Edinburgh, page 77.

THETFORD TOWN GAOL.

COUNTY GAOL at IPSWICH.

[Ipswich County Gaol.]

This prison as usual, was very clean. The house is much quieter since the late Act; the felons having only small beer: and the magistrates have properly ordered, that no debtor shall have more than one quart of beer in a day; to which order the gaoler and turnkey strictly adhere. In consequence of the Act, and similar regulations, I have found in several prisons, fewer debtors. Here the number of insolvent debtors, on an average, was formerly fifteen; of late, not more than nine; and now it is reduced to seven. The gaoler's salary is now £200. The Rev. Mr. Bronte is still assiduous in his attention to the prisoners; frequently weighing the bread, and making his reports to the magistrates: and he sees that a proper distribution is made of Mr. Pemberton's charity. I was pleased with his observation, that he could not attribute the health and regularity of the prisoners in general, and their constant attendance at the chapel with great decency and devotion, to any other cause than to the total abolition of the tap.

* At several of my former visits to this town, I looked in at the poor-house; but generally finding it in a dirty and sickly condition, and affording no subject for imitation, in conformity to my usual custom, I passed it over in silence. I had now, however, the pleasure of finding this large house, containing three hundred and two persons, quite clean; the poor taking their meals in a clean and spacious hall, formerly a crowded bed-room; the old wooden testers removed; and the bed-rooms kept fresh and clean by washing twice a week. In such houses much depends on a neat and notable matron, who has humanity joined with firmness, and good sense enough to be directed by those who have more knowledge than herself. Such a woman is a treasure in an hospital or parish work-house.

I also visited a charity-school here, where I saw thirty fine healthy boys and twenty girls. I was pleased with a practice I observed of taking the boys to bathe in the sea, under the inspection of their master. This is done in a very orderly manner, three times a week, during the summer. Cold bathing, especially in salt-water, prevents many cutaneous and other diseases, promotes perspiration, and strengthens and invigorates the whole habit. It would also be useful to encourage the children in learning to swim on these occasions.

The infirmaries are close; and that for the men is badly situated. The work is not substantial; the wood being not seasoned, the planking on the sides of the rooms, and the floors are shrunk, so as to leave considerable interstices. (All such interstices are peculiarly improper in prisons and hospitals, as they afford a harbour for dirt, and are productive of ill scents). The outer wall is too low and the prison is not secure.

MIDLAND CIRCUIT.

WARWICKSHIRE.

COUNTY GAOL at WARWICK.

[Warwick County Gaol.]

The felons were sadly crowded. Only one small day-room for the men; and I saw thirty-two lie chained in a dungeon of twenty-two feet diameter, down thirty-one steps; two of whom were ill of a slow fever.* There were three others in a room, very ill, and in irons. In two rooms (seven feet and a half by six and a half) with apertures only in the doors, there lay fourteen women, almost suffocated. None of the women were now in irons. No infirmary: no bath. The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. No coals.† - Allowance, a three pound loaf every other day: it was good bread and full weight. Convicts have not the half crown a week. Acquitted prisoners are kept in irons till the judge leaves the town. Executions are at the gaoler's expense.‡ The prisoners receive yearly, from a legacy, £1: 10: 0, the rent of a house in the town. Some of the felons complained of having been forced to pay 4s. 1d. for garnish, or be stripped of their clothes. This is one of the bad effects of the admission of beer. The debtors pay for garnish a much larger sum. Gaoler's salary £60 in lieu of the tap.‖

1788, Feb. 15, Debtors 31. Felons &c. 51. Women Convicts 9.

* Before the convicts went off, who lately were ordered to Plymouth, this dungeon was so crowded that some of the poor wretches were forced to stand up (and take a sort of miserable night watch) while the others dept. From the aperture of this dungeon, which is three feet three inches wide (as from the door and the two funnels of the dungeon in the gaol at Stafford) the steam of the prisoners' breath comes out, in winter, like the smoke of a chimney.

† No coals being allowed, the women here, as in other gaols, aell even their bread to procure fuel.

‡ At Monmouth, Worcester, Warwick and most other county gaols, the expense of executions falls on the gaoler, though the charge is made by the sheriff in his bill of cravings. This I mention as an imposition on gaolers, which encourages them to indemnify themselves by impositions on their prisoners.

‖ If the tap had been sooner abolished, it might have saved the life of the late gaoler Roe, who died in the prime of life.

Midland Circuit. WARWICKSHIRE. 159

COUNTY BRIDEWELL.

[Warwick County Bridewell.]

WARWICK. A new Prison is finished and occupied. There are separate apartments, and courts with water, for men and women; and vagrants have a court and apartments separate from the other prisoners. Allowance, as in the gaol. No coals: no employment at present; but a long room, ten feet and a half wide is provided, with looms, and other materials for work.

1788, Feb. 15, Prisoners 10.

COVENTRY CITY and COUNTY GAOL.

[Coventry City Gaol.]

No alteration. The same bad dungeons: no proper separation of debtors, or men and women felons. An old house adjoining belongs to the corporation. Allowance to felons now a twopenny loaf of household bread (weight 1lb. 7oz.) Gaoler's salary £50 in lieu of the tap.

1787, Dec. 19, Debtors 10. Felons &c. 10.

CITY BRIDEWELL.

[City Bridewell.]

No alteration. Very dirty: several of the keeper's dogs in the rooms: court not secure: no employment: no rooms for faulty apprentices: no allowance for coals. Bread the same as at the Gaol. Keeper's salary £10.

1787, Dec. 19, Prisoners 8.

[BIRMINGHAM Town Gaol.]

BIRMINGHAM Town Gaol. The court is now paved with broad stones, but dirty with fowls. There is only one day-room for both sexes, over the door of which there is impudently painted Universal Academy.* Neither the act for preserving the health of prisoners, nor clauses against spirituous liquors are hung up. The gaoler has no salary, but has still a licence for beer.

1788, Feb. 14, Prisoners 13.

[Birmingham Court Prison.]

BIRMINGHAM Court Prison for Debtors. No alteration. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. Court of conscience debtors for sums under 20s. are now discharged in twenty days. As liquors are introduced by visiters, and through the windows which are towards the street, most of these prisoners think their confinement little or no punishment.

1788, Feb. 13, Prisoners 7.†

[Aston Gaol.]

ASTON Gaol, near Birmingham. Two damp dungeons down ten steps, and two rooms over them. - Court not secure. No water. Gaoler no salary: he keeps an ale-house.

1788, Feb. 15, Prisoners 5.

* There being no proper places for the confinement of idle and dissolute apprentices either here, or in the county bridewell at Warwick, the punishment for small offences is often omitted till unhappy youths are ruined. Some such young creatures I saw in the county gaol: and some of these boys I again met with on board the hulks. On this subject, see a note at Leeds.

† In the poor-house at Birmingham, the cielings of both the old and new parts are too low; but the rooms were dean; the provisions good; and great attention was paid to the numerous inhabitants.

160 LEICESTERSHIRE. Midland Circuit.

COUNTY GAOL at LEICESTER.

[Leicester County Gaol.]

The debtors' free ward is still a dungeon; their beds are on bedsteads; but the felons have only the county allowance of mats in their damp dungeons. One small court for debtors and felons. Keeper's salary £200, out of which he is to give each prisoner three pints of small beer a day. The gaol now clean and quiet. Garnish abolished. I have said, the Castle-hill near the shire hall, is a fine spot for air and water.

1787, 0ct. 25, Debtors 15. Felons &c. 14.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

[County Bridewells.]

LEICESTER. No alteration: very clean as usual. Keeper's salary £26: 5: 0; he pays land-tax and all other rates. Allowance, as in the county gaol, a fourpenny loaf every other day (weight 3lb. 1oz.)

1787, Oct 25, Prisoners 9.

MELTON-MOWBRAY. Two rooms. No court: no water. Keeper's salary only £4.

1788, Aug. 7, No prisoners.

1787, Oct. 25, Debtor 1. Felon 1.

COUNTY INFIRMARY at LEICESTER.

[County Infirmary.]

The ground floors are brick; the upper floors rough terrace; and none of the windows being open, the wards were very close. The under sashes are not moveable.

DERBYSHIRE.

COUNTY GAOL at DERBY.

[Derby County Gaol.]

Gaoler's salary is £140 in lieu of the tap. The prisoners are healthy, and the debtors are fewer since the sale of liquors has been abolished.* Here are three new cells (seven feet two inches by six feet nine). Escapes by ladders on the outside are now prevented, by a few courses of loose bricks laid on the stone coping. The convicts in several gaols, not being removed for a long time after their sentence, become desperate, and often break out, as they did lately at this prison. There were two women in the bridewell

* Mr. Simpson, and some of the most reputable gaolers have said, "it is a great happiness to this country that the taps are taken from the gaols," and they are pleased with the alteration; but especially their wives, as the prisoners are more quiet and orderly. Other keepers have said, "if my prisoners were to have no other drink but milk and water, they would enjoy better health." - I add, now, persons of reputation will more readily accept the important trust.

1787, Oct. 22, Debtors 7. Felons &c. 11.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

[County Bridewells.]

CHESTERFIELD. No alteration but the court enlarged. The prison on too contracted a plan. No allowance: no water. This might be made a good prison, and a current from the river be easily brought through it.

1788, Aug. 5, Prisoners 4.

TIDESWELL. An old house lately purchased. Prisoners were formerly confined in a room in the keeper's public house. No allowance. Keeper's salary £20.

1788, Aug. 3, No Prisoners.

[Derby Town Gaol.]

DERBY Town Gaol and Bridewell. Much improved. Here are three rooms for debtors, three for the bridewell, and two for felons, with bedsteads, straw and blankets; and a convenient court, water, and bath. Gaoler's salary £40, and £5 for the bridewell.

1787, Oct. 22, Debtor 1. Women Convicts 2.

[Chesterfield Gaol.]

CHESTERFIELD Gaol. The old prison is not used. Under the new town hall, which was finished last year, two close rooms, opening into a passage five feet wide, are designed for the prison. No court.

1788, Aug. 5, No Prisoners.

NOTTINGHAMSHIRE.

COUNTY GAOL at NOTTINGHAM.

[Nottingham County Gaol.]

At the entrance is this inscription on a board, "No ale, nor any sort of liquor sold within the prison." Gaoler's salary now £140. The prison too small. The debtors, in three rooms, pay 2s. a week each, though two in a bed. They who can pay only 6d. are in two rooms below, confined with such felons as pay 2s. a week. The other felons lie in two dark, offensive dungeons, down thirty-six steps, called pits, which are never white-washed.* Another dungeon in 1787 was occupied by a man sentenced to two years solitary confinement. The town transports and criminals are here confined with the county felons, which it may be hoped the magistrates will soon rectify. The room

* It is peculiarly necessary that all dungeons should be lime-whited twice a year: the lime being taken hot from the kiln, flacked in boiling water, and immediately used, freshens such damp places.

Committed by a Bi&op's Writ two neat women. One cannot but wish, that the Reformation, or Revolution, had done away that power of imprisonment.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL.

[County Bridewell.]

SOUTHWELL. On a stone tablet over the door is this inscription; "This house was built in the year 1656; and the new addition with the walls in 1787." There is now the old dungeon, a day-room, and court for felons, and several rooms and courts for the separation of the prisoners of different denominations, and also of the sexes; and very properly three cells for the refractory. Water in all the courts. The prisoners were unemployed: Allowance three halfpennyworth of bread; weight 1lb. Keeper's salary £45. Fees 3s. 6d.

1788, Aug. 6, Prisoners 11.

[Town Gaol.]

NOTTINGHAM Town and County Gaol. No alteration. The building is too slight for a prison. Windows towards the street. In the room (called the bars) on the ground floor, the prisoners may take in what liquor they please. No rules are hung up. Debtors pay 2s. a week for a bed. The county gaoler is keeper.

1788, Aug. 6, Debtors 5.

[Town Bridewell.]

NOTTINGHAM Town Bridewell. Four rooms are added; and a court is enclosed, to which the prisoners seldom have access. They were all locked up and unemployed. Allowance, a threepenny loaf every other day. Keeper's salary only £8. In 1788, there was a new keeper, and the prison much cleaner. Here is a mill for grinding beans, and on the outer-door was written, "Beans ground at a quarter."

1787, Oct. 23, Prisoners 14.

1788, Aug. 6, Prisoners 3.

Nottingham County Infirmary.

[County Infirmary.]

A neat hospital in a fine situation. The bedsteads were iron, and the furniture clean. Reservoirs of water were over the closets. The windows are (improperly) about three feet below the cielings. If new hospitals were annually lime-whited, especially the wards and passages, they would longer continue fresh and cheerful, as well as salutary to the patients.

Oct. 23d, 1787, Patients 44.

COUNTY GAOL, LINCOLN CASTLE.

[Lincoln Castle.]

No alteration in the old gaol. Allowance now 1½d. of bread; broth twice a day; 1d. on Sundays, and six chaldrons of coals a year. The keeper has an addition of £100 to his salary, for supplying the prisoners with their augmented allowance, and in lieu of the tap. Assize convicts have the half crown a week. Acquitted prisoners are not released till the clerk of assize delivers the calendar to the gaoler, after the judge has left the city, for which he receives of the gaoler a guinea, and his clerk five shillings.

A new gaol is built in the castle-yard, in which the passages will be close and dark, but there are no dungeons.

* The Spinning School is supported by a legacy of £700 left in 1686. The master has a salary of £30 to teach the children of the poor in this city to spin. There were about twelve spinning worsted in a large room. Mrs. Yorke the present Bishop of Ely's Lady, when she resided at Lincoln, frequently visited this school; and by her attention, and encouragements to the most cleanly and industrious children, it was then in a flourishing condition.

COUNTY GAOL at READING.

[Reading County Gaol.]

This prison is clean and quiet. Lord Craven and some of the justices visit this gaol and the bridewell, and enter their reports every month: yet there are no rules respecting the quantity of liquors permitted to debtors, which are particularly necessary where their court and that of the felons are divided only by open pallisades. Allowance three-pence a day in bread, either white or brown; (weight, of the former 2lb. 4oz. of the latter 2lb. 12oz.). Convicts have not the king's allowance of half a crown a week. Surgeon, for the gaol and bridewell, Mr. Baker; his salary £20. Chaplain, the Rev. Mr. Hodgkinson: salary £50 for the gaol and bridewell, and ten guineas from the corporation. The justices order their wages to be paid to him, which he very properly distributes among the prisoners. Gaoler's salary £100. No fees. £25 to the turnkey, who keeps a shop, and, no doubt, supplies the prisoners privately with liquors.

Mrs. Elizabeth Deane (who died on the 5th of July 1787) widow of H. Deane Esq. late of Reading, by will bequeathed £150 to the corporation, upon trust, to buy fire-wood for the county gaol. Accordingly on the 24th of November 1787, with this legacy £156: 17: 3 was purchased in the 4 per cents; and the dividends thereof arising, are to be laid out in the purchase of fire-wood, for the sole use and benefit of the prisoners who shall from time to time be confined in the county gaol of Berkshire, situate in Reading. A very humane benefaction!

Powney, Esq. of the Michaelmas general quarter sessions held at Reading, Oct. 7th 1783, in favour of Richard Read, a convict under sentence of transportation to Africa for seven years, who by a timely discovery, prevented the escape of his fellow prisoners, and for which discovery he received his majesty's full and free pardon."

Ordered, That the rules and regulations of the county gaol be published once in the Reading and Oxford newspapers, and a copy thereof put up in a conspicuous part of the gaol.

In order to prevent impositions or irregularities in the charges made by constables for conveying prisoners to the county gaol, - It is ORDERED by the Court, this present sessions, that the following allowance only be made in future by the county.

£. S. D.

For the Constable - 0 2 0 per day.

Guard, if necessary, - 0 1 6 ditto.

Subsistence for the prisoner - 0 1 0 ditto.

For conveying, if one. - 0 1 0 per mile.

If two, for each -  0 0 6 ditto.

If three, for each - 0 0 4 ditto.

And 4d. per mile for each, for any larger number.

Ordered, That no work be done to the gaol or bridewell, unless by an order under the hand of a visiting justice; or, in cases of necessity, of the chaplain.

[July 11, 1786.]

Ordered, That no money be at any time taken for the admission of persons to see the prisoner* in the gaol.

Ordered, That the gaoler be not only in general attentive to the regulations of the 20th of January last respecting strong liquors, but that he be particularly careful that no ale or other liquor, stronger than small beer, be conveyed to any convicts from the time of their conviction to their execution.

Oxford Circuit. BERKSHIRE. 169

[Berkshire Rules.]

Ordered, That the visiting justices do cause the debtors' begging window at the gaol to be secured in such manner as to them may appear most proper: and that the gaoler do not allow any communication between any debtor, whilst in the mumping room, and the rest of the prisoners.

Ordered, That the gate between the debtors' court and the court of the strong rooms called the middle kitchen, be always kept locked; and that the gaoler do never permit any felon to go amongst the debtors.

Ordered, That the rooms on the west-side of the gaol be allotted to the common debtors, and not set apart as master's wards, without the previous permission of the sheriff, or the visiting justices.

Ordered, That the gaoler and bridewell keepers do deliver, at every quarter sessions, an account of the county cloaths in their possession, agreeably to the following form.

Account of County Cloaths in the Gad at Reading, or House of Correction at Reading or Abingdon, at the Michaelmas Sessions, 1786, as the Case may be.

Articles; frocks, waistcoats, breeches, shirts, gowns, petticoats, shifts, stockings, shoes, and so if any other articles - Balance of last sessions - Provided since - Total - Worn out, &c. - Balance, 3d Oct. 1786 - Remarks ; if any cloaths have been lost or sent away with prisoners, &c. the particulars may be explained in this last column.

The foregoing rules are drawn up with so much care and attention by the magistrates, that I did not know how to do justice to them, either by abridging, or omitting any of them; which I hope will be my excuse to my readers.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL.

[County Bridewell.]

READING. A new prison, containing six close (called refractory) cells, nine feet and a half by seven and a half; eight solitary cells, ten feet by seven feet nine inches, with courts about the same size; and six wards for prisoners, who are permitted to be together. The rooms are furnished with bedsteads and straw mattresses, but no coverlets. The sewers make most of the rooms and courts offensive. Here is a chapel, where the worthy chaplain officiates twice a week. Allowance, a threepenny loaf daily (weight 2lb. 3oz.) and meat on Sundays. No employment. Keeper's salary £50. No fees. The names of the prisoners, and terms of confinement, are written on the doors of their cells. I observed some were for one year: a severe confinement, to be so long in solitude, unemployed, in nauseous cells, and without fire in winter.*

1788, July 12, Prisoners 17.

* I wish all prisoners to have separate rooms; for hours of thoughtfulness and reflection are necessary. The gentlemen of this county, by their building this house of correction, and in various other instances, have shewn themselves so attentive, and zealous in whatever may contribute to the real interests of their fellow creatures, that I am glad to take this occasion of making some remarks on solitary confinement. The intention of this, I mean by day as well as by night, is either to reclaim the most atrocious and daring criminals; to punish the refractory for crimes committed in prison; or to make a strong impression, in a short time, upon thoughtless and irregular young persons, as faulty apprentices, and the like. It should therefore be considered by those who are ready to commit, for a long term, petty offenders to absolute solitude, that such a date is more than human nature can bear, without the hazard of distraction or despair; that it is repugnant to the Act which orders all persons in houses of correction to work; and that for want of some employment in the day (as in several houses of correction) health is injured, and a habit of idleness or inability to labour in future, is in danger of being acquired. The beneficial effects on the mind, of such a punishment, are speedy, proceeding from the horror of a vicious person left entirely to his own reflections. This may wear off by long continuance, and a sullen insensibility may succeed.

WINDSOR Castle, Prison for Debtors. The discontinuance of this prison for some time was occasioned, probably, by the murder of the old keeper in the tap-room. It is now used as a prison, and there is no alteration in the six rooms for confinement.

COUNTY GAOL, OXFORD CASTLE.

[Oxford Castle.]

A prison is now building for a county gaol and bridewell, on Mr. Blackburn's plan. The very active and worthy magistrate, Mr. Willoughby, has put in practice Dr. Fothergill's favourite scheme of employing the convicts in building, which he had adopted ih regard to the intended Penitentiary Houses.* Here the lodges, and the gateway with the

* A list of prisoners in the county gaol and bridewell, from January 23d, 1786, to January 7th, 1787, was published, with an account of their earnings, expense of maintenance, materials for work &c. which was as follows:

Total Earnings - £198: 1: 11

Expense in Bread - £58: 19: 0

Ditto in Clothes and extra Feeding - 85: 1: 9½

Overlooker - 22: 10: 0

Materials for Work &c. - 11: 11: 0

Total Expense - 178: 1: 9½

Balance saved to the County - 20: 0: 1½

From January 7th, 1787, to January 1st, 1788, Balance saved to the County - £115: 9: 2

"The above report was made at the last Epiphany Sessions, and was then ordered to be printed, and to be sent to the Lord Lieutenant, the acting Magistrates of the county, the Foreman of the Grand Jury at the next Lent and Summer Assizes, and to the subscribers to the gaol charity." - To the honour of the Gentlemen of this county I quote what follows respecting this their well-directed charity. "And the treasurer of the subscription for pecuniary rewards on the discharge of industrious prisoners, having reported to the Magistrates then present, that there was a considerable balance in hand from the last year's subscription, it was agreed, that there was no immediate occasion to call on the subscribers; but that the Treasurer should have liberty to call on them for their annual subscriptions, when, and in such manner, as the Committee appointed to superintend the management of the castle gaol should think proper."

Some prisoners, when they are discharged, are completely clothed, have a little money in their pockets, and a good character given them, with a further promise that if they bring at the end of the year, a certificate from the master with whom they work of a good and sober character, they shall be further rewarded.

chapel over it, will be built entirely by the convicts. These were at work, and guarded only by one man, though several of them, for their good behaviour, had their irons taken off. This proves, that among such delinquents many are reclaimable, and not so entirely abandoned as some are apt to suppose. (They were going to work on the navigation). The encouragements here given with respect to their diet, clothes, and term of confinement, have been the means of recovering many from their bad habits, and of rendering them useful members of society. Here the convicts are not defrauded of the king's allowance of 2l. 6d. a week.

In my former edition of The State of the Prisons, his Majesty's kind donation of £200 for the discharge of insolvent debtors at Salisbury was inserted. His gracious Majesty lately left £300 at Oxford for the same humane purpose; by which bounty twenty-six debtors out of twenty-seven were released: all their creditors, one only excepted, readily coming into the composition, and the twenty-seventh received £25, to recover a debt for the benefit of himself and his creditors. With pleasure I mention this proper and faithful application of the money, well knowing that part of the donation at Salisbury was spent for the benefit of the gaoler's tap.

The felons lodge in the old castle. Here all the rooms were much cleaner and fresher than I had seen them at my former visits. One of the regulations is, that no visiters shall be admitted on Sundays; which would be very proper in all gaols, as that is, too generally, a day of confusion and intoxication. This is remarkably the case in the prisons at London. The new gaoler's salary is £105.

1787, Nov. 26, Debtors 12. Felons &c. 24.

OXFORD City Gaol is now building. Mr. Blackburn is the architect. It is intended for a gaol and bridewell. The city prisoners are in the county gaol, and in the bridewell.

OXFORD City Bridewell. Two rooms on the second floor; that for the women only seventeen feet by nine, and seven feet high, in which were seven prisoners, and frequently there are many more: court not secure: prisoners never let out but for a few minutes. Allowance, two quartern loaves a week. No employment: no coals: no bedding.

OXFORD RADCLIFFE INFIRMARY.

[County Hospital.]

I am sorry that I must repeat my remarks on the closeness and offensiveness of four out of the five large wards of this county hospital, viz. three of the men's and the lower one of the women's. None of the windows of the staircases were open; the upper sashes are fixed; as is one part of the sashes in several of the wards. The dry-rubbing of the floors, which is too generally practised in hospitals, is almost as bad as hiding the dirt with sand. Here is a convenient and good bath; and, very properly, the wash-house and brew-house are detached buildings.

[Banbury Gaol.]

BANBURY Town Gaol and Bridewell. No alteration. The prisoners are not permitted to have any fire, their bedding being straw. Keeper now pays no rent, and has a salary of £15 in lieu of the tap.

172 WORCESTERSHIRE. Oxford Circuit.

COUNTY GAOL, WORCESTER CASTLE.

[Worcester Castle.]

Here are eighteen new cells and a day-room for men, and two cells and a day-room for women felons, and over these, two rooms, with small windows for women-debtors. The workmen were repairing the dungeon, in the court. In each of the cells, felons (very improperly) lie together on the floors. These cells were dirty; and the apertures for air were all stopt, through the inattention of the gaoler. Debtors and felons are in one court: this should be divided: and there is only one day-room for felons and convicts: these should have separate day-rooms and courts. Convicts have not the half crown a week.

The two sick-rooms are badly contrived; one of which has no window. The late keeper and his wife who succeeded him, both died of the gaol-fever.* Acquitted prisoners are kept in irons till the judge leaves the city, when the gaoler pays 2s. for each, and 12s. 6d. for the calendar. - The gaoler is a butcher, and lives some miles distant; and his son, a young man, has the care of this large prison. Salary £150 in lieu of the tap.†

* In the course of my pursuits, I have known also several amiable young gentlemen, who, in their zeal to do good, have been carried off by that dreadful disorder, the gaol-fever; and this has been one incentive to my endeavours for its extirpation out of our prisons. I shall mention one affecting instance which happened here, of a young physician falling a sacrifice to this distemper through a benevolent attention to some prisoners afflicted with it, as the circumstance is related by Dr. Barnes in the Manchester Memoirs, vol. II. p. 85. "Dr. Johnstone junior, of Worcester, has lately fallen a much lamented martyr to a noble discharge of duty, in attending the prisoners ill of a fever in Worcester jail (1783). He attained, at an early period, to great and deserved eminence in his profession: and will be ever regretted as a physician of great ability and genius, and as one of the most pleasing and benevolent of men; prematurely snatched from his friends and country, when become highly agreeable and useful to them." - And yet, alas! the dreadful dungeon here, the planks of which were perished by damp and the breath of prisoners, was at my last visit preparing again for the reception of others.

† His Majesty, in his late visit to this city, very humanely left £300 to be applied to the releasing of debtors from confinement. I could have wished he had made such a kind visit to this castle as he did at Oxford.

STAFFORDSHIRE.

COUNTY GAOL at STAFFORD.

[Stafford County Gaol.]

No alteration in this crowded prison. Only one small day-room for men and women. In the dungeon for male felons, I saw fifty-two chained down, hardly fourteen inches being allowed to each. The moisture from their breath ran down the walls. I need not intimate the heat and offensiveness of this dungeon, and the paleness of the prisoners. The women were in irons, and lay in another dungeon. Last year, seven of the felons died in their dungeon of the gaol-fever: and the free-ward, or county chamber, being directly over it, nine out of thirteen of the poor debtors died. No infirmary: no bath. Act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. Though this prison is bad and crowded, many things might be done by an attentive and humane gaoler for the convenience and health of his prisoners, consistently with his own security. One debtor's attempting to escape was not a sufficient reason why a window should be bricked up in the county chamber, which before was too dark and close. A lofty and good room with a fire-place, over the women's dungeon, was kept during the sickness, and is still retained, for the gaoler's lumber. I am sorry that when this circumstance was publicly mentioned, some gentlemen should so readily acquiesce in the gaoler's excuse that the room was not secure. It is a strong room: but even admitting it not so strong as the dungeon, it is sufficiently secure for some who are not the most atrocious criminals, and especially such as are sick, or in dying circumstances. Allowance, two shillings, in fifteen penny loaves and a 2lb.of cheese a week. The bread was good and of proper weight. Convicts have the two shillings and sixpence a week. Gaoler's salary £100 in lieu of the tap.* The county is now going to build a new gaol.

COUNTY GAOL at SHREWSBURY.

[Shrewsbury County Gaol.]

No alteration in this close prison. Women in irons, though confined to their day-room and dungeon; the men double ironed, and chained to the floor at night.† No infirmary.‡ Allowance 3d. a day in bread. The gaol is served by two bakers, one appointed by the county, the other by the sheriff. The weight of their sixpenny loaf was only 4lb. 4oz. when the weight at the bridewell was 4lb. 12 or 13oz. and of the same bread in the town 4lb. 13oz. The convicts have 2s. and a sixpenny loaf every Saturday. Acquitted prisoners are not discharged in court. A publican with cans of beer was waiting on Sunday, in the inside, to serve the prisoners. This county obtained an act 26 Geo. III.

I cannot but lament; as it is one great and obvious reason why our prisons are so crowded both with debtors and felons. Many magistrates are sensible of this evil, yet so dreadfully supine and timid, as to grant fresh licences (often at the intercession of their interested clerks) in which their conduct is highly culpable. It should be remembered, that it is the spirit of our laws, and therefore the duty of magistrates, by every means to prevent, if possible, the commission of crimes.

* Such a quantity of cheese is improper in prisons. For the 9d. a week here in milk, oatmeal, potatoes or other vegetables, they might have a hot mess almost every day.

† I have often wished that gentlemen would make Rules for the conduct of gaolers, as well as for prisoners, and many gaolers have wished for such rules. New keepers would then be informed that steady discipline, and strict regularity will do more to keep prisoners in health, and prevent the commission of crimes in gaols, than severity and oppression. I have often thought that a sober, humane, half-pay officer would make one of the best gaolers.

‡ The late gaoler's charge to the county for the sick, for four years, in wine &c. was £386: 15: 0½, exclusive of the surgeon's and apothecary's bills. Probably, if a tenth part of it had been allowed for clothes, linen, soap, and other necessaries for cleanliness, with proper bedding and nourishment, it would have saved the lives of many of our fellow creatures.

Allowance three pennyworth of bread a day: to convicts a twopenny loaf and two pence in money. Acquitted prisoners are not released till the judge leaves the city. Neither the act for preserving the health of prisoners, nor clauses against spirituous liquors are hung up; nor rules, which now become more necessary, to restrain the free admission of liquors. Women convicts continue in this, and other gaols, longer than the men - some even four or five years. I found that most of the women felons were in heavy irons,* but they were taken off the next day.

* This indecent, wanton, and cruel custom of putting irons on the weaker sex in prisons, is not practised in any of the most uncivilized countries that I have visited.

† In this city, and many other places, the bakers make only the white bread. The assize here from the 4th to 11th of February 1788 was, the twopenny loaf standard wheaten, 1lb, 5oz, 6 drams, the sixpenny loaf 4lb. 3 drams. So that the poor are almost obliged to buy dear and fine bread.

‡ In the work-house for the city, the rooms and the inhabitants were clean, having a notable matron. With respect to health and conveniences in work-houses and infirmaries, more depends on such women than is generally imagined.

The felons are chained to the floor at night. Acquitted prisoners are detained in irons till the clerk of assize delivers the calendar to the gaoler, after the judge has left the town; for which the gaoler pays 12s. 6d. and 2s. for every such prisoner. Each prisoner receives a sixpenny loaf every quarter day from Mr. James Gabriel's kind donation, who died the 26th of March, 1754.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

[County Bridewells.]

WINCHESTER. A new and spacious prison (the foundation stone laid June 7, 1786, finished Nov. 6, 1787) which has four courts, and a pump in each court; a chapel, and infirmary. There is a good house for the keeper, and the prison is kept very clean. Keeper's salary £100 in lieu of all fees, and £30 for the turnkey. The prisoners' names and terms of confinement are hung on the doors of their solitary cells. Allowance, 1½d.in bread, a day, and to those that work 2d. more. The prison is constantly visited by a worthy nobleman in this city.

County Hospital at Winchester.

[County Hospital.]

In this Hospital all the windows of the passages and staircase were shut, and the under (or venereal) wards were dirty, close and offensive. The bedsteads are iron, and painted green: the furniture blue and white. The patients, who are able to sit up, dine very properly in a room adjoining to their wards. Here, and in several of our county hospitals, I could wish there were large apertures over the doors (as in the London hospital) to prevent, in part, the offensiveness of the wards at night.

* I am persuaded that in this, Warwick, Brecon, and several other gaols, debtors now sell beer.

† Out of the gate of this city, there is a pillar erected (as a memorial of a dreadful plague that swept off a great number of the inhabitants) upon the spot to which provisions were then brought for the supply of the city.

The Royal Hospital at Haslar near Gosport.

[Haslar Hospital.]

I always found this well-conducted hospital remarkably clean and quiet, and (what is very different from the practice in the county hospitals) none of the floors were sanded, or dry rubbed, and the windows on all the staircases were open.* The patients have white linen shirts and the hospital clothes; and the linen of the beds is white. In this hospital there are about eighteen hundred beds, nineteen or twenty in general in a ward. The wards are sixty feet by twenty-four, and the height twelve feet, on two floors, and ten on the third, and the arcades below are twenty-four feet wide. All the nurses here, and in the hospital at Plymouth, are women, which is very proper, as they are more cleanly and tender; and they more easily pacify the patients, who are seafaring men. Visiters are admitted, very properly, only on two days in a week. The staircases are spacious, but they are of wood: the rises are too high; and there is no hand-rail on the wall. The inside sewers are offensive: there are no cisterns in the wards: the pipes by which they are supplied with water, both for drink and walking, adjoin (indelicately) to the sewers. The two cells for lunatic patients are too close and badly situated. The cieling of the attic floor is too low (seven feet); when the hospital is new roofed, it may be raised with little additional expense. To each wing there should be a sea-bath; and a circulation of air is as absolutely necessary through the centre of the front as in the wings. If there were apertures into the passages, near the cieling, they would keep the wards fresh at night. Under several of the wards there are cellars for wood, lumber &c. which are dangerous in case of fire. For security against fire and infectious disorders I prefer the hospital at Plymouth, a plan of which is in my former work.

Some of the principal offices, such as the dispensary, water-works, wash-house, bed-house and fumigating-cells, being very properly detached buildings, are not in the plan which I give of this hospital at Haslar. See plate xix.

* Dr. Lind long since informed me, that he had the sash windows on the staircases nailed up in summer, to prevent their being shut.

The following Regulations and Orders were hung up in the Wards.

REGULATIONS Respecting the Nurses and other Servants of the Royal Hospital at Haslar.

ORDERED,

[Haslar Regulations.]

[Haslar Regulations.]

day; and in these wards, a small chink of the upper part of some one or more of the windows is constantly to be kept open, so as at night gently to move the flame of a candle when standing on the table, unless otherwise ordered by the physician: The proper patients only are to come into these wards, and no others whatever.

XIV. That no cards, or gaming of any kind, be permitted in the hospital.

XV. That such nurses as can be spared by the matron, go to chapel every Sunday; and that the nurses take care, that such patients as are able do attend divine service whenever it is performed; and report to the physician or surgeon, such persons as neglect going there.

ORDERS To be observed by the Patients in the Royal Hospital at Haslar.

I. No one shall be guilty of blasphemous expressions, unlawful swearing, curling, drunkenness, uncleanness, lying, or other scandalous actions, to the corruption of good manners, and in derogation of God's honour.

COUNTY GAOL at SALISBURY.

[Salisbury County Gaol.]

The debtors' lodgings are very high; 2s. 6d. a week for each, though two in a bed. On the felons' side there are three floors, and on each eight cells (some about ten feet and a half by six and a half, and nine feet high to the crown of the arch) which open into narrow passages, hardly three feet wide. The cells being too few, when the felons are numerous, two or three are crowded into one cell. This was the case in 1784 when seventeen prisoners and one turnkey died of the gaol fever. The felons then were kept in close confinement: now they are out only one hour in a day. Act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up: no bath, though the prison is so conveniently situated, being near a fine stream of water. The gaol not white-washed since the sickness in 1784. Here the acquitted prisoners that are poor are kept in irons till the judge leaves the town, but others are immediately discharged.

No part of this prison is now a bridewell; yet the warrants are expressed "to be kept to hard labour." The stable and cart-house still continue, though many common-side debtors and petty offenders are crowded into a smoky room adjoining. Surgeon, Mr. Robert Still; salary now £21. Gaoler's salary only £50. Often have I wished, that all fees were abolished.

MARLBOROUGH. This prison is almost new: now having - for the men, two work or day-rooms, and two bed-rooms: a spacious court and water: - for the women, a work-room and two bed-rooms, with a court and water. In the work-rooms were rollers and towels. No employment. Keeper's salary £60, out of which he supplies each prisoner with two pennyworth of bread a day. Surgeon's salary £10. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. The rules, the same as at the Devizes, are hung up, of which I here copy one article; "That the prisoners be obliged to sweep out and clean their rooms every day, and that they also wash their faces and hands, at least twice in every day, for which purpose towels and water tubs are to be conveniently placed for them." In the old prison, at two of my former visits, I found the gaol-fever; and since the year 1782 the keeper and surgeon died of it; but now there is little danger of such accidents.†

SALISBURY City Gaol. The property of the Bishop. In a ruinous condition.

1787, Nov. 17, No Prisoners.

July 3d, 1788, it was taken down, and the corporation intend to build a court-room on the spot; and I hear they propose sending their felons &c. to the county gaol; which I hope the county magistrates will prevent their gaol being too small for the general number of their own prisoners.

* A prisoner, Thomas Plat, lately died in one of the solitary cells, and the verdict of the coroner's jury was, died by hunger and cold. Since this, the allowance was augmented as above.

† The work-house for St. Peter's parish in Marlborough, adjoining to the bridewell, is quite out of repair, and the clay floors in holes. The rooms and inhabitants were very dirty, and had no linen or means of cleanliness. They had little or no bedding: some lay on straw on the floors, and others had a few rags to cover them on old bedsteads. It is no wonder that a putrid fever lately ran through this house. The other poor-house, in St. Mary's parish, is equally neglected: three or four lay in a bed with only rags and straw, and some of the children were almost naked. - Parish officers so inattentive to what humanity and decency require, expose the inhabitants of whole towns to the danger of contagious disorders, by such objects wandering about the streets. I have in a former publication, mentioned an instance of a foreign gaoler being made an example of (being hanged) for starving his prisoners. Is not a breach of trust in overseers of the poor, equally culpable and injurious?

COUNTY GAOL at DORCHESTER.

[Dorchester County Gaol.]

A new gaol, on a bad plan, and slightly built. A much better plan was proposed by Mr. Pitt, but it was over-ruled. The rooms for debtors very dirty: no free ward: not white-washed, though the act for preserving the health of prisoners is hung up. Allowance to both debtors and felons 1½lb. of bread a day. It was weight; but of bad quality, and not well baked, though the county pays for the best. The convicts have not the 2s. 6d. a week, though I suspect it is charged in the bill of cravings: here and in several other counties, this article in the under-sheriffs bills should be examined. Acquitted prisoners are kept in gaol in irons till the judge leaves the town, unless certain fees be paid to the clerk of the crown, cryer &c. but if the fees be paid, they are immediately discharged; for such as have money have no fear of detention for other indictments. Gaoler's salary £60 and £40 for turnkeys.

Those committed to hard labour are locked up in solitary cells, and out only one hour in a day, which seems to be, in several places, the magistrates' mode of curing the prisoners of their habits of idleness.

HIGH GAOL at EXETER.

[Exeter High Gaol.]

I had the pleasure to find that the proprietor, John Denny Roll Esq. has given £1000 towards a new gaol, which will be now under the direction of the county magistrates by an Act of Parliament. Neither the late gaoler, Waber, who died of the gaol-fever, nor his widow who kept the gaol one year after him, nor the present gaoler have received any money from the county for the fees of acquitted prisoners; according to the act, though they have paid Mr. Follet, the clerk of the crown, his demand for the Judges' Calendars.

There were three women in their sick room, and I was surprised at finding with them a shoe-maker at work at his trade. On inquiring into the cause, I was informed that he was the husband of one of the women who was committed Sept. 1st 1785, and on the 20th of March 1786 was sentenced to be transported for seven years, for stealing a

calfs skin. In Nov. 1786 she was ordered to the hulk at Plymouth, but on account of lameness contracted by a fever in the gaol, she could not be removed: a fine child, which is her fifteenth, was born in the prison. Her husband persisted in declaring he would never leave her, but would go abroad with her. Such constancy of affection in prisons is very uncommon in men, though I have frequently found it in the other sex. - But by the kindness of Lord Sydney, the woman received a free pardon Dec. 27th, 1787: and I since learn that this couple are useful and worthy members of the community.

Here the assize convicts have the 2s. 6d. a week; but those convicted at the sessions only the county allowance of 22oz. of bread, which was good, and full weight. The under-sheriff in his late bill of cravings charged the same for both; but the latter was not allowed. However the county indemnified the gaoler, who had paid the 2s. 6d. a week to the session convicts. Prisoners indicted for felony and acquitted at the assize, are not immediately discharged, as ordered by the late Act, but are kept in prison several days, till the judge leaves the town; unless the clerk of the crown hand over a paper to the gaoler as an intimation that his fees are paid: then there is no pretext of detention made, for fear of other indictments being brought against them.

I found at my last visit that the gaoler's salary is now £100, and that the county proposes to build a new gaol, for which a situation is chosen, much better than that of the present gaol.*

SHERIFF'S WARD, EXETER.

[Sheriff's Ward.]

The frequent broils between the keeper and his prisoners for two or three years past shew the necessity of rules and orders for prisoners and keepers being fixed by parliament. I put the same question here, that I had proposed at York, Durham, Newcastle, Nottingham, Leicester, Norwich &c. namely, what was the number of debtors who had flung themselves into prison, through the hope of an insolvent act during this year (1787) and who had settled with their creditors, and gone out, on finding that the bill did not pass? The number was twenty, and their names were given me; but he said, that the number was greater in 1786, when an insolvent bill was thrown out.

I am sensible however that there are real objects of compassion in many of our prisons, who are even in want of the necessaries of life, having no allowance; no friends. Such is William Luckis, who has been here confined since April 1786 under a heavy treble penalty, on a conviction for smuggling: he was only a hired servant to a farmer, and when he came in was a hale young fellow, but is now much thinner through want; yet, such unfortunate persons, being king's fines, insolvent bills exclude.

* I would make my acknowledgments to the gentlemen of this county, for the kind and polite notice they were pleased to take of me at the quarter sessions in August last, relative to my suggestions on a new county gaol. I freely acknowledge my views, for many years, did not extend far from the old gaol, and it was the gentlemen themselves, or their ingenious architect Mr. Blackburn, that found out a much better situation to build on.

The ROYAL HOSPITAL near PLYMOUTH.

[Royal Hospital.]

This noble hospital would admit of some improvements, particularly, a receiving-room, as hinted before in The State of the Prisons. The most proper situation of a receiving-room for patients is near the landing-place, between the house appropriated for the patients' chests and bedding, and the fumigating-house: in this room, furnished with a copper, bathing tub &c. the patients should be washed, and their own clothes carried to the fumigating-house, if necessary,† without being brought into the hospital:

* The poor-house for this opulent city, is finely situated on a rising ground out of the city. There were in it about six hundred persons; but it was not clean: the windows were almost all shut: no reparation of the young and old: there seemed to be no proper management; and there were no rules hung up.

† It has been found that the fumes of a small quantity of brimstone in the fumigating room will not destroy all the vermin in clothes; but three pound and a half will effectually do it in twenty-four hours.

188 CORNWALL. Western Circuit.

[Plymouth Hospital.]

after this, being furnished with the hospital-dresses, they should be examined and sent to their proper wards, from a door to be broken through the wall of the hospital: with such precautions, it is obvious that the hazard of spreading contagion must be much lessened.

A window should be made near the door of each ward, and opposite the window in the lobby, for the better ventilation of the wards.

Two pavilions at the entrance of the hospital, contiguous to the steward's and agent's offices, are wanted - for a council-room, and for the purpose of surveying invalids; the present one being inconvenient, and subjected to noxious smells on account of its situation in a narrow passage up one pair of stairs - likewise, for apartments for assistant-surgeons and assistant-dispensers in time of war, who, for reasons too obvious to mention, ought to sleep within the hospital.

The chapel should be on the ground floor; it is now up stairs, and the deling is too low. It might be converted into a dispensary, much more convenient than that used at present, which is too dark, and not sufficiently large for the purpose.

A nurse's room or cabin injures several of the wards: the others are more free and open.

No casements to the windows in the passages; and the floors are of soft brick. The assize convicts have the king's allowance of half a crown a week.

BRISTOL NEWGATE.

[Bristol Newgate.]

This close prison was white without and foul within. The dungeon and several rooms very dirty.‡ The bath used as a vault. No allowance for mops, brooms, or towels

* I hope I shall be excused in repeating what I have had occasion to mention with respect to many prisons, that there is no bath, though baths are ordered in all gaols by the Act for preserving the health of prisoners. I would here also remind gentlemen, that when baths are provided in compliance with the act, if they be not made convenient, so that felons in their irons may commodiously use them; and if there be no allowance for soap and towels; these prisoners will receive very little if any benefit from them, and will never bathe but when actually compelled.

† In most of the county gaols I have, in my late tours, inquired of the gaolers, how many debtors they candidly thought had flung themselves into their gaols, on what are called friendly actions, and who on the insolvent bill not passing have gone out? After some deliberation, they have told me the number; and some have added, "Few people know how much this country is obliged to the Chancellor for his opposing the insolvent bills."

‡ I am generally most attentive to the dungeons and rooms of the felons: for, though the debtor apartments are often equally dirty, yet, besides having other privileges, their rooms are opened sooner, and shut much later: it is seldom that any contagious disorder begins with them,

to the prisoners. Here, and in the bridewell, were several dogs of visiters and others. Such dirty animals should never be admitted where attention to cleanliness is so necessary to the health of the inhabitants. Clauses against spirituous liquors not hung up. The admission of such liquors cannot be prevented, while both debtors and felons constantly beg at the grates. The allowance still to felons only a penny loaf before trial, and a twopenny loaf after conviction: (weight of this in 1787 1lb. 7oz.). Keeper's salary £200. At my last visit the prison was much cleaner.

BATH INFIRMARY.

[Infirmary.]

May 29th 1788. Cleaner and fresher than at my visit last year: several windows open; but many of the upper sashes do not let down, nor do any of those in the passages or staircases; which is the more necessary in such close and confined places as the site of this infirmary.†

[Bridgewater Gaol.]

BRIDGEWATER Town Gaol. The room in which prisoners from the county gaol are confined during the assize is twenty feet by eighteen feet nine inches. Here, the gaoler said he had sometimes thirty prisoners, who were almost stifled. Only one window; another that was opposite being stopped up. The gaoler pays the hard tax on windows, £3: 15: 6. Salary none: has license for beer.

1788, June 30, Debtors 3.

* The Bristol Infirmary now building in the close and confined situation of the old one, will be a monument of the unskilfulness of the subscribers, or of their inattention to what constitutes a healthy hospital, when a fine situation was proposed, at no great distance, and was strongly recommended by the gentlemen of the faculty.

Colston's hospital for one hundred boys. Their uniform is blue with an orange-coloured lining. The school and bed rooms were clean: the boys looked healthy: every thing regular and in order. The daily allowance of bread (which weighed only 12oz.) is too scanty. They have 6oz. at dinner, three for breakfast, and three for supper. (The bread allowance was lately increased to the boys at Christ Church Hospital London.)

† I am generally attentive to the staircases and passage windows in hospitals, that the wards, by apertures, (as at Leeds) may be freshened from them. I have often mentioned the upper sashes being fixed; for if lofty and moveable, the smallest opening produces a circulation of the stagnant air, and that so imperceptibly to the patients, that there is little danger of either the nurses, or them shutting the windows.

COUNTY GAOL, YORK CASTLE.

[York Castle.]

The felons' cells are now floored with unseasoned oak. Their court is properly paved with broad stones, and the drain is carried through the vault, so that the passage is not offensive: there are also iron palisades in the castle yard, to prevent access within ten feet of the court. Water is laid in, but there is no bath. Here I found the present bread-inspector, Mr. Watson, who has a salary of twenty guineas a year; and I have often wished there were such a person to inspect, weigh, and deliver the bread to prisoners in London. No rules or orders relative to the admission of liquors. Gaoler's salary £300 in lieu of the tap.

YORK CITY and COUNTY GAOL.

[City Gaol.]

There are four cells for the felons, down sixteen steps; only one day-room, in which a boy for picking pockets was an associate with two highwaymen. On my mentioning to the gaoler that liquors were given from the street in at the debtors' windows, he replied, I cannot help their being often intoxicated.

* Both debtors and felons are here employed, as at Lincoln castle, Norwich castle, Ipswich, and some few other gaols, in making garters, purses, nets, laces, &c. many of the debtors have plain cheap machines for weaving garters, similar to those at Lincoln. It always gives me pleasure to find prisoners employed, as they are then more healthy: it also diverts them, and is a mean of procuring them clean linen, or a little milk, or meat to their bread; and I remember an old gaoler's observation, "that it kept his prisoners out of mischief."

LEEDS INFIRMARY.

[Infirmary.]

This is one of the best hospitals in the kingdom. In the wards, which are fifteen feet eight inches high, there is great attention to cleanliness; and six circular apertures or ventilators open into a passage five feet and a half wide. There are no fixed testers: no bugs in the beds. Many are here cured of compound fractures, who would lose their limbs in the unventilated and offensive wards of some other hospitals.‡

* In my various tours, I have often heard of the death of one or more prisoners by intoxication and quarrels in prisons. Here one had lately been unhappily killed.

† In all manufacturing towns it would be proper to have solitary cells for the confinement of faulty apprentices and servants for a few days, where they should be constrained to work, and have no visiters unless clergymen: for a short term would probably do more to effect a reformation, than three or four months confinement; as it is generally found that in the first two or three days prisoners seem to have their minds most affected and penitent.

A county magistrate said, "we have thought it necessary to refrain from commitment in many cases where that mode of proceeding would otherwise have been salutary, from a full persuasion of the total unfitness of the places of confinement or of correction, to answer those reformatory purposes for which a well-regulated restraint is peculiarly calculated."

‡ Here is a well-regulated work-house, which I found at this, and at my former visits, clean and quiet. There were 49 men, 65 women, 38 boys and girls. The provisions were good of the sort, and the dietary may be acceptable to some of my readers.

Kingston upon HULL TOWN and COUNTY GAOL.

[Hull Town Gaol.]

The old gaol is disused, and a new one is built in a fine situation out of the town; which, with some small alteration, would be a good gaol. The mayor and aldermen attentively inspect it, each in his month, and write their observations in a book. Allowance, 3d. a day. A worthy clergyman attends on Wednesdays, without salary.* No licence for beer: no salary to the gaoler. The rules which were hung up I here copy.

1788, Jan. 14, Debtors 12. Felons &c, 4.

Dinner. Tuesday, Dumplings and beer.

Wednesday, Bread, cheese and beer.

Thursday, Beef and broth, bread and beer.

Friday, The same as Monday.

Saturday, Milk pottage and bread.

Supper. Sundey and Thursday, Bread and broth, or broth and beer.

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, Milk pottage and bread.

The proportion of bread, for each meal, is one wheat cake, weight 3lb. divided into eight parts, viz. two of 7oz. for men, four of 6oz. for women, and two of 5oz. for children.

The proportion of flesh meat, is 16lb. of beef or mutton for twenty persons, on an average.

Ditto 1lb. of rice and 10oz. of sugar, with pimento, salt and flour for ditto.

Ditto 14oz. of paste each dumpling for adults, and 8oz. for children.

Ditto one gallon of milk for pottage for twenty persons.

Ditto one third of a quart (ale measure) of beer at each dinner, Saturday excepted.

Ditto 6oz. of cheese for adults, and 4oz. for children. With full liberty to adults to exchange their portion of beer for bread, or bread for beer.

At this, and several other work-houses, I collected the rules and orders for the better government of the poor; on which, not being the main object in view, I make no observations.

* In the poor-house there were fifty-four men, one hundred and three women, sixty-four boys, and fifty-four girls. The house and the numerous inhabitants were, as at my former visits, clean and neat. The placidness of their countenances bespoke the attention of the notable matron Mary Ecken, who has been there thirty-one years.

I would lay great stress on the regular catechising of children in all work-houses twice a week. This exercise might be highly beneficial also to many older persons there, who are very ignorant, and I am fully persuaded can receive but little advantage from attending upon public worship and hearing sermons there, without some more easy and familiar instruction, to inform their minds, and enlarge their comprehension. - On catechising likewise, and plain, serious, familiar discourse on the great practical principles and duties of religion, the beneficial effects of Sunday schools will in a great degree depend. - Pilfering and stealing are frequently owing at first to the want of proper instruction in early life; and these naturally lead to the commission of more enormous offences; for, corrupt as our nature is, robbery and murder are seldom, if ever, the first crimes of the unhappy wretches who commit them; but when once persons have entered upon evil courses, they commonly advance by hasty steps, till they become totally depraved and abandoned to all kinds of wickedness.

RULES and ORDERS

ESTABLISHED FOR THE BETTER GOVERNMENT OF THE

GAOL, of the Town of Kingston-upon-Hull, and County of the same Town, pursuant to the Statute 32d. Geo. II. Chap. 28th.

XXIII. All fines and forfeitures imposed by these rules and orders on debtors and others, except the felons, shall be kept in a box secured with two locks, and fixed in the debtors' day-room, for the sole purpose of purchasing such necessaries as may be agreed upon by a majority of the debtors, for the use of their day-room, and such instruments as they may think necessary for their reasonable amusement and exercise; the keys of the box to be kept by two persons to be appointed by such majority, and the forfeits of the felons to be laid out by the gaoler, in butchers meat for their use.

[Sheffield Prison.]

SHEFFIELD Prison for Debtors, is the property of the Duke of Norfolk. The court is enlarged, and the late tap room is a debtor's kitchen. In the two rooms of the common side debtors, the windows which were towards the street are properly stopt up. Though these are improvements, yet it is a bad prison, and much too small. No infirmary. For common side debtors of both sexes there are only two rooms, which are also their night-rooms. - Persons are sometimes confined here for so small a sum as sixpence and the fees. See the Act of the Court Baron 29th of Geo. II.

[Town Gaol.]

SHEFFIELD Town Gaol. Here is an addition of two small rooms under the town hall, which open into a narrow passage. This prison is on a plan by far too contracted for a populous and manufacturing town, so that the faulty apprentices are sent to the house of correction at Wakefield; where they are often ruined by associating with criminals. (See the notes under Birmingham and Leeds.)

1788, Aug. 5, Prisoner 1.

* The keeper told me that then there were near three hundred warrants, and often many more, but the prison is so small they could not be executed. Debtors are frequently brought here for the non-payment of their ale-house scores; for the occasion of the imprisonment of nine debtors out of ten in large manufacturing towns is drunkenness and idleness. I have often wished that in all bills for small debts there was a clause to prohibit arrest for debts contracted in public houses,

PONTEFRACT Town Gaol. The prison is under the town-hall. The passage to the two cells is called the room for debtors. No fire-place. The windows of the cells are towards the street. No court: no water. 1788, Jan. 10, No Prisoners.†

* In looking into the Cloth-hall in this town I was struck with the elegant neatness and plainness of the building, as affording many good hints for a penitentiary house: I therefore determined to give the elevation of part of this building in my plan. (See plate xx.). The area is 110 yards by 90: the building is quadrangular, containing 315 rooms; their size twelve feet and a half, by eight: the windows 3 feet wide: the staircases and passages are of done; the latter 6 feet wide to the iron balustrade, and also, very properly, 3 feet 5 inches high. The rules and orders are hung up on the staircases.

† At Ackworth, near Pontefract, there is a school belonging to the people called Quakers‖ in a healthy and fine situation. The house was built as an appendage to the foundling hospital, but was purchased (for about £7000) at the desire of that excellent man Dr. Fothergill, and intended for the education, maintenance and clothing of children of both sexes whose parents are not in affluence. They are instructed in reading, writing and accompts, and the girls in knitting, spinning, plain needle-work and domestic occupations. A small part of every day is devoted to silent and serious thoughtfulness, which does not seem tedious or irksome to the children, for they are habituated from their early infancy, at syated times, to silence and attention.

The house is a good and spacious building, and well adapted for the proper separation of the boys and girls. No children are admitted younger than nine years of age, except orphans, and but few remain in the house after they are fourteen. As the school is partly supported by donations and legacies, the expense to the parents is easy (about eight guineas a year for each child). The general average number of children is three hundred and ten. From the 18th of October 1779, to the end of 1787, nine hundred and ninety-two children have been admitted. Of these only twelve have died; three of them by the small-pox in 1782, in the natural way. Of thirty-two who were inoculated, none died.

At my visit, Jan. 10th, 1788, there were one hundred and sixty-two boys, and one hundred and eight girls, neat and clean, at their several employments, and the school-rooms were in great order. The children were calm and quiet, and their countenances indicated that this did not proceed from fear of the severity of their masters or mistresses. (I well remember an epression of the doctor's to me with reference to this school, "we have got a person at the head of it, who is made for the purpose.") Their bed-rooms were clean and in order: the children (properly) lie on hair mattresses, and in each room is an ufher or mistress. - I omit the diet table, because I do not approve of beer for children, nor of meat oftener than once or twice in a week.

‖ This much respected people, with whom I have passed many agreeable hours of my life, I trust will believe me when I say I cordially join in opinion with Dr. Percival, who in his Dissertations says, "The people improperly, because opprobriously, called Quakers, certainly merit a very high degree of esteem from their fellow citizens, on account of their industry, temperance, peaceableness, and catholic spirit of charity." To which I will add, as an amiable property, their uncommon neatness in their persons and houses.

County Hospital at York.

The four wards (two for each sex) were clean and quiet, and not in the least offensive. The bedsteads were iron, with wood laths; the furniture linen: the beds were hair on straw mattresses. Such beds are the most proper, as the hair when washed, dried and picked is as good as new, Patients at entrance are ungenerously obliged to advance 10s. each for washing their linen &c. but if they are soon discharged, part of the money is returned.

Allowance to felons (2d. per day) still paid only once a month. Their dungeon close and offensive; not white-washed. No court for felons, though the gaol delivery is only once a year.* Here a woman, committed for receiving a stolen handkerchief though lately brought to bed, was in heavy irons, which were taken off while I was there.

ALNWICK. At Alnwick Cattle there are the remains of an ancient prison. The entrance is through a narrow passage, sixteen feet long, to a room eleven feet four inches by ten feet four. At the centre, there is a descent by a ladder, through an aperture (two feet four inches, by one foot ten inches) into a dark and damp dungeon, about eight feet and a half square and eleven feet high. Such dungeons, and even much worse have I seen in old castles: it being the general mode of confinement in barbarous ages, when the security of prisoners was alone considered.

A new gaol is proposed to be built in the castle yard, where, I doubt not, there will be a proper

* At the summer assize in 1787, the felons of both sexes were, as usual, conveyed to and confined in the damp dungeon seven nights. I heard that the county hall was presented; but was not the presentment of this unhealthy dungeon equally necessary, where the water was running down the walls in August 1787?

On mentioning the abolition of the tap to Mr. Losh, the surgeon, he said, I am persuaded the prisoners would be healthier if they had proper nourishment, and only milk admitted into the gaol;* and they would be quieter; for when any liquor is brought them, they are riotous and quarrelsome, and plotting to break out.

* "One circumstance peculiarly worthy of notice, is the perfect and uninterrupted health of the inhabitants of New Zealand. In all the visits made to their towns, where old and young, men and women, crouded about our voyagers, they never observed a single person who appeared to have any bodily complaint; nor among the numbers that were seen naked, was once perceived the slightest eruption upon the skin, or the least mark which indicated that such an eruption had formerly existed. Another proof of the health of these people is the facility with which the wounds they at any time receive are healed. In the man who had been shot with a musquet-ball through the fleshy part of his arm, the wound seemed to be so well digested, and in so fair a way of being perfectly healed, that if Mr. Cook had not known that no application had been made to it, he declared that he should certainly have enquired, with a very interested curiosity, after the vulnerary herbs and surgical art of the country. An additional evidence of human nature's being untainted with disease in New Zealand, is the great number of old men with whom it abounds. Many of them, by the loss of their hair and teeth, appeared to be very ancient, and yet none of them were decrepid. Although they were not equal to the young in muscular strength, they did not come in the least behind them with regard to chearfulness and vivacity. Water, as far as our navigators could discover, is the universal and only liquor of the New Zealanders. It is greatly to be wished, that their happiness in this respect may never be destroyed by such a connexion with the European nations, as shall introduce that fondness for spirituous liquors which hath been so fatal to the Indians of North America."

See the Life of Captain Cook; by Dr. Kippis, Chap. II. p. 100. 1788.

† Here was a prisoner, lately the widow of an old gentleman, who left her an estate of £300 per annum and about £7000 in mortgages. She was afterwards married in Scotland to a Mr. Milbourne of this city, who soon spent £4000, but upon some disagreement she refused to give up the mortgages of the other £3000. By an attachment from the court of chancery, her husband sent her to the common gaol, which confinement prevented her compliance with an order for appearance at that court in fifteen days of St. Hilary's term next ensuing. At first she was on the master's side; but the late gaoler, after cruelly seizing her clothes &c. for chamber-rent, turned her to the common side. Her room (nine feet and a half by eight and a half) has no fire-place. She, not having the county allowance, supports herself by spinning and knitting, and the occasional kindness of her late husband's relations, while her present husband is living and rioting on her estate.

By a letter dated the 14th of October 1788, from a respectable gentleman at Carlisle, I am informed that Mrs. Milbourne is still in the gaol, and that for above two years, Mr. Milbourne did not give her one farthing, her subsistence being wholly on occasional charities, and the small earnings of spinning, at which employment she could not get more than 4d. but now by practice and extremely close application (when health permits) can earn 10d. a week. In March last her husband sent her twenty shillings, and in October 1788 (twenty-seven weeks after) the same sum. The justices last quarter sessions commiserating her hardships, have allowed her the county bounty; the first shilling of which, this modest poor woman received, the 11th of Oct. 1788.

It consists of four secure cells (eleven feet by nine feet two inches, and eight feet high) which are called the gaol: on the doors are curious locks which cannot be picked, made by an ingenious workman in that town. There are twelve rooms (thirteen feet by eleven, and eight feet high) on the two floors above, some of which are called the debtors' rooms, and four are occupied by the gaoler. None of the rooms were clean, though the house is new, and a fine stream of water is constantly running in the court. No allowance but their earnings.

COUNTY GAOL, LANCASTER CASTLE.

[Lancaster Castle.]

This prison was clean and quiet. Many of the convicts had only a single ring; and from a view of the prisoners in their rooms, and at chapel, I am persuaded the gaoler, Mr. Higgins, is humane and attentive.‡ Allowance to the debtors who are poor, two sixpenny loaves a week; to felons 11lb. of household bread a day, and a pennyworth of potatoes, butter, or cheese; and on Sunday, half a pound of good beef without bone, and a quart of broth, toals both to debtors and felons. The assize convicts have not the half crown a week. The good old surgeon, Mr. Wright, constantly refuses the debtors' application for spirituous liquors, as he well knows the quarrels, riot and confusion, such admission has frequently caused

* The late gaoler killed himself by drinking; and I find, in my visits, that many others have died by this vice; the taps in the gaols having been a very strong temptation to them.

† I found the work-house clean and quiet, as at my former visits. The cielings of all the rooms are too low, only seven feet high; the kitchen is improperly placed, and paved with pebbles, and there is no infirmary.

‡ In attending the service here on a Sunday, I observed some of the debtors much affected at this passage in one of the psalms which was read that day, O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee, Psal. lxxix, 12. which gave me the hint of taking it for a motto to my present publication.

in gaols.* - I was glad to find rules and orders hung up, and shall take the liberty to make a few observations on some of them, as several other counties may probably adopt the good regulations here enforced. - A very convenient house is built for the gaoler; and alterations are intended for the separation of prisoners, and solitary cells.† I have lately been informed that these improvements are now carrying on under the direction of Mr. Harrison, architect in Lancaster. Lord Loughborough, on the summer circuit 1787, very humanely interceded for the pardon of nine of the best behaved convicts, and I hear that their conduct since has shewn them worthy of the favour.

Debtors committed to this gaol in 1778, 109; 1779, 133; 1780, 126; 1781, 96; 1782, 121; 1783, 120; 1784, 97; 1785, 118; 1786, 127; 1787, 125. Total 1172.

In this county the law is more severe against debtors than in any other, owing to the court of common pleas that is held in it. The proceedings against debtors who are arrested by process from that court are ruled by the assizes, and not by the terms of the courts above; so that a debtor may stay in gaol twelve months before the plaintiff files his declaration: whereas a debtor in London, York &c. is declared against in two terms. If the plaintiff proceed, it is two years before he can take the benefit of the Acts of Parliament, though his debt be only £10. Gaoler's salary £.210 in lieu of the tap, fees, chamber rent &c. Several debtors came in at the close of a former year, in hopes of an insolvent act.

RULES, ORDERS, and REGULATIONS,

TO BE OBSERVED AND ENFORCED. FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE

COUNTY GAOL, IN THE CASTLE OF LANCASTER.

[Rules.]

I. No abuse, ill-treatment, quarrelling, or affray to be suffered amongst the prisoners; nor drunkenness, cursing, swearing, obscene or indecent language, nor gaining by dice, cards, or any other method whatsoever, on pain of being punished by closer confinement, fettering, and withholding their allowance;

* Dr. McFarlan, one of the ministers of Canongate, Edinburgh; in his Inquiries concerning the Poor; (1782.) says, that "the habit of drinking spirituous liquors to excess has become so frequent among the common people, that we can hardly walk the streets without seeing its shocking effects. There is no vice that has ruined a greater number of tradesmen, or brought more families to misery, than this. Its effects, in general, are such, that, before mid-day the unhappy victim is unqualified for business. Artificially exhilarated, he goes on, regardless of the consequences; and does not retire from the scene of dissipation, till both his money and credit are exhausted. In a very short time, the whole frame is debilitated, and he is rendered incapable of any continued labour. When this practice is confirmed by habit, they must have recourse to strong liquors to brace their trembling nerves; so that, even in the most abject state of poverty, every pittance they receive is expended in this manner. It is an object worthy of the attention of the legislature, and of every friend to mankind, to do what is possible to restrain so great an evil."

† It may be asked, of what size I would wish prisoners' solitary night-rooms to be? I answer, ten feet long, ten feet high, and eight feet wide; thus adopting a mean between the two extremes allowed by the act of parliament for penitentiary houses. (19th Geo. III.). Warming the rooms in any manner is unnecessary to those in health; but the sick must be provided for.

[Lancaster Rules.]

which punishments the gaoler is hereby authorized and required to inflict for the above offences, or other acts of disobedience to these rules and orders; but not to continue any of the above punishments for more than seven days, without a written order from one or more justice or justices of the peace for the county of Lancaster.

II. The gaoler shall provide and keep one or more books, in which he shall write down the name of every prisoner who shall in any wise behave ill, or be refractory and disobedient, specifying his offence, and the nature and term of his punishment; and he shall also insert the names of such prisoners who shall observe these rules, regularly attend public worship, and behave in a peaceable, orderly manner. And he shall regularly produce these books to the visiting justices, and at the assizes and quarter sessions.

III. The gaoler shall not, on any account or pretence whatsoever, demand or take from any prisoner in his custody, or any other person, any money or other matter, for fees, garnish money, chamber rents, &c. or for and at the entrance or discharge of any prisoner.

IV. The gaoler shall most strictly forbid and prohibit the demanding or taking any fees, garnish, or other money, by the prisoners, from one another, on any account or pretence whatsoever.

VII. The gaoler shall provide coals, soap, vinegar, blankets, straw, mops, sand, brushes, besoms, pails, washing bowls, towels, wiskets, and coal boxes, for the necessary use of the prisoners, so that their persons and all parts of the prison may be preferred (as much as is possible) in a state of cleanliness and health; and he shall deliver in an account of the same, and of the expences incurred, at each court of quarter sessions; who are hereby empowered to examine and allow the same, and to order the county treasurer to pay the amount to the gaoler.

VIII. Every person committed for felony, and every convict on being brought to the gaol, shall have all his own cloaths taken off, and be cleaned and washed, and be cloathed in the prison uniform; his own cloaths to be cleaned and stoved in an heated oven, ticketed and laid up, for the prisoner to put on again on his or her trial or discharge.

IX. No wives or children of any prisoner to be permitted to sleep in gaol, nor lodgers of any kind.

X. No pigs, fowls, or other animals must be kept within the walls of the prison, except the keeper's dogs, for his security.

XI. The gaoler shall ring the bell at the hour of locking up, which, during the months of November,

December, January, and February, shall be four o'clock, when the convicts, and those committed on charges of felony, shall be locked up in their day-rooms, in which shall be fires: and that during these months, the convicts shall be locked in their separate cells, or night-rooms, at seven o'clock, and the prisoners committed on charges of felony at eight o'clock. The gaoler shall also ring his bell on opening the wards and cells, which in the four winter months shall be at eight o'clock in the morning, and at sun-rising from the first of March to the first of October; or not later than six o'clock. The debtors to be locked up at nine o'clock during the whole year.

XII. The gaoler shall take especial care, that every day-room, night-room, and cell be swept clean by one or more prisoners in rotation, every day before breakfast, and washed every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

XIII. Every felon and bridewell prisoner shall have a daily allowance of one pound and a half of good and wholesome wheaten bread, one day old, and fairly weighed out by the prison scales, and also one pennyworth of cheese, butter, peas, potatoes, turnips, &c. according to the season; and the weekly allowance from the county to the poor debtors shall be given to them in bread, and not in money.

204 LANCASHIRE. Northern Circuit.

[Lancaster Rules.]

These allowances of provisions to be given out every morning to the prisoners, as soon as the rooms shall be made clean; but to be entirely withheld from all such as shall not have their hands and faces clean washed, and their persons clean and neat.

XIV. As an encouragement to industry, cleanliness, and good order, and a due attendance on religious worship, an extra allowance shall be made on every Sunday, of half a pound of coarse beef, and one quart of broth, (prepared with onions and turnips &c. in which it has been boiled) to every prisoner who shall have behaved well during the preceding week: but all allowances and indulgencies to be kept back from such prisoners who shall not duly attend divine service, according to the rules of the prison.

XV. No person whatsoever shall be permitted to bring ale or beer to the prisoners, (spirituous liquors are by law prohibited) except betwixt the hours of twelve and one at noon, and in the afternoon betwixt three and four in winter, and six and seven in summer; and no more than three pints a day to be allowed to each prisoner.

XVI. The gaoler shall keep a register, divided into regular columns, in which he shall write the following particulars of each prisoner committed to his charge, viz. name and place of abode; age; feature; complexion; colour of hair - by whom committed; for what offence; when, and how discharged; remarks on general behaviour, &c. to be returned at each assize and quarter session.

XVII. The sheriff of this county and his deputy, the justices at the quarter sessions, the grand jury at the assizes, and the visiting and other magistrates, are requested to inspect this gaol as frequently as possible, and to enquire how the above regulations are observed by the gaoler and his servants, and also by all the prisoners.

XVIII. The gaoler shall every day visit every part of the prison, except prevented by sickness or necessary absence, and also attend at divine service whenever the chaplain shall officiate.

XIX. The criminals, in rotation, shall every day pump up a full supply of the water for the use of the prison, as the gaoler shall appoint.

XX. The chaplain shall read prayers and preach a sermon every Sunday morning, and read prayers in the afternoon, and also read prayers every Wednesday and Friday, at eleven o'clock; and that the chaplain be empowered to purchase, at the expence of the county, Bibles and Common-prayer books, for the religious instruction of the poor prisoners, at his discretion.

XXI. The surgeon shall personally visit the felons, convicts, and poor debtors, whenever required; and once a week, or oftener, at other times.

XXII. These rules, orders, and regulations, together with a table of donations and legacies, and the three prohibitory clauses of the 24th Geo. II. chap. 40. shall be hung up, painted on a board or boards, in the most conspicuous part of the prison, and a sufficient number of them shall be printed for the use of the prisoners; and they shall be distinctly read over by the chaplain, on the first Sunday in every month after divine service.

Lancashire to wit. We whose names are hereunto subscribed, his majesty's justices of the peace, assembled in open sessions, January, 1786, approve of the above rules and orders, to be observed within the county gaol at Lancaster.

Observations on these Rules.

I. Instead of seven days, the gaoler's power to punish should, in my opinion, be limited to three days.

VIII. I was sorry to find that the magistrates had made no provision for the execution of this order.

X. By this good rule the keeper should have been limited as to the number of his dogs; for none should be permitted to have more than one or two.

XV. This seems too great an allowance, especially tb convicts.

XVII. I hope the magistrates will be very attentive to this good regulation.

XXI. Every regulation should be explicit. I have heard surgeons complain that they did not know who were included among those denominated poor debtors. In prisons where there are free wards, I should call those poor debtors who do not pay for a room or bed.

COUNTY BRIDEWELLS.

[Preston COunty Bridewell.]

PRESTON. Three of the rooms in this prison are made into a chapel. The court not being secure, the prisoners are never out. No bedding but a little straw. Employment, winding linen yarn and cotton, and spinning worsted. Prisoners have no allowance but their earnings;* here exceptions should be made, for some have suffered through sickness and want. About a year ago several were sick, but being properly attended, and relieved by charitable donations, and the glass being removed from all the windows of their cells, none died. - Here was a debtor from the court of requests, debt 7s. 8d. costs £1: 6: 10.

A new prison is nearly built on Mr. Blackburn's plan, in a fine situation, on a much larger scale, which will do honour to the county.

* By a careful inspection of the countenances of criminals in this and some other prisons, I am fully persuaded that the abolition of the tap is greatly conducive to their health. Their little money is now more generally spent in wholesome food, and they do not sell their bread allowance to buy liquors. In the northern counties of England milk is only halfpenny a quart, and oatmeal, which is much used by prisoners, is about 1½d. a pound. Ten ounces boiled in water, with a little salt and butter, make a good mess, which is here called water pottage; or if boiled with a little sugar and currants is called gruel. - Groats and water well boiled, and parboiled currants, will keep two or three days, and, when warmed and sweetened, I think will make a good medicine for the sick in prisons; and good vegetable soup is better than meat soup. If I might advise as to drink, tea is a wholesome and good liquor; and not only prisoners, but, as I have often found, sailors when sick, are very fond of it.

206 LANCASHIRE. Northern Circuit.

[Manchester Bridewell.]

MANCHESTER. No alteration. The women's side very clean. Employment, winding, spinning and picking cotton. The prisoners have their earnings, as there is no allowance except two-pence a day to the sick.

By the spirited exertions of Mr. Bayley, and other magistrates, a new prison is building on a large scale, from Mr. Blackburn's plan, in which there will be single cells, and separate apartments for faulty apprentices &c. This prison will reflect much credit on the good sense and liberality of the hundred of Salford, in this county, which alone defrays all the costs of the building.

LIVERPOOL BOROUGH GAOL.

No alteration in the old gaol. Allowance, to debtors, 3d. felons, 2d. and convicts, 4d. a day. Gaoler's salary augmented to £120 in lieu of the tap. The sick are supplied with medicines from the infirmary.

The corporation have spared no expense for the new gaol which Mr. Blackburn is employed in building: there will be a proper separation of the different classes and sexes; and with a view to security, health, reformation and convenience, I apprehend, it will be one of the first borough gaols in the kingdom.

1787, Dec. 22, Debtors 18. Felons &c. 22.

[Bridewell.]

LIVERPOOL Bridewell. No alteration. The keeper's apartments having no view into either of the courts, may be one reason that both sexes were locked up. All the men were in heavy irons, and seven out of eight women were chained to the floors, and in bed at noon on Sunday, having had no fire for several days.* The next day, two being thus chained, at my desire, they were released and set to picking oakum.†

* All the bedding was on the floors; for the bedsteads were laid in the upper rooms, because some of the prisoners had made a sort of ladder with them to get through the floor above, in order to facilitate an escape. But bedsteads and bedding are necessary for the health of prisoners; and escapes would be prevented by confinement in separate cells. In some of the cells solid stone or brick might be worked into the walls, about eighteen inches from the floor, and cased with oak planks raised at the head, on which the bedding might be laid, as I have seen in some foreign prisons.

† In Chester city gaol, Liverpool bridewell, and other prisons; I told the keepers that steady, lenient and persuasive methods with prisoners, are the best means to prevent them from breaking out; for their minds being uneasy, and their bodies harrassed, they are often driven to desperate attempts, which sometimes will be successful; and I mentioned the good effect of such measures at Oxford castle. Some of the keepers said, "they now find, they can do more with their prisoners by lenient measures, than with a rough hand."

Here are made, three good cells, eleven feet six inches by six feet two, and twelve feet high; and a large aperture in the under-ground passage. By an opposite aperture, the horrid stalls adjoining would be more freshened. The free ward for debtors is in the felons' yard. No infirmary. Allowance, 6lb. of good bread, but served only twice a week, and two pennyworth of potatoes. No allowance for coals. The convicts have not the half crown a week. I found here at both my visits, a prisoner, who had been reprieved, employed in the instruction of nine young prisoners, whom he had taught to read. Gaoler's salary £160 in lieu of the tap.

* Criminals of a certain description are entitled, by two acts of parliament, in his present Majesty's reign, to one half of the neat profits which they shall have earned, at the time of their discharge, and not before, These earnings I could wish to be given them at the end of every week, on the gross profits; which would take off all suspicion from their minds, as to the certainty of receiving them; and consequently, would afford greater encouragement to diligence. I would have them limited however by the magistrates (as is the case in many foreign houses of correction) with respect to the articles they should be allowed to purchase with their earnings, an account of which should be hung up in the prisons; such as milk, tea, coffee, cocoa, bread, butter, vegetables, meat &c.

† In the poor-house, which is finely situated near the bridewell, there were near a thousand inhabitants. In taking a cursory view, I could not but observe, the confusion and irregularity at dinner-time; the impropriety of having such numbers of the great boys and girls together, and at the top of the house; and the want of attention to a proper separation of the sexes in the tick-rooms.

Chester City Gaol.

No alteration. Prison not secure. The convicts, and prisoner for trial, were severely ironed, by the neck, hands, waist, feet, and chained to the floor; and at night to their beds in the horrid dungeon. Here was the first iron glove I have seen in England, which, though not yet used, shews the severity of the gaoler's disposition. Allowance, a pennyworth of bread to felons, and a pound to debtors; inferior in quality to that fold in the city. Debtors and felons are permitted to beg some hours in the day. That prisoners are not supplied with necessary food is a disgrace to such an opulent city. No proper separation of men and women either here, or in the county gaol. Gaoler's salary £50 in lieu of the tap.

Chester General Infirmary.

[Infirmary.]

The wards are spacious and clean, and the beds not crowded. The two fever wards were not in the least offensive: they were fitted up on the upper floor, on account of a contagious fever in Chester in 1784, and very properly were not cieled, but plastered to the tiles.* By the attention of the ingenious Dr. Haygarth, and his colleague, most of the patients then recovered. The good rules for these wards I here copy.

* Such upper rooms in most hospitals and work-houses, having joists laid across, and being cieled at the square, are generally low and bad apartments: so also the upper rooms in many houses are by this practice made close, unhealthy places; which, had they been cieled pretty near the ridge and had the sides coved, would have been more pleasing to the eye, and fresher to the inhabitants.

[Chester Infirmary Rules.]

Rules for the Fever Wards; to prevent the Infection of other Patients in the Chester Infirmary.

I. Fresh water and coals are to be brought up to the fever wards every morning; and other necessaries on ringing a bell.

II. No fever patients, nor their nurses, are suffered to go into other parts of the house. No other patient is allowed to visit the fever wards; nor any stranger, unless accompanied by the apothecary or his assistant.

III. Every patient, on admission, is to change his infectious for clean linen; the face and hands are to be washed clean with warm water, and the lower extremities fomented.

IV. All putrid discharges from the patients are to be taken out of the ward as soon as possible.

V. The floors of the wards are to be washed very clean twice a week, and near the beds every day.

VI. All foul linen is to be immediately thrown into cold water; and carefully washed twice out of clean water, in the adjoining room.

VII. Blankets, and other bed and body clothes are to be exposed to the open fresh air for some hours, before they are used by another patient.

VIII. All the bed clothes of the fever wards are to be marked Fever Ward, and all the knives, forks, pots, cups and other utensils are to be of a peculiar colour, lest they be inadvertently taken among other patients.

IX. All the windows of the fever wards are to be kept constantly open in the day, except the weather be very cold or wet; and some of them should not be shut in the night, if the patients be numerous, and the weather moderate.

X. No relation or other acquaintance can be suffered to take away any linen unwashed, nor other clothes till they have been long exposed to the fresh air.

* The Work-house at Nantwich was erected in 1779, on the common, and about eleven acres and a half of land enclosed, for which 2s. 6d. a year is paid to the lord of the manor. The house is visited weekly by the gentlemen of the town, in rotation. It was clean, and great attention seems to be paid to the inhabitants. The rooms are too low, and the upper parts of the windows too far from the cielings. Five shillings a month is allowed for tobacco and snuff, yet the use of tea, though purchased with their own money, is ordered to be punished by confinement in the dungeon. Aug. 1, 1788, there were eleven men, sixteen women, ten boys, seven girls.

I have found a regular weekly allowance also for tobacco and snuff in several other work-houses: but I own I cannot approve of thus encouraging the poor, and initiating the young in an idle custom, the

210 FLINTSHIRE. Chester Circuit.

COUNTY GAOL at FLINT.

[Flint County Gaol.]

A new gaol, built on a fine spot in the castle yard, similar to that at Ruthin. It is not kept clean, nor has it been white-washed since it was built; a fault too common in new gaols. The pump in the felons' court, as in many other gaols, out of order. Neither the clauses against spirituous liquors, nor the act for preserving the health of prisoners, hung up. Debtors have the county allowance. The costs being more than the debts, I copy the back of two of the warrants: debt 13s. 3d. costs 15s. 6d. - Debt £1: 19: 0, costs £2: 4: 0. Gaoler's salary now £45; and he has no chamber rent of the debtors.

filthy effects of which are more loathsome than can be well conceived, and very opposite to that spirit of cleanliness one would earnestly wish to inculcate. This indulgence is also creeping into gaols; and if I be not misinformed, the gaoler of this county makes a constant charge on that account, which is allowed. I suppose this practice in prisons and other crowded places has been favoured with a view of counteracting infection by means of the smoke; but where proper means are used for admission of fresh air, no fumigation is necessary; and where it is thought advantageous, much more effectual methods of applying the fume, as well as fumes of a more salutary nature, may easily be adopted. On the other hand, tea is rigorously prohibited in these houses, though, in my opinion, it is one of the most innocent luxuries, and when used with milk and sugar, is a wholesome as well as an agreeable beverage. And what can be a more proper encouragement to those who distinguish themselves by their cleanliness and industry, than rewarding them with an indulgence which renews one of the comforts, perhaps, of more prosperous days; and which is neither hurtful to themselves, nor offensive to others? - I could wish that all old and infirm people, in all parish work-houses, had one third of their earnings, as is the case at Hamburg &c. which I am persuaded would even be for the advantage of such parishes.

Before I conclude this subject of work-houses, I must add, that I by no means approve of the idea of parishes giving no relief to persons out of their work-houses; for, even the best establishments of this kind have something in them repugnant to the feelings of an Englishmen. An ingenious writer has proposed parish work-shops (similar to what I have mentioned at Vienna): and was not Mr. Henry Fielding's proposal of the same nature? "that poor people might relieve themselves; and by repairing to them in the day-time, and receiving what they earned, they would be enabled to return to the comforts of their own fire side, and be it liberty to engage in any other occupation that might offer." "For the original institution of the poor laws is, in Judge Blackstone's words, to relieve the impotent poor, and them only; and to find employment for such as are able to work: a plan more humane and beneficial than even feeding and clothing of millions, by affording them the means (with proper industry) to feed and clothe themselves."

If all parishes were to procure the means of labour, both for men and women, I am persuaded it would keep many out of those places of confinement, parish work-houses: and as for such persons as have nothing but their labour by which to support themselves, they should be compelled to work, in well regulated houses of correction, unless in cases of sickness, age and incapacity.

* Dr. Hedges, who was in great practice in London, during the plague in 1665, and wrote an Historical Account of it, says, "Whether we regard the narcotick quality of this American henbane; Or the poisonous oil which exhales from it in smoking; or that prodigious discharge of spittle which it occasions, and which nature wants for many other important occasions; or, lastly, the exercise it gives to the lungs in drawing it; besides the aptitude of the pestilential poison to be taken down along with it, and the irksomeness of its scent; I must confess myself at uncertainties about it: though, as to myself, I am its professed enemy." And to the advocates for such a habit, who use the argument of its being antipestilential, I would only ask; in what country is smoking more used than in Turkey?

Two rooms and a chapel are built over the brew-house; but there is only one court; and no proper separation of men and women prisoners. Allowance, three pennyworth of brown bread from the gaoler: 2lb. 2½oz the weight of the assize which the magistrates had sent to the gaol. - Several debtors, confined on county court warrants, were released about two months ago by a lady. One, whose debt was 13s. the costs 19s. 5d. Another, debt 30s. costs 17s. 5d. Another, debt £2: 1: 0. costs £1: 19: 10. Another, debt 10s. 6d. costs £1: 12: 3. besides the sheriff's fee for each, and the gaoler's fee 3s. 6d. Gaoler's salary £12: 12: 0 from the sheriff, and £35 from the county, in lieu of the tap. - I here give a pertinent observation of Mr. Powell, the worthy chaplain of this gaol. "Among the many good effects of the abolition of the tap in gaols, one struck me most forcibly, which is this: before that salutary measure took place, on an execution day, while I was labouring to prepare the unhappy criminals for that awful change they were soon to undergo, my ears were shocked with the most horrid oaths, blasphemies, noise and confusion, occasioned by numbers of people who came out of curiosity to the gaol that day, many of whom were in a state of intoxication. - Since that regulation, all is decency and order. The unfortunate convict and myself do not experience the least disturbance at that solemn time, when they are about to launch into eternity."

In 1782, I had the pleasure to find a new gaol built on the castle hill, instead (as the Flint gentlemen have said of their old gaol) "of the ancient, loathsome place of confinement." The prison clean and quiet: yet, I am sorry to add, no divine service had been performed in the chapel for some time past. I must here make a general remark, that neither the act for preserving the health of prisoners, nor the three clauses against the admission of spirituous liquors into gaols, are hung up in any of the prisons of this country.

SWANSEY Town Gaol. The debtors' room is very close, and has only one window, which is partly stopt by a shed built against the wall.

In 1787 there were two men and two women confined in it from Monday till Friday. Similar to this is the prison at Neath where one of the quarter sessions is held.*

1788, May 22, Debtor 1.

In my various journies in England and Wales, I have seen many houses defaced on account of the odious tax on windows; and I cannot help repeating my concern for its pernicious effects. I am persuaded it has a very bad influence on the health of the lower classes of people; and this may be one reason of their not having now such healthy, ruddy complexions as they had formerly. The farmers' servants having been crowded into unventilated rooms or holes, and our labouring poor having been habituated to close habitations, they dislike, when they come into work-houses or hospitals, the admission of fresh air.

* Before I quit this subject, I would just mention, that in all my visits to the gaols and prisons, in this, and other kingdoms, I never received any insults either from keepers or prisoners; nor have I lost any thing in any of them, except, that in one of our prisons I once lost a large new handkerchief out of my pocket, which I did not miss for some time, but on a subsequent visit, about ten months after, it was immediately presented to me by a prisoner; as, he said, he believed I had dropped it when I was there last.

216 HULKS.

The HULKS on the THAMES.

[Thames Hulks.]

Plymouth Hulk.

At both my visits, the hulks were clean, the bread good, the prisoners healthy, and many were at work. The hospital ship was cleaner and quieter than most of our county hospitals. Several convicts were lately come from the county gaols, and the captain justly observed, how different the health and complexion of such prisoners are now, from what they were when I first visited the hulks. - But I must repeat my complaint, that such an assemblage is entirely destructive to the morals of young convicts: the profaneness of the prisoners is not properly checked; and some of the guards set them a example.

March 26th, 1787, the number of convicts was 549, of whom the Justitia had 246, the Censor 229, and the Ceres 74. Of these thirty-six were in the hospital ship, eleven from the Justitia, twelve from the Censor, and thirteen from the Ceres.

July 16th, 1788, the number was 741. The Justitia had two hundred and sixty-five, the Censor two hundred and forty-eight, and the Stanislaus two hundred and twenty-eight.

From the Justitia ninety, and from the Stanislaus one hundred and thirty-two, were at work on the shore, and in the ballast lighters.

In the hospital ship were 32; from the Justitia twelve, from the Censor twelve, and from the Stanislaus eight.

The HULK at PLYMOUTH.

[Plymouth Hulk.]

November 10th, 1787, the convicts at Plymouth dock were on board the hulk of the Chatham, a seventy gun ship, and were healthy and well; but the Dunkirk, which is more commodious, was repairing for them. Their bread, beef and beer were good; but the bread allowance of 4lb a day to six men, is not sufficient. There were among them many fine young fellows, who all lived in total idleness, though some useful employment might here easily be found. There were ninety-two men and one woman: nine more convicts were coming on board from the gaol at Glamorgan.

June 28th, 1788, there were three hundred and sixty-six convicts in the Dunkirk, which was fitted up with several separate rooms. In one of the rooms, fifty-seven feet by eighteen, and six feet high, there were sixty-eight. Such a room, at night, when the hatches are down, must be very offensive. At one end, there is a room called the infirmary, and a recovery ward; in the former were seven convicts, and in the latter thirteen. The meat was sweet, but the bread not good, and the beer thick.

The prisoners were all in total idleness, except six or seven who were making a boat for the captain. One ingenious man had made a small ink-stand (which I have by me) out of a bone of his meat; but his knife was taken from him. I saw some with bibles in their hands; but here is no chaplain, nor any religious service. Here also some of the keepers, by their profaneness, set a bad example to the prisoners.

HULKS. 217

[Plymouth Hulk.]

Three miserable objects, for attempting to break out, were let down into a dreadful, dark and deep hole at the bottom of the ship, where they lay, almost naked, upon a little straw; but, having been thus confined for some weeks, upon their earned entreaties, I obtained their release.

The HULK at GOSPORT.

[Gosport Hulk.]

At Gosport, July 7th, 1788, there were two hundred and seventy-three convicts in the bulk of an old Indiaman, called the Lion, which was moored here May 1st, 1788. The ship was clean, and the prisoners had a healthy and placid look; but they lay two on a bed, with one blanket. Here were several to be transported for life, and some whole sentences were for a short term: among them were boys of only ten years of age. About one hundred and fifty of them were on shore, moving mould, who had irons on both legs, and a chain between them. Five carpenters were fitting up rooms for them to dine in, on shore; which is much better than returning at noon to the hulk, as the convicts do on the Thames.

The HULKS near PORTSMOUTH.

[Portsmouth Hulks.]

At Langston harbour, near Portsmouth, are three hulks. In La Fortunée (formerly a French thirty-six gun frigate) there were, July 8th, 1788, three hundred and thirty-eight convicts. In the Ceres, which was the receiving ship at Woolwich, and was brought round here July 1st, 1788, were two hundred and nineteen convicts. The other is an old hulk, now fitting up for an hospital ship. Two hundred and thirty of the convicts of the Fortunée, and one hundred and four of the Ceres, were at work on

Cumberland Fort; nineteen of them as masons, six as carpenters, and the rest as labourers. Most of these were unloading the ships, and carrying stones to different parts of the new works. They dine on shore at twelve o'clock. Their bread and beer were good, but they complained sadly of the meat, and indeed not without cause; for the beef was very lean, full of bones, and not half the allowance, viz. one pound to each man before it is dressed. The diet table which I had formerly seen in the cabin of the Justitia I here copy.

[Diet Table.]

A Table of Diet expended by the Convicts on board the Justicia Hulk daily.

Each mess is for six men, with seven pounds of bread every day.

Breakfast. Every day; a pint of barley or rice, made into three quarts of soup.

Dinner. Sunday, Six pounds of salt pork or seven pounds of beef, with five quarts of beer.

- Monday, Wednesday, Friday, six pounds of bullock's head.

- Thursday, Thursday, Saturday, two pounds of cheese, and five quarts of beer.

Supper. Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, a pint of pease and barley, made into three quarts of soup.

- Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, a pint of oatmeal, made into burgou.

218 HULKS.

[Portsmouth Hulks.]

All who are employed in the public works on shore have, each day they work, one pint of small beer, the king's allowance. Most of them had a ring on one leg, and the other ring fastened to their waistband.

Both the ships were clean, particularly the Ceres. The Fortunée had few sick in that part called the hospital; but the Ceres had many more sick than the hospital part could contain.† Several had the gaol-fever, and a few, petechiae. - Six out of ten that went from Bedford were dead, and two of the others were very sickly and dispirited.‡ - The convicts lie two on a straw bed, with one blanket; and after one is taken ill, his companion soon sickens. Some few have hammocks, which in every view are better, and I wish they were in general use, except in the hospital ships. The Ceres being an old receiving ship, may be one cause of its being contaminated with infection; and most of the convicts here are from the country. There is not however, in general, that attention to cleanliness in the clothes, linen, and persons of the prisoners in the hulks which is necessary to preserve their health: for though some were decently clothed in their own clothes, others were in rags; many without shirts. All should be clothed in a sailor's uniform, of jacket, trowsers &c. and I could wish that the whole of Saturday were appropriated to cleanliness, viz. bathing, washing and mending their clothes, shaving, cleaning themselves and every part of the ships, and beating and airing their bedding. Thus endeavouring to introduce habits of cleanliness is an object of great importance; as many officers have observed, "that the most cleanly men are always the most decent and honest, and the most slovenly and dirty are the most vicious and irregular." On other days, none who are able should be excused from work. There were in the Fortunée one hundred excused from work, though the ship was healthy.

It would be better if there were a diet table painted and hung up in every hulk, for the inspection of the convicts; and if they were permitted to choose two of their number to see that justice is done to them, as in the ninth article of the rules for the prisoners of war, which I formerly published; and proper scales, weights and measures ought to be kept for their use. There should also be a table of rules and orders, similar to that for

* It is asserted by some persons, and government are made to believe it, that these convicts do more work than common day-labourers. But, from the frequent observation of them, I am convinced the contrary is the truth; and indeed, how could it be expected that men who labour involuntarily, with scanty diet, and small encouragement, should exert themselves with as much spirit as those who have the pleasing idea of a wife and children to share in their gains?

† At my visit to the Hospital of the galley slaves at Naples, which is on the shore fronting the bay, on my telling the surgeon, that in some countries a part of each galley is made an hospital (alluding in my mind to our hulks); he replied, "that must soon make the whole an hospital."

‡ The gaoler at Reading told me, July 12th, 1788, that of the eleven convicts whom he carried on board the hulks, April ill, 1787, all were dead but three. I have observed, that convicts from the country often pine away and die without any apparent sign of illness; and that of equal numbers, from the country, and from Newgate, three or four of the former die for one of the latter.

HULKS. 219

[Portsmouth Hulks.]

prisoners of war, with a strict prohibition against which, I am sorry to say, is particularly necessary for the guards of these convicts. A gentleman of reputation should be appointed as commissary, to whom the prisoners, in case of cruelty or injustice, might immediately appeal; and who also should aee that the money allowed by government, at the end of their term, be given them. See Act 16th Geo. III. 43. and Act 24th Geo. III. cap. 12. sect. 6. By this act, and another of the same year cap. 56. sect. 9. it is declared, "That all the time during which any offender, shall have continued in gaol under sentence of transportation, or being removed under the provisions aforesaid, shall continue confined by virtue of this act, shall be taken and reckoned in discharge, or part discharge, or satisfaction of the term of his transportation." Some of the convicts were sentenced for life, others for fourteen, seven, five, or three years: among these were boys; and all associating together without distinction. Is it not contrary to justice and humanity to send convicts who are not sentenced for life, to a settlement so remote that there is no probability of their return; and a still greater hardship to those who are sent after they have been four or five years and upwards in confinement, as some were in the last fleet to Botany Bay?

I think it will be admitted that the mode of confinement and labour in the hulks is too severe for the far greater number of those who are confined in them. At the same time, there is no proportion of punishment to the several offences, and consequently, no distinction of guilt; which many wise legislators have long lamented as an evil which wants to be remedied.

* The great mortality that has happened among the convicts from the time they were first put on board the Justicia hulk at Woolwich, in August 1776, does not, I am persuaded, proceed from their being confined on the water; (though in many other views I dislike this mode of confinement): as, from the general practice of foreigners in building their prisons, hospitals and poor-houses, near the wafer, it seems, that they have no apprehension of bad consequences arising from such a situation. Dr. Heberden has expressed his sentiments on this subject in the Medical Transactions, pages 521, 524. "In England few make any doubt of the great danger attending wet rooms. - Is this opinion founded upon experience, or is it a prejudice, which has been suffered to grow up, and get strength, merely for want of being examined? If we inquire into the arguments in favour of this notion, we shall hardly find any other, than the random conjectures of the sick about the cause of their illness; or than their artfully substituting this origin of it instead of some other, which they are unwilling to own. - The air from rivers and from the sea is probably more replenished with vapors, than inland countries cleared of their woods; yet the most celebrated of ancient physicians recommended the bank of a running river for the situation of a house, on account of its peculiar healthiness; and many invalids are sent by the modern physicians to the sea side, only for the benefit of the sea air."

REMARKS

PENITENTIARY HOUSES.

[Remarks on Penitentiary Houses.]

THE Act for establishing Penitentiary Houses, drawn up by two of the wisest men this kingdom has produced, was "a work of long and continued labour and inquiry," and the legislature fully expressed their wise and humane sentiments in the following terms; "that if many offenders convicted of crimes for which transportation has been usually inflicted, were ordered to solitary imprisonment, accompanied by well regulated labour, and religious instruction, it might be the means, under Providence, not only of deterring others from the commission of the like crimes, but also of reforming the individuals, and of inuring them to habits of industry."* Such a great and comprehensive plan will

* As I have formerly published, in a table, the number of criminals delivered from Newgate to be transported, in the years 1773, 1774, 1775; I shall here take liberty of copying, at the end of this work, from the appendix to the draught of a bill for erecting Penitentiary Houses, the lists in the House of Commons, of "all persons, who between the first day of November 1769, and the first day of November 1776, had, within any jurisdiction of England and Wales, been ordered for transportation, in consequence of conditional pardons or otherwise: which lists, were returned to the house pursuant to a motion for that purpose of the 8th of November 1776." Upon these lists the following observation is added, "The annual average of persons sentenced to transportation during the seven years above specified, appears to have been nine hundred and sixty; and this number is less by near one half than would probably be found in similar lists for the seven years preceding: for the judges had already seen strong objections to transportation, and had discouraged the use of it, as far as was compatible with the public convenience and safety." I perfectly concur in opinion, with a great and learned writer, whom I have already quoted, "that every effect of banishment, as practised in England, is often beneficial to the criminal, and always injurious to the community."

PENITENTIARY HOUSES. 221

[Remarks on Penitentiary Houses.]

necessarily require alterations and amendments; but I well remember the good Judge Blackstone saying to me, "Let it get into the House, and a beginning be made."

I will therefore take the liberty to suggest, that there are some things in the act which it may be proper to alter. The time for which some of the convicts are to be committed to the intended Penitentiary houses, viz. some one year, some two years. Such criminals seem more proper for the county houses of correction: for is it possible to think of any reformation in a convict's behaviour, that is likely to prove lasting, in the compass of a year? I could wish to have all such as are not to remain in a Penitentiary house five years, at least, disposed of in some other manner.

The term Penitentiary clearly shews that parliament had chiefly in view the reformation and amendment of those to be committed to such places of confinement.

To these houses, however, I should wish that none but old, hardened offenders, and those who have, as the laws now stand, forfeited their lives by robbery, house-breaking, and similar crimes, should be committed; or in short, those criminals who are to be confined for a long term, or for life. I wish that no persons might suffer capitally but for murder - for setting houses on fire - and for house-breaking, attended with acts of cruelty. Our present laws are certainly too sanguinary, and are therefore ill executed; which last circumstance, by encouraging offenders to hope that they may escape punishment, even after conviction, greatly tends to increase the number of crimes. Yet many are brought to a premature end, who might have been made useful to the state. Indeed, I the more earnestly embarked in the scheme of erecting Penitentiary houses, from seeing cart loads of our fellow creatures carried to execution, "though the generous nature of our countrymen rarely permits them to perpetrate acts of cruelty," when at the same time I was fully persuaded that many of those unhappy wretches, by regular, steady discipline in a Penitentiary house, would have been rendered useful members of society; and above all, from the pleasing hope, that such a plan might be the means of promoting the salvation of some individuals; of which, every instance is, according to the unerring word of truth, a more important object, than the gaining of the whole world.

The Penitentiary houses I would have built, in a great measure, by the convicts. I will suppose that a power is obtained from parliament to employ such of them as are now at work on the Thames, or some of those who are in the county gaols, under sentence of transportation, as may be thought most expedient. - In the first place, let the surrounding wall, intended for full security against escapes, be completed, and proper lodges for the gate-keepers. - Let temporary buildings, of the nature of barracks, be erected in some part of this enclosure which will be wanted the least, till the whole is finished. Let one or two hundred men, with their proper keepers, and under the directions of the builder, be employed in levelling the ground, digging out the foundation, serving the masons, sawing the timber and stone: and as I have found several convicts who were carpenters, masons, and smiths, these may be employed in their own branches of trade} since such work is as necessary and proper as any other in which they can

222 PENITENTIARY HOUSES.

[Remarks on Penitentiary Houses.]

be engaged. Let the people thus employed chiefly consist of those - whole term is nearly expired - or, who are committed for a short term; and as the ground is suitably prepared for the builders, the garden made, the wells dug, and the building finished, let those who are to be dismissed go off gradually; as it would be very improper to send them back to the hulks or gaols again. By this method, they may be kept most usefully employed; and at the same time, by regular labour, some degree of separation, and proper conduit of their overseers to them, they may perhaps be a little reformed: for, except their keepers, and the directors of the works, they will be no more intermixed with other people than where they are now, at Woolwich, Portsmouth, or Gosport.* - I have not considered this scheme superficially, though I can bear being told, it is absurd. Many have been reclaimed and made useful members of society, in foreign houses of correction, and have thanked God for their confinement in them: these houses are called in Holland Verbeter huizen, that is, bettering houses: and the settled object in all such houses should be, to make men better; at least, more useful subjects. Their earnings constitute, in my opinion, but a secondary consideration: for surely, it is impossible to place any degree of profit in competition with the prospect of meliorating the minds of our fellow creatures.

The object I am sensible is great, but it is useful. If I should not be able to accomplish this good work, I would still endeavour to bring materials, and lay the foundation; that others, of more skill, may afterwards undertake the benevolent task, and carry to perfection a plan, worthy of the great Sir William Blackstone, with whom I had the honour of much conversation on this subject; a man, of such vast extent of capacity, as to have comprehended, in one enlarged view, the whole fabric of our laws; who was able to reduce them to a regular system; and, who further possessed, what is rarely united to great abilities, constancy to execute his immortal work.

This great and good man Dr. Fothergill saw just before he died, to whom he then turned, and asked "what progress we had made in the Penitentiary houses." The doctor answered, that we had paid all possible attention to the sentiments of others respecting a situation, that we must soon be obliged to request the opinion of our judges concerning it, and till this was obtained, we could not proceed much farther. - BE FIRM IN YOUR OWN, was all that he was able to say, as he soon after departed to a better life.

* From greater experience, and longer observation, I am more confirmed in a remark that I formerly made on the notion, that convicts are ungovernable, which is certainly erroneous. There is a mode of managing some of the most desperate, with ease to yourself, and advantage to them. Many such are shrewd and sensible. Let them be managed with calmness, yet with steadiness: shew them that you have humanity, and that you aim to make them useful members of society: and let them see and hear the rules and orders of the prison, that they may be convinced they are not defrauded in their provisions or clothes, by contractors or gaolers. When they are sick, let them be treated with tenderness. Such conduct would prevent mutiny in prisons, and attempts to escape; which I am fully persuaded are often owing to prisoners being made desperate, by the profaneness, inhumanity and ill usage of their keepers.

PENITENTIARY HOUSES. 223

[Remarks on Penitentiary Houses.]

This account of the Judge's last conversation I received, in a letter from the doctor, in January 1780; as I was then attending the press at Warrington. I shall take the liberty to copy verbatim my immediate answer to that letter.

Mr. Justice Blackstone's dying words, Be firm in your own opinion, seem to me the most important direction for our conduct. We are fixed upon as the proper persons to determine upon a plan, situation &c. of a Penitentiary house. Why then transfer the office to other persons, whose station of life, and other engagements must render them very unfit for entering into such a matter? Let us, when we meet, absolutely fix upon one situation, as the best on the whole, according to our ideas; and specifying our reasons, let us submit the approbation or rejection of this one plan, to those in whom the law has vested such a power; but not give them the unnecessary trouble, or us the improper degradation, of determining, in our Head, the respective advantages of several different plans. I am sensible that many amendments will occur in the execution of every part of this plan; but these must be the result of experience, as we go on. At any rate, we are the proper judges of that part which the law has committed to us, and ought to follow our own ideas with firmness without depending upon the superior judgment of others.

On my return from Lancashire, the doctor and I fixed on a spot at Islington, our colleague, Mr. Whatley, preferring one at Limehouse.

I shall now give the reasons why Dr. Fothergill and myself fixed on two enclosures at Islington, as proper sites for the Penitentiary houses, for male and female convicts; as it may afford some hints, should such a plan, in future, be adopted.

This situation possesses the following advantages, some of which are expressly pointed out in the act for erecting these houses.

I. The situation is healthy.

II. Water is to be had on the premises; of which large supplies may be obtained from the White Conduit, the property of the Charter-house, but now unnecessary to them; as they are more conveniently supplied by the New River Company.

III. Should both these sources fail, or prove insufficient, any requisite quantity of water may be had from the New River Company.

IV. It is remote from any houses; and so much ground may be purchased, as to prevent other buildings from being erected in its neighbourhood: circumstances particularly adverted to in the act providing for these establishments. We apprehended the benefit to be derived from these houses would, in a great degree, depend upon the constant attention of the persons appointed to the government of the institution, the first of its kind in the nation, and designed as a model for others in different parts of the kingdom: and as we thought the intention of the act was, by solitary confinement, well regulated labour, and religious instruction, to reform, as well as to punish for past offences, and

224 PENITENTIARY HOUSES.

[Remarks on Penitentiary Houses.]

were convinced that these great ends cannot be so easily effected at a distance from London, as in its neighbourhood, on account of the difficulty of prevailing upon proper persons to undertake the charge of the institution; we were induced by these confederations, from a sense of duty to the present and to future ages, to fix upon a place as near the centre of the metropolis as is consistent with the just and salutary views of the legislature. - Among other alterations and amendments which seem very desirable in the present act; I could wish the judges, and their successors, to be constituted perpetual guardians of the Penitentiary houses. In this case, vicinity to the Metropolis will be essential to a proper situation for them; and, were there no other advantage to recommend it, I think a proper inspection so absolutely necessary to the good government of Penitentiary houses, that neither expense, nor a few other conveniences, ought to be set in competition with so important a circumstance.

V. Dr. Fothergill and I apprehended, there would be a considerable advantage at Islington in the ready supply of suitable provisions, such as the coarser parts of shambles meat; which, even from the finest animals, may be purchased at a cheaper rate than other pieces; but which can scarcely be collected, in sufficient quantity, except from the markets of the metropolis.

VI. It would be difficult to employ the convicts in raising large quantities of garden productions with security: they must also in this case, have frequent, and unavoidable intercourse with other people; and, so near to London, employing them in this manner would be attended with loss; as all kinds of garden produce may be bought there much cheaper than it can be raised, by forced labour.

VII. Except the houses were erected on the side of the Thames (where we could not find a spacious and proper spot in the vicinity of London or Westminster) or on a navigable canal, both food, and the heavy materials on which the convicts are to be employed, would be brought cheaper to Islington, than to any other place so near the centre of the metropolis.

VIII. Should the convicts ever form a desperate design of effecting their escape, assistance to quell any such attempt might be much more easily procured at Islington, than at any more distant place. The assistants at Clerkenwell, at Newgate and the Compter, as well as the soldiers quartered in the neighbourhood, might soon be convened, and in sufficient numbers, for this purpose.* And, indeed, the certainty of such assistance being at hand, might discourage any such conspiracies: whereas, if the houses were remote, and but slenderly guarded, the officers of them might sometimes fall a sacrifice to the desperate rashness of the convicts.

* My studious friend, Mr. Lofft, joins with Dr. Jebb in controverting my idea upon this point: one telling me "that in no particular or possible circumstance the interference of the established army should be admitted." The other: "that the objections against employing the military are numerous, obvious, weighty, and irresistibly conclusive."

PENITENTIARY HOUSES. 225

[Remarks on Penitentiary Houses.]

IX. No small difficulty and expense to the counties are at present incurred in sending their convicts to Woolwich and Plymouth, by reason of their distance from London: for when the convicts come at night to town, they are to be lodged, and securely guarded at a considerable expense, till they are admitted to the hulks. This difficulty and expense would be prevented by their immediate admission at Islington.

X. I allege, that the expense of building is less, in the neighbourhood of London, than at a distance from it. Perhaps it may be said that land will be cheaper in proportion farther from the capital. To this I only reply, that the spot at Islington would probably have come cheaper, at the time it was proposed, than an equal extent in any other part, about London: but that, for a building which is intended for public utility, and which is to endure for ages, the difference in the price of land, between one situation and another, is, in my view, a consideration of no weight. - A Penitentiary house for male convicts, erected at Islington, would have this further advantage, that it would be seen by multitudes; yet, be so placed and defended, that no communication could be had with the convicts. Some of them might be seen at labour; or correction, if necessary; and so exhibit an instructive lesson to others, who might be treading in the same paths that brought them to such a state of confinement and punishment.

The Penitentiary house for female convicts, and its inhabitants, the doctor and I intended to be totally secluded from the observation of any, by the structure of the building. But the same advantages with respect to healthiness,* water, inspection, provisions, fuel, and materials for labour, would also be found in it. However, I acknowledge it has always appeared to me, that some little difficulty will arise in regard to the proper management of a house of this kind. If men are to be employed in it, great care must be taken who are trusted in such a place. If women, which I should prefer upon the whole, it will not be easy to find such as have prudence enough to govern without either tyranny on the one hand, or too much imbecillity and relaxation of discipline on the other. Yet, probably it will be a greater difficulty to find men, though of as steady principles as most we can expect to meet with, who will keep clear, as they ought to do, of all partialities. This I know from my observations in gaols. But

* In respect to healthiness, the situation at Islington is much more eligible than any of the populous parts of the city - so that by providing airy apartments, free ventilation, plenty of water; and by promoting cleanliness, accompanied with wholesome food, and a proper degree of labour; the convicts may there enjoy better health than falls to the lot of many thousands of reputable tradesmen and mechanics: and at the same time, these Penitentiary houses would not be so near any other buildings as to facilitate escapes, of prove an annoyance to the neighbourhood. - I will only add, that when I was supervisor, I listened with eagerness and impartiality to every situation that was proposed, visited the places, and attended to the various opinions that were suggested to me on the subject: nevertheless, upon the most mature deliberation, I am still of the same opinion, that taking all things together, Islington is the most proper, and best spot, on which to build the Penitentiary houses.

226 PENITENTIARY HOUSES.

[Remarks on Penitentiary Houses.]

perhaps among a greater number of prisoners, as in Penitentiary houses, the danger would be less.*

A proper plan for the government of Penitentiary houses is of great importance, and is more practicable than some suspect. I am aware indeed of the difficulty of accomplishing so arduous an undertaking as that of reforming criminals, and inuring them to habits of industry; yet, when it is for the public good, we ought to make experiments; and indeed, what have I been doing in collecting the regulations of some of the best directed houses of correction in Europe, and such as experience has proved to be practicable, but endeavouring to facilitate the execution of this useful design? The decency, regularity, and order, that I observed in the houses of correction in Holland, Hamburg, Bern, Ghent, Florence &c. I am fully persuaded, proceeded, in a great degree, from the constant attention that is paid to impress the prisoners with a sense of religion, by plain, serious discourse, catechising and familiar instruction from the chaplains, together with the influence of a good example, both in them and the keepers. These circumstances make a much greater impression upon the minds of criminals, when in prison, than they would have done before they came there. We have too much adopted the gothic mode of correction, viz. by rigorous severity, which often hardens the heart; while many foreigners pursue the more rational plan of softening the mind in order to its amendment.

I hope I shall be excused in repeating some general hints on this subject, as an outline for the government of such houses.

* Many friendly hours have I spent with Dr. Fothergill, and several of these observations are taken from hints which he suggested. Indeed, our sentiments on this subject so exactly coincided, that I absolutely refused acting as a supervisor of the Penitentiary houses, unless Dr. Fothergill were joined with me in the office; which his Majesty graciously condescended to grant. But, the constant opposition we met with from some of those whom the act appointed judges of the situation, plans &c. would, I am persuaded, have induced the doctor, had he lived, as well as myself, to have resigned the supervisorship of those houses. I here take the liberty of introducing my letter of resignation, addressed to Earl Bathurst, Lord President of the Privy Council, in January 1781, soon after Dr. Fothergill's death.

MY LORD,

When Sir William Blackstone prevailed upon me to act as a supervisor of the buildings intended for the confinement of certain criminals, I was persuaded to think that my observations upon similar institutions in foreign countries would, in some degree, qualify me to assist in the execution of the statute of the 19th year of his present Majesty. With this hope, and the prospect of being associated with my late worthy friend Dr. Fothergill, whose wishes and ideas upon the subject I knew corresponded entirely with my own, I cheerfully accepted his Majesty's appointment, and have since earnestly endeavoured to answer the purpose of it; but, at the end of two years, I have the mortification to see that not even a preliminary has been settled. The situation of the intended buildings has been made a matter of obstinate contention, and is at this moment undecided. Judging therefore from what is past, that the further sacrifice of my time is not likely to contribute to the success of the plan, and being now deprived, by the death of Dr. Fothergill, of the assistance of an able colleague, I beg leave to signify to your Lordship my determination to decline all further concern in the business; and to desire that your Lordship will be so good as to lay before the King my humble request, that his Majesty will be graciously pleased to accept my resignation, and to appoint some other gentleman to the office of a supervisor in my place. I have the honour to be

With great respect &c. J.H.

After thus seeing these Tables together, I presume magistrates will not be forward to assert that I am an advocate for luxury in prisons. But it may be said, prisoners of war are not felons, nor yet debtors; I grant there is a material difference in the circumstances of foreign and domestic prisoners; but there is none in their nature. Debtors and felons, as well as hostile foreigners, are men; and by men they ought to be treated as men.

[Sketch of a Plan.]

I need hardly mention that the choice of the place will in some measure direct the construction of these houses, so that I only give the outlines, or the sketch of a plan which my late worthy friend and colleague Dr. Fothergill, and myself intended for one of the Penitentiary houses. (See plate XX.) The elevation is in a great measure taken from the Cloth-hall at Halifax. I must, however, observe, that further consideration has induced me to prefer a spacious walk, clear of buildings, through the centre, with three

* "The Act of Parliament for Penitentiary houses was originally founded on the principal regulations of the Dutch rasp-houses and spin-houses;" but has received many alterations and improvements. Should this Act be put in execution, the best information both upon the ancient and present state of those houses, may be found in Pontanus's Latin, and Wagenaar's Dutch Description of Amsterdam; as they give the fullest, and most satisfactory account of them.

[Penitentiary Houses.]

courts on each side, and the chapel and chaplain's apartments at the opposite end, facing the governor's own apartments. I would wish that the rooms for solitary confinement at night were not too small, and would plead for the cheering influence of light, as well as of air, in them. The lazaretto at Zante came up to my ideas of the construction of a Penitentiary house, or house of correction, more, I think, than any building I have yet seen. It also had that exposure to the salutary influence of the breezes, and that cheerfulness of aspect, which are so necessary to relieve the languor attending sickness and confinement.

I conclude this subject in the words of an elegant writer, in the prefatory observations on a draught of a bill to punish by imprisonment and hard labour &c. that, "if a beginning be once made, by adopting such a plan as may appear the least liable to objections (for none can be entirely free from them) it must be left to time, experience, and the wisdom of subsequent sessions, to revise, improve, and mature it. Many useful and essential amendments may, even at present, be expected from others who will give their immediate attention: and much must ultimately depend on the active, judicious, and discreet concurrence of magistrates and gentlemen of weight in the different parts of the kingdom: for it will be impossible, in the first introduction of so great an establishment, to foresee and prescribe the whole detail of rules necessary to be observed; and indeed it will be better, in every respect, to leave that detail, under proper checks and restrictions, to be hereafter planned and settled in the several districts to be established."

[Petersburg House of Correction.]

In my publication in 1784, I gave an account of a house of correction at Petersburg House which was then nearly finished. I was desirous of giving the plan; but the drawing of not having been received in time for that publication, it is here inserted. (See plate XXI.) It is an elegant, though plain building, with fifty-seven windows in front, and two galleries at the back-front, supported by pillars. There is an ascent of a few steps to the first floor; all the staircases are stone (five feet wide); the rooms are about thirty-three feet by twenty-three; the windows six feet from the floor; the cielings are lofty, in the middle of which are apertures, fourteen inches square; and the roof consists of thin on plates.*

* At Moscow, the ancient capital of Russia, I found no traces of any such prisons or dungeons as were common formerly in the castles of England, and in several foreign countries. That cruel mode of confinement in many of our prisons, has been, and still is a principal cause of the gaol-fever; no symptoms of which did I see in Petersburg, Moscow, or in any part of Russia.

REMARKS

ON THE

GAOL-FEVER.*

[Gaol-Fever.]

I shall take the liberty here to subjoin a few additional remarks on the gaol-fever; in which, if I shall appear to have invaded the province of the gentlemen of the faculty, I hope to be pardoned, from the consideration that my experience in this matter may, in some degree, supply my want of other means of knowledge.

If it were asked, what is the cause of the gaol-fever? it would in general be readily replied, "the want of fresh air and cleanliness." But as I have found in some prisons abroad, cells and dungeons as offensive and dirty as any I have observed in this country, where, however, this distemper was unknown, I am obliged to look out for some additional cause for its production. I am of opinion, that the sudden change of diet and lodging so affects the spirits of new convicts, that the general causes of putrid fevers exert an immediate effect upon them. Hence it is common to see them sicken and die in a short time, with very little apparent illness. Convicts are generally stout robust young men, who have been accustomed to free diet, tolerable lodgings, and vigorous exercise. These are ironed, and thrust into close offensive dungeons, and there chained down, some of them, without straw or other bedding; in which they continue, in winter, sixteen or seventeen hours out of the twenty-four, in utter inactivity, and immersed in the noxious effluvia of their own bodies. On this account, the gaol-distemper is always observed to reign more in our prisons during winter than summer†; contrary, I presume, to the nature of other putrid diseases. Their diet is at the same time low and scanty; they are generally without firing; and the powers of life soon become incapable of resisting so many causes of sickness and despair.

* As the gaol-fever has an immediate connexion with the subjects on which I have been treating, for the sake of such readers as may not have seen what I have formerly said upon it, I here copy it, with a little variation, from my last publication.

† In conversation with the physician to the military hospital at Moscow, on my observing that the windows of the wards were shut; he answered, "Almost all our disorders are in winter, for the Russians enclose themselves in hot rooms, and dislike the fresh air, even before the cold months commence."

232 GAOL-FEVER.

[Gaol-Fever.]

On my visits in 1779, I found only one person ill of the gaol-fever: he was in Newgate, under sentence of death. In 1782, I did not find a single person labouring under that disorder throughout the whole kingdom. But in 1783, when the prisons became crowded in consequence of the peace, I was sorry to observe, that through the original faulty construction of many of them, and the want of attention in magistrates properly to inspect them, and enforce the orders of the Act for preserving the health of prisoners, they were beginning to return to their former wretched state.

Several instances of alarming and fatal sickness in gaols have been communicated to me; some of which I have seen, and noted in their proper places. I have to remark, however, that it appears doubtful to me, whether, in some of these, the disorder was the proper gaol-fever, produced in and peculiar to such situations; or an epidemic disease, which attacked prisoners only in common with other inhabitants of the same town. It cannot be expected that gaols should be preserved free from such visitations as these: it is only to be hoped, that care and attention will be used to prevent the disease from becoming more malignant and fatal in these, than in other places.†

* It may not be improper here to put persons on their guard against an artifice not unfrequently practised by gaolers, in order to prevent a proper examination of their prisons. When a gentleman, particularly a magistrate, has come with an intention to visit the gaol, the keeper has pretended the utmost willingness to accompany him, but at the same time has artfully dropt a hint that he fears there may be some danger in it, as he is apprehensive that the fever has made its appearance among them. The visiter, alarmed, returns thanks for the kind caution, and instantly leaves the house. - On such occasions I have always the more insisted on the necessity of a close inspection; and have generally found the prison very dirty, indeed, and out of order, but no fever.

† Since my return from Turkey, I have been frequently asked what precautions I use, to preserve myself from infection; I here again answer, that next to the free goodness and mercy of the Author of my being, temperance and cleanliness are my chief preservatives. Trusting in Divine Providence, and believing myself in the way of my duty, I visit the most infectious hospitals and noxious cells; and while thus employed, I fear no evil. - However, I seldom enter an hospital or prison before breakfast; in an offensive room I avoid drawing my breath deeply; and on my return, sometimes wash my mouth and hands.

[ 233 ]

CONCLUSION.

[Conclusion.]

IN my late inquiries into the state of the prisons of this country, it has given me sincere pleasure to find, that, from the attention of the magistrates and the operation of the salutary Act for preserving the health of prisoners, the gaols of the Capital, though crowded, have been freed from that disease which formerly destroyed more persons than the hand of the executioner; and those in the country have been so much improved, that most of them may now be visited without hazard of infection; whilst the judges are secured from those risks which formerly attended them in the discharge of their important office. With satisfaction I have also observed the liberal and humane spirit which engages the public to alleviate the sufferings of prisoners in general, and particularly, to release many industrious, though unfortunate, debtors. But at this point, the spirit of improvement unhappily seems to stop, scarcely touching upon that still more important object, the reformation of morals in our prisons: yet it is obvious that if this be neglected, besides the evil consequences that must result from such a source of wickedness, a suspicion will arise, that what has been already done has proceeded, chiefly, from the selfish motive of avoiding the danger to our own health, in attending courts of judicature.

In this further reformation, it will be absolutely necessary to begin with the Capital: for as, in my former visits, when I have met with the gaol-fever in county prisons, I have been almost constantly told, that it was derived from those in London; so the corruption of manners also, flowing from that great fountain, spreads far and wide its malignant streams. In what prison in London is there a proper separation of criminals, the old from the young, convicts from the untried? Where are the night-rooms for solitary confinement and reflection? Where is any proper attention paid to sick and dying prisoners? Where are the rules and orders of magistrates for the direction of gaolers, and the government of prisoners? In what gaol are not the ears shocked with the profaneness both of prisoners and turnkeys? Where is any regard paid to the Lord's day? Where is not the afternoon of that day a time of greater concourse of visitants than any other? And, though the gaoler's taps are abolished, yet, are not publicans continually waiting to serve the prisoners, and their company? Is not beer now sold by the debtors? And do not turnkeys keep shops in the gaols?

234 CONCLUSION.

[Conclusion.]

No effectual reform will be made in our prisons till the root of these evils be cut off, which, from the closest observation, I am convinced is the vice of drunkenness. To this end, restraints must be laid, which will, to many, I am sensible, appear harsh and severe; but, in this matter, there is no medium: any indulgence to particular classes of prisoners will ruin the whole design. It will, in my idea, according to the annexed draught of a bill, be absolutely necessary to prohibit the introduction of any kind of liquor except milk, whey, butter-milk, or water into gaols; and in order to diminish the apparent hardship upon debtors, I heartily wish that such an alteration were made in our laws with respect to confinement for debt, that none should undergo it but dishonest and fraudulent debtors. Such are criminals, and ought to be treated accordingly.

With regard to the health and real comfort of prisoners, I am persuaded, they would be promoted by such a prohibition. Within fourteen years, how many prisoners, together with their keepers, have I known destroyed by drinking, and how many convicts, going out of the world, in a state of intoxication! Criminals are, for the most part, under the middle age of life, and therefore strong enough in constitution to bear the trial of thoroughly breaking their bad habits; and as to debtors,* who generally live in prisons in utter idleness, they can have little occasion for strong liquors, and would receive much more benefit from a little addition of meat and vegetables to their diet, which, by this restriction, they might better afford.†

After all, the best laws will fail in their effect, unless the assiduous and zealous endeavours of magistrates be exerted in a strict attention to their execution. Abuses, though ever so studiously guarded against, will creep in; and it requires the utmost vigilance to detect, and resolution to reform them. If I have been able to point out any of these, and to suggest their causes and remedies, it has been by that close, attention to one object, which has in some measure supplied the want of original abilities, and given me clearer notions, and a more decided opinion upon these matters.

* Of this class how many persons have I known, or heard of, who have gone into prison sober men; but, who have either destroyed themselves there by drinking, or have gone out mere sots?

† If Gentlemen of the Faculty, and others, still object to the exclusion of all fermented liquors from gaols, under the idea that their use is in some measure necessary as antiseptics, I would desire them to consider, that by the proposed dietary prisoners are to have a warm dish, chiefly of vegetables, twice a day; - and that of female prisoners, who in general drink very little beer, a small proportion, compared with the men, die in prison. - I am sensible my ideas are contrary to the present mode of prescription, which, I am persuaded, confirms the habit of drinking strong liquors, both in town and country; but may I not hope, that the opinions of medical gentlemen will, in time, alter as much upon the subject, as I have seen in their treatment of the small-pox?

CONCLUSION. 235

[Conclusion.]

To my country I commit the result of my past labours. It is my intention again to quit it for the purpose of revisiting Russia, Turkey, and some other countries, and extending my tour in the East. I am not insensible of the dangers that must attend such a journey. Trusting, however, in the protection of that kind Providence which has hitherto preserved me, I calmly and cheerfully commit myself to the disposal of unerring wisdom. Should it please God to cut off my life in the prosecution of this design, let not my conduct be uncandidly imputed to rashness or enthusiasm, but to a serious, deliberate conviction that I am pursuing the path of duty; and to a sincere desire of being made an instrument of more extensive usefulness to my fellow-creatures than could be expected in the narrower circle of a retired life.

DRAUGHT OF A BILL.

[Draught of A Bill.]

Whereas the good and wholesome Laws made for the better regulation of the Gaols of this Kingdom, and for preventing Drunkenness and Rioting therein, have not proved sufficiently effectual to answer the purposes thereby intended, May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and Be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same. That from and after the twenty-ninth day of September one thousand seven hundred and ____ no gaoler, keeper, or officer of any gaol, prison, or house of correction, or any person or persons in trust for, or employed by such gaoler, keeper, or other officer, shall permit or suffer any liquor of any sort to be brought in, sold, given away, or used in any such gaol, prison, or house of correction, save and except milk, whey, butter-milk, or water; and every such gaoler, keeper, or officer offending therein, shall, for every such offence, forfeit and lose the sum of one hundred pounds, one moiety thereof to the informer and the other moiety thereof to the treasurer of the county where the offence shall be committed, to be applied to the use of the county stock; the said penalty to be sued for in any of his Majesty's courts of record at Westminster, by action of debt, bill, plaint or information; and in case any such gaoler or other officer, being convicted thereof as aforesaid, shall again offend in like manner, and be thereof a second time lawfully convicted, such second offence shall be deemed a forfeiture of his office.

And be it further enacted, that if any person or persons shall carry, or bring, or attempt or endeavour by any clandestine ways or means to carry or bring, into any gaol, prison, or house of correction, any liquor of any sort or kind, other than milk, whey, butter-milk, or water; it shall be lawful for the gaol-keeper or other officer of such gaol, prison, or house of correction, or his or their servants to apprehend such

236 CONCLUSION

[Draught of A Bill.]

person or persons, and to carry him, her, or them before a justice of the peace of the county, division, city, town corporate, or liberty where such gaol, prison, or house of correction shall be situated, who is hereby empowered to hear and determine such offence in a summary way; and if by the oath of one credible witness, or otherwise, he shall convict such person or persons of such offence, he shall forthwith commit such offender or offenders to prison, or to the house of correction, there to be kept in custody for any time not exceeding three months, without bail or mainprize, unless such offender or offenders shall immediately pay down such sum or sums of money, not exceeding ten pounds, and not less than five pounds, as the said justice shall impose as a fine, to be paid one moiety to the informer and the other moiety to the treasurer of the county stock, to be applied for the benefit of the stock of the said county, division, town, or liberty, where such gaol or house of correction shall be situated.

Provided always, and be it further enacted, that nothing herein before contained shall extend or be construed to extend to any person bringing liquors into the house of the gaoler for the use of the private family of the said gaoler, or keeper of such house of correction, and delivering the same into the hands of the said gaoler; nor to any person bringing into any infirmary in any gaol or house of correction any liquor or medicine prescribed by any surgeon or apothecary appointed to attend such gaol or house of correction, and delivering the same into the hands of such surgeon or apothecary or other person appointed by such surgeon or apothecary to receive the same.

And be it further enacted, that the several justices of the peace, at their quarter sessions assembled, are hereby authorised and required to order and direct the several articles mentioned and contained in the schedule hereunto annexed, to be delivered and supplied to any prisoner who shall be committed to any gaol, prison, or house of correction, for any treason, felony, trespass or misdemeanor, for the subsistence and support of such prisoner, during the time of his confinement there; and shall likewise order and direct that the rooms in any gaol set apart as an infirmary for the sick prisoners shall be provided with a sufficient number of straw beds, the straw thereof to be changed once in every month at the least, and shall also direct a proper supply of sheets, rugs or other coverlets for the said beds, and also a proper quantity of linen, and necessary clothing to be worn by the said prisoners, and shall also order that from Michaelmas to Lady-Day a fire shall be kept in the room used by the said prisoners as their common or day-room; Provided always that no contract for the supply of any gaol with provisions, bedding, fuel, or any other articles whatsoever shall be made with any person or persons keeping any gaol, prison, or house of correction, or any other person employed in or about the same, nor with any person for the use of any gaoler, or keeper of any prison or house of correction, so that he or they shall have any interest therein, or benefit therefrom.

CONCLUSION. 237

[Draught of A Bill.]

And be it further enacted, that the expenses attending the execution of the orders of the said justices, made in pursuance of this Act, so far as the same respects county gaols, shall be borne and defrayed out of the respective county rates; and so far as the same shall respect the gaols and prisons of particular cities, towns corporate, liberties or places that do not contribute to the rates of the counties where they are respectively situated, such expenses shall be defrayed out of the public stock or rates of such cities, towns corporate, liberties or places, having an exclusive jurisdiction to which such gaols shall respectively belong.

And be it further enacted, that all prisoners adjudged to be guilty of felony shall be confined and kept separate from the other prisoners confined in such gaols, prisons, or houses of correction, and shall also be put in separate cells, apart from each other, by night, and all other prisoners committed for trial, or confined for the non-payment of fines, shall also be kept separate and apart by night, as far as the structure of the said several gaols in which they may be confined will admit.

And be it further enacted, that each cell or night-room shall be furnished with proper bedding &c. and that no prisoner or prisoners who are not disorderly shall be closely confined in his or their cells or rooms; but they shall be out in the court or yard some hours every day.

And be it further enacted, that every prisoner acquitted or discharged by bill returned ignoramus by the Grand Jury, or on trial, or by proclamation, or on having his Majesty's free pardon, shall in the presence of the Judge of assize, if at the sessions of Oyer and Terminer or gaol delivery, or of the Justices in their quarter sessions, if at the quarter sessions, immediately after such his or her acquittal or discharge or pardon, have his irons taken off in open court, and be at liberty to depart, and shall not be detained on account of any fees whatsoever, or for any debt contracted during his or her imprisonment claimed by any gaoler or keeper of any prison or house of correction under any pretence whatsoever.

And whereas the great number of persons that daily resort to prisoners confined in the different gaols promotes rioting and debauchery, and tends to the commission of further crimes, and to facilitate escapes from the said gaols; Be it therefore enacted, that no person shall be admitted into any gaol, prison, or house of correction, to visit any prisoner therein confined for debt, but on three days of the week, namely, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and then only three persons on each of those days to each prisoner so confined, and that no person shall be admitted to visit any prisoner committed for any treason, felony, or breach of the peace, or misdemeanor, but on Friday in each week, and then only two persons on such day to each prisoner so confined.

238 CONCLUSION.

[Draught of A Bill.]

Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall extend to the excluding of any persons employed in and about such gaols and prisons for the necessary purposes thereof, nor any person coming to execute any legal process, or for the purpose of procuring any affidavit or any attestation from any prisoner therein confined, nor the Judge of assize or Grand Jury at any assizes, nor any Magistrate of the county where such gaols shall be situated, nor any person authorised under the hand and seal of any such magistrate, to visit the said gaol or any prisoner therein, nor any clergyman or minister of any religious sect or persuasion.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that every person committed by virtue of any writ, process, or action, or attachment, shall, at seasonable times in the daytime, send for, or have brought to him, her or them any victuals or necessary food, from what place he she or they shall think fit, or can have the same: and that one or more servant or servants of the gaoler or keeper shall in the morning of every day in the week. (Sunday only excepted) go out to order, purchase, or provide such victuais, or other necessary food, at the free will and pleasure of such person or persons under confinement.

And be it further enacted, that every gaoler, or keeper of every gaol, prison, or house of correction, shall on or before the twenty-ninth day of September one thousand seven hundred and ____ cause one or more copies of this Act to be painted on a board,

and hung up in some of the most conspicuous or public places in such gaol, prison, or house of correction, and renew the same from time to time, so that it may always be kept fair and legible, on pain of forfeiting the sum of forty shillings to be levied by warrant of any justice of the county, city, town corporate, liberty, division, or place where such gaol, prison, or house of correction shall be situated; and it shall be lawful for any justice to enter into such gaol and demand a sight of such copy so to be hung up as aforesaid, and if the same shall not be forthwith shewn him so hung up in some public place, fair and legible, as aforesaid, such justice shall and may immediately convict such gaoler or keeper of such default, and so from time to time as often as such default shall be made, one moiety of the said penalty to be paid to the informer and the other moiety (or the whole if there be no informer) to the treasurer of the county, to be applied to the stock of the said county.

As I have in one or two places referred to the Rules for the Prisoners of War that I gave in my last publication, which I found adopted in France as well as in England, it may not be displeasing to some of my readers to have them brought to their recollection, and to others who have not seen them, to find them here reprinted,

TABLE I.

Regulations for Prisoners of War in England &c.

V. Quiconque s'échappera de prison, étant répris, y sera mis au cachot; et n'y aura que demi-ration de vivres, jusqu' à ce qu'il aura ainsi payé les frais faits pour le saisir et le ramener; et de plus il perdra son tour d'èchange; un officier ainsi contrevenant, sera dés-lors regardé et traite comme simple matelot.

Les boutiquiers (excepté ceux qui trafiquent dans des choses qu'il ne convient pas de vendre à des prisonniers,) seront permis de rester à la grande porte, depuis dix heures du matin jusqu' à trois heures de l'apres midi, pour vendre leur merchandises, à tels prisonniers, qui sont en fonds pour les payer sur le champ.

XI. Celui d'entre les prisonniers qui ofera par ce moyen procurer des liqueurs, ou autre choses &ca. qui ne conviennent pas a ùn prisonnier d'avoir, ou qui recevra, oú livrera aucune lettre, sera puni de l'abus qu'il aura salt de cette indulgence.

* The table here referred to is in page 129.

BY THE KING.

Rules to be observed by all Prisoners of War in the Kingdom of France.

Article I. The orders given by the commissary of the marines encharged with the care of the prisoners are to be strictly complied with unargued and undisputed. None of the prisoners shall insult, threaten or abuse, much less strike the turnkey, nor any of those appointed to do business in the prison, under the penalty of incurring such punishment as shall be ordered by the commissary of the marines, and of losing turn of being exchanged; nay further they shall be close confined and deprived of one half of their food or pittance.

Art. II. All and every prisoner, when the commissary makes review, shall answer to their name or names, and if in the list delivered to the commissary there be found any error, they shall point it out, that it may be rectified, in order to prevent the confusion that might result from mistaking of names.

Art. III. All prisoners that shall refuse to answer to their names at the review, shall be punished by being deprived of their food till such time as they shall submit to the call.

Art. IV. If there happen any damage to the place where the prisoners are kept, whether it be with intent to make an escape, or otherwise, purposely and wilfully committed, the expense for repairing such damage shall be paid out of the food of those that are found guilty of the infringement; and if there be no means of discovering the guilty persons, all the prisoners shall contribute an equal share out of their food to the charges of such repair.

Art. V. Whoever after escape from his prison is retaken, shall be shut in a dungeon, and shall be stinted to half his pittance of food, till he has by this confinement satisfied for the expenses made for seizing and bringing him back to gaol, and shall lose his turn of exchange besides. A sea-officer thus contravening, shall from that moment be looked upon and treated as a common sailor.

Art. VI. It is forbidden to fight, quarrel, or make any riot in the prisons or places where the prisoners are allowed to take the air, under pain of incurring such punishment as the offence may require.

TABLES. 241

Art. VII. The prisons shall be kept clean and neat by the sailors, every man in his turn, as shall be regulated, and whatever sailor shall refuse this service in his turn, his food shall be withheld from him till he submit to it.

Art. VIII. The prisoners are to inform the commissary of the clothes or other necessaries they may want, and can pay for, and the commissary shall not only allow them to be provided with such things, but shall also take care they be not imposed upon in the price.

Art. IX. In every prison the prisoners may appoint three or five of themselves, and change them at their pleasure, in order to inspect their victuals and fee if they be good, and if they have their share or portion, whether in weight or measure, according to the following victualling table; and if there arise any reason for complaint, either of dressing, serving them up, or otherwise, they are with decency to apprise the commissary of it, who, finding such complaint well grounded, shall give immediate redress, and do them justice.

Art. X. It shall be allowed to tradesmen or sellers of ware (except such as deal in things that are not fit to be sold to prisoners) to wait at the great gate of the prisons from ten o'clock in the morning till three in the afternoon, in order to sell their ware to such prisoners as have wherewithal to pay for them on the spot.

Art. XI. Whatever prisoner shall dare, by this means, to take or bring in strong liquors or other things that are not fit for prisoners, or shall receive or deliver any letter, shall be punished for the abuse he has made of this facility.

I have visited all the county gaols, and almost all the other prisons; yet, as there are some few of the town prisons which I did not see, if we add twenty to the number of prisoners, we shall probably have nearly the average number of persons confined at one time in the prisons in Ireland:

viz. Debtors - 550.

Criminals - 1004.

Supposed omitted - 20.

Total - 1574.

N. B. Where I have visited twice, viz. in 1787 and 1788, I have taken, in this estimate, the last number.

An Account of the Number of Prisoners in the Gaols and of England and Wales at the last Time they were visited in 1787, or 1788.

As some County Gaols are also the County Bridewells, where petty Offenders are not always separated from Felons, in those Places I sometimes include petty Offenders under the Article Felons - In this Table I have omitted mentioning all those Prisons in which, at the times of my visiting in these two Years, there were no Persons confined.

TABLE VII,

A List of Fees due to the Clerks of Assize* of the several Circuits in England, and their Officers, from Prisoners charged with Felony — Burnt in the Hand — Whipped — Acquitted — Discharged by Proclamation — or against whom Bills are returned by the Grand-Jury not true Bills.

£. S. D.

HOME CIRCUIT. Burnt in the hand - 0 4 8

Whipped - 0 4 8

Acquitted - 0 8 4

Discharged by proclamation - 0 8 4

Recording every ignoramus in felony - 0 6 4†

NORFOLK CIRCUIT. Acquittal and order of delivery in murder - 1 8 0

The like in all other felonies - 1 1 4

Order of delivery on proclamation - 0 15 8

Ditto on ignoramus bill - 0 13 4

MIDLAND CIRCUIT. Acquittal and discharge fee in murder - 1 7 8

The like in all other felonies - 1 6 8

Discharge fee on recording ignoramus bill - 1 0 0

Discharge fee on proclamation - 0 13 4

OXFORD CIRCUIT. For every prisoner acquitted of felony on one indidbnent discharged - 0 17 8

For every acquittal after the first - 0 8 8

For every prisoner discharged by proclamation - 0 9 0

Guilty burnt in the hand or whipped and discharged - 0 14 0

WESTERN CIRCUIT. Acquitted including Plea and Discharge — 1 10 8

Ignoramus 13s. 4d. and Discharge 13s. 4d. — 1 6 8

Discharge by Proclamation — 0 13 4

Conviction in Man-slaughter — 0 17 4

NORTHERN CIRCUIT. Not guilty discharged - 1 5 4

Discharged by proclamation - 0 14 8

* The Clerks of assize give to the judges large sums for their places. One of the present gentlemen gave for his place two thousand five hundred pounds. On many accounts these places ought not to be bought of the judges. If they were only presented, the fees might be much lower. - The demand from several gaolers for a copy of the judge's calendar is now £1: 1: 0. whereas his Majesty's Commissioners for inquiring into the Officers and their fees &c. in the Home Circuit, were of opinion that a demand not near so much was enormous, as we see in their report dated 1st December 1735 (M.S. page 21;)

"Paid by the goaler of the County of Surrey for the copy of a calendar - £ 0 7 6

"And by the gaoler of each of the other countys - 0 5 0

As to these two last Fees or articles, We are of opinion that they are unreasonable and no ways to be justified. &c."

† "We present this as a very hard and unreasonable fee to be executed and taken of a person who must be supposed (by the Bill being found Ignoramus) to be innocent of the charge alledged against him in such a bill, and therefore in our opinion is not to be justified, &c."

Report of his Majesty's Commissioners appointed to inquire into the Officers and their fees &c. of the Courts within the Home-Circuit. Dated Dec. 1st, 1735. M.S. page 11.

Of the hundred and twenty Sessions in the fifteen Years of Peace (eight in a Year) only one was Maiden, in 1749. - Of sixty-four Sessions in the eight Years of War, nine were Maiden.

Sir Stephen intending a list only of those who were condemned to die, has not in his table a column for transport convicts. But at the bottom of the sheet he notes that there were

Transported for seven or fourteen years - 5199

To which number he adds

Transported by the King's mercy (after receiving sentence of death) - 401

Total Transports - 5600

The second number of transports 401 is, doubtless, part of the number 443, the last of the three totals above.

I persuade myself that my readers will excuse the insertion of several Tables here which I have before given in my last publication, as this book may fall into the hands of some who have not the other in their possession. And may I not indulge the hope that, many years after I shall be dead and forgotten, these Tables, being of a public nature, will be occasionally reviewed, and may have inferences drawn from them which will, in their consequences, contribute to alleviate the miseries of mankind, and add something to the general stock of happiness among the human race?

December 27th, 1788, there remain 34 Convicts under sentence of death, of whom no report hath been made, on account of his Majesty's indisposition.

These tables, together with Sir Stephen Theodore Janssen's give the total number of executions for forty years past.

[ 259 ]

I shall now close this work with suggesting a plan which I think would, if adopted, be attended with public utility.

Since the office of a Gaoler or Keeper of a Prison is very important, and, when discharged with fidelity and humanity, deserves great encouragement; and as the late Act prohibits women from being keepers; I could wish that there should be a small provision made by an annuity for the widow or children of every faithful and attentive gaoler who dies in that office; not out of the succeeding gaoler's salary, but clear and independent thereof. I have known some valuable keepers, and their wives, die of the gaol-fever; and is it not a distressing consideration that such persons, though they have properly attended to their duty, should leave families unprovided for? Who would not regret that such men as George Smith, late keeper of Tothill-fields bridewell,* should be exposed to the unhappiness of leaving a wife, or children, or both, without any comfortable provision for their support? This object appears the more desirable, as it may now be hoped that the abolition of the tap, and the allowance of salaries in lieu of the profits which were derived from the sale of liquors, will be the means of engaging people of more credit, and who will pay greater attention to their duty, to undertake the office of gaolers or keepers of prisons. Such persons I have observed to be placed in foreign prisons; and among them, some of their wives take a very active part, looking frequently in upon the prisoners of their own sex, and paying a kind attention to them.

Should the plan take place, during my life, of establishing a permanent charity, under some such title as that at Philadelphia, viz. A society for alleviating the miseries of public prisons, and annuities be engrafted thereupon for the abovementioned purpose, I would most readily stand at the bottom of a page as a subscriber of £500; or if such a society shall be constituted within three years after my death, this sum shall be paid out of my estate.

* Mr. George Smith, who died in 1786, was keeper of Tothill-fields bridewell at my first visit in April 1774: and my many subsequent visits fully convinced me of his integrity and humanity. He was a striking example of a constant, unabated zeal in the discharge of the important trust reposed in him.

FROM JOHN HAYGARTH, M.D.

APPENDIX.

INTRODUCTION.

IN the account of the principal Lazarettos in Europe, Which I published the beginning of the year 1789, I mentioned that it was my intention again to quit my country, for the purpose of re-visiting Russia, Turkey, and some other countries, and adding an Appendix to that work; as I wished to gain further knowledge on a subject that for some years had engaged my attention; and with the hope that the torch of philanthropy might be conveyed into remote countries. In confidence on God, who had been my help, I cheerfully set out on my journey, and dame to Amsterdam the 7th of July, 1789; where I first visited the hospitals for the sick.

[Holland.]

[Amsterdam.]

In the City Hospital, the apertures that have been lately made in the ceiling of the men's ward, make that room fresher than the women's lofty ward; and I observed to the physician, whom I met on one of my visits, that in such long wards, a window, such as was in Guy's Hospital, (of which I shewed him the model) from the ceiling to the floor, would be proper. All the wards were clean; but the patients, neither in their linen nor persons, were so attentive to cleanliness as might have been wished; a fault which the prejudice of the faculty, relative to the unsalutariness of fresh linen, has to answer for. The black stone or marble floor made the doctor put on flippers over his shoes: I could not but wish the floor was boarded round the patients beds.

The Pest-house is out of the city. At both my visits, I had the pleasure to find every ward sweet and clean, the patients calm and quiet, and that order that I wish to find in all hospitals. This I the more readily mention, as the state of this house occasioned me to censure it in a former work. Here were 107 men and 129 women.

4 HOLLAND.

In the Stadt-house many judicious alterations have been made in the debtors' room, by the worthy president, burgomaster Randolp; and in a further allowance to the aliment of prisoners. He, with Mr. Sheriff Hartsinck, did me the honor to accompany me into the dungeons, and other prison-rooms. The torture-chamber, and the different engines and modes of torture, to force a confession of a suspected crime, I give no account of, as I know those amiable magistrates wish such a practice abolished. There were six criminals and twenty-three debtors.

I visited the Rasp-house: the prisoners task is not heavy (50 of logwood) as they have all done at three o'clock: their friends are allowed to visit them in the court three days in the week, viz. Monday, Thursday, and Friday, but must pay two stivers, as all other persons, to the keeper. The court not washed, and is offensive. One of my visits was on a Sunday morning, to attend the public service, which began in the chapel at nine o'clock. The prisoners, between 70 and 80, came decently in, and seated themselves on benches. One on the first form flood up, and called over by his lift all their names, to which each answered. The chaplain then-began the service with a short extempore prayer; he read a psalm, and most of the prisoners having books, they sung; he then prayed for a quarter of an hour, and afterwards preached then catechised ten of the prisoners, and expounded each of the questions to them. He again prayed, sung an hymn, and concluded with a short prayer. The service continued two hours: the prisoners, who were neat and clean, behaved with the greatest decency and attention; not even a smile or whisper did I see amongst them. One having for a few minutes dozed, the chaplain flopped and reprimanded him; he made a very humble excuse: the keeper immediately ordered a stoppage of his tobacco; but as he was one of the catechumens who was most expect in his answers, it was made up to him. The Jews are, very properly, excused attending. Not the least noise in the court; which I should have heard, as I sat close to the window. - I have formerly mentioned the abridgment of the term of confinement at Lady-day by the old magistrates, who examine the books, and attend to the report of the chaplain and keeper; which is a strong incentive to the decent, diligent, and proper behaviour of prisoners. I must again remark, that the children of these persons, as of those who are executed for capital crimes, are not left destitute vagabonds, but are brought up in the orphan-house, that they may not be inheritors of the folly and wickedness of their parents. In the new workhouse, July 13, there were 730 prisoners.

The Infirmary was somewhat cleaner than at my former visit, but the patients had no sheets; the other bed-rooms full of vermin: the mendicants too thinly clad, by stuff spun and wove in the house. That part called the Spin-house is under another direction: here all was in order; prisoners at work; the notable mistress at her desk: her rooms all neat and clean, linen on the beds, and these prisoners much warmer and better clothed. This department, from many years observation and visits, seems to me the best model of a house for the correction and reformation of the faulty of the female sex.

The sheriff was so kind as to give me the list of the executions at Amsterdam, with the names and crimes of the sufferers, from the beginning of the year 1780, to the

HOLLAND. 5

time I was there in 1789; by which I find only nine persons have, during that period, been executed in that populous and trading city*.

* In a former publication I mentioned the number of deaths in Amsterdam, to the year 1782. I now continue it, with -

1783 - 9,144

1784 - 10,301

1785 - 7,108

1786 - 7,801

1787 - 8,612

1788 - 10,354

I add.

Extracts of Observations on the populousness of Amsterdam; by Dr. Houttuyn ,published in 1783.

This gentleman supposes that there are, in Amsterdam, at least 200,000 souls; and supports his hypothesis by the following arguments.

1. In the year 1622, the inhabitants were numbered, and found to be about 100,000; the yearly number of deaths was then, on an average, full 4,000. The yearly number of deaths is now full 8,000; consequently the number of inhabitants may be estimated at 200,000;

2. In the year 1768, the number of inhabited houses was nearly 30,000; and the Doctor supposes, that from that time to 1783, there was an annual increase of 50 houses, which brings the number, in 1783, to 30,750. Reckoning, therefore, 7 persons to every house, the number will be 215,250 souls. - N.B. Maitland, in estimating the populousness of London, supposes 15 persons to every two houses.

3. The number of families, in the year 1747, were found to be 41,561; and, from the additional houses built since that time, he estimates the number to be increased to 46,000; reckoning these at only 4½ to each family, the number of souls will amount to 207,000; if the families be estimated at five persons each, the amount will be 230,000.

4. This calculation is further confirmed by the number of members of the several religious persuasions. Of the Dutch established church, the number of communicants is 70,000. As these are seldom received as such till sixteen years of age, the Doctor adds 35,000 for those who are younger, agreeable to Dr. Halley's estimate, that, of the number of those actually living, 3-10ths are under 15½ years old.

Thus the communicants of the established church are - 70,000

Add non-communicants - 35,000

- 105,000

Lutherans, communicants - 30,000

Add ½ non-communicants - 15,000

- 45,000

Roman Catholics, communicants - 30,000

Add ⅓ non-communicants, because admitted younger - 10,000

- 40,000

Arminians, Anabaptists, &c. - 10,000

Jews, who increase very much yearly - 20,000

According to this calculation - 220,000 souls.

6 OSNABURG. HANOVER.

[Utrecht.]

In the Stadt-heuse at Utrecht, there were no prisoners for capital crimes. A few men for small offences were on bread and water; as I have seen in Germany for drunkenness, and riot; a longer or shorter term being left to the discretion of the magistrate. - I have mentioned in my former publications, that there had been no execution in the city or province the last twenty years; I have now further to add, that there has been none since my first visit in 1776.

[Osnaburgh.]

The prison at Osnaburgh is both the gaol and house of correction, the description of which I gave in my former publications. The floor below the ground is for capital offenders: the cells are close, dark, and offensive; they open into strong passages. In one of these was a poor object, who was ironed hands and feet, and also chained to the wall of his cell. His wife I found in an offensive and dark cell, in an upper floor, weeping and bitterly lamenting her unhappy situation. I waited on the chief magistrate, who very readily and kindly assured me, that orders should be immediately given to soften the rigour of her confinement, and that the door of her room should be kept open into the passage. On that floor, appropriated for correction, there were eight men and seven women; they were clothed in brown and blue coats, and were employed in spinning. They are properly fed in three meals, and have one pound and a half of bread, a good bowl of greens, and a pint and a half of beer a day, all of which I found good of the sort. These rooms also were, as on my former visits, very dirty and offensive; this I mentioned to Le Baron de Borsch; he said the prisoners should, as in Holland, have the Saturdays entirely devoted to the washing and cleaning the house; which is the more necessary as there is no court to this prison. These prisoners attend public worship, where there is service on Sundays, one part of the day for Protestants, the other for Roman Catholics; and each chaplain has his (proper) desk, for his books and ornaments. The Jews have every indulgence, as to their sabbath, diet, and clothes. I have formerly mentioned, that the mode of torture here, is more excruciating than in most other countries; and is known by the name of the Osnaburgh torture, and this has still been improved upon by a conseiller from Paderborn.

[Hanover.]

At Hanover there were no criminals for capital offences in the prison on July 22d. In rooms up stairs there were seven prisoners; one a very pale object. On observing several chalk marks in his room, he said they were the weeks of his confinement (42) and his process not finished. Others were not begun. This I have hinted at before; but this well-known evil still continues. I also, in my last publication, said, that the execrable practice of torturing prisoners is here used. I am sorry to say it is not abolished, but still in the power of magistrates to inflict.

In October 1781, I had the honor to wait on his royal highness the Bishop of Osnaburgh in the castle. I then informed him, that his executioner had lately been brought hither to inflict the Osnaburgh torture on a criminal. His royal highness desired some description of it: the cruel mode struck his highness; and I then referred him to the judge, who was present; adding, that in this tour I had been in Sweden, where, by a

HANOVER. 7

late good and popular act of the king, torture was abolished, and that the door into that cellar in the prison at Stockholm was ordered to be closed and bricked up*. - I beg leave, on this subject, to copy the late king of Prussia's order† for the abolition of the torture, who set the noble example the 3d of June 1740.

* Have I not often reason, with a sigh, to say, "I labour in vain, and spend my strength for nought?" But I have resolved, by the help of God, to give myself wholly to this work.

Note. In France, by the "Decret sur la reformation provisoire de la procedure criminelle," de Samedi 11 Octobre 1789, l'Assemblee Nationale considere que "L'usage de la fellette au dernier interrogatoire, et la question dans tout les cas, font abolis."

"In all other cases, where the delinquents, notwithstanding the cleared proofs and strongest evidence of many valid and legal witnesses, and the like, persist, by a malicious obstinacy, in not owning their guilt, they shall be punished according to the law.

8 HANOVER.

The orphan house and house of correction, which is out of the town, was in great order; but, on seeing the children at dinner, I could not help observing that, by their countenances, something was wrong in that house, as they had a pale and uneasy look. We afterwards found the bed-rooms dirty, the bedding scanty, and no linen to them; the children fed by the master, at 1 gros and 1 feng each, The good burgomaster Alemann, the noble founder of this institution, is dead since my last visit; but I am persuaded his kinsman, Mr. Conseiller Falke, the present director, will make some alterations for the benefit of this establishment.

The orphan house and house of correction for the town, is an old building, and not very clean; yet, the children had a more healthy and cheerful look than those I last visited: they, I found, were better fed, and had linen on their beds. The prison part for men was empty; but the room for women, in which were 10 or 12, was very dirty, and intolerably offensive. In this house I saw Mr. Conseiller Falke, with the minister, and two or three other gentlemen, distribute the weekly allowance to the poor, who received what was given them with thankfulness, and retired in great order: those (poor) women, who did not refuse to sweep the streets, had a small addition made to their allowance. The town is divided into seven districts; to each of which is appointed a respectable person, to whom the poor, in case of sickness, make application, and he makes his report to a magistrate appointed for that purpose, who directly orders the physician of that district to attend such pauper. The physician makes his report every quarter.

The hospital of St. Nicholas is an old and good institudon for freemen's widows, wives, or daughters. Here are 16 apartments, each consisting of a small room for a kitchen, a little dining-room, and a bed-chamber. The inhabitants pay about £10 on entrance, and have their apartment for life, with a little garden; and gratefully enjoy some other small emoluments belonging to this charity.

The hospital for the sick is on one large room, crowded with beds, in which are patients of both sexes.

A new military hospital is now building, on an improper spot. It is too contracted, and on a bad plan, as the rooms will be only 17 feet by about 8½, and these will open into a dark passage about 6½ feet wide.

[Brunswick.]

BRUNSWICK. The tower over one of the gates, which was the prison for capital offences at my former visits, is now taken down, and such prisoners are sent to the Stadt-house. Here were on the three floors, only four prisoners; their allowance two bonne grosche a day each, which is about 3¼d. In the house of correction I read the order and conformed to it again with pleasure, viz. That decent people may inspect the house; but no more than four at a time; that they must put a florin (about 2s. 6d.) into the box, for the prisoners whose term is expired, to assist them on passing on their journey, and prevent them from begging or stealing: lastly, nothing must be given to the keepers, or

BRUNSWICK. BERLIN. 9

to the prisoners confined for punishment." Here were 41 men and 50 women; the employment, spinning and weaving. The diet is in four classes and according to their work.

I observed on the slate there were only two on the first class, or the best diet, and four on the lowest, which is 1lb. of bread, a little soup and small beer. The house was very dirty, the floors never washed, though so many women prisoners; the only clean room was the chapel on the upper floor. - But a proper attention to cleanliness ran through all the hospitals for the sick. In that for the military, there were nine rooms, but only two patients, the troops being at Maestricht. Though the torture is not abolished, I had the pleasure to hear that the last instance of a person suffering it was about eighteen years ago, and that the room had not since been opened; but by the favour of Mr. Fredersdorff, conseiller de justice, it was opened. The descent is by fifteen steps, to a dark room, in which are some of the instruments of torture: through this room is another arched room or cellar 18 feet by 15, very black and dark: at one end is a bench for the judge, lawyer, secretary and surgeon; opposite them is a table for candles, books &c. The prisoner who suffers the torture, the executioner and his man, are before them. This is done about midnight, though the thickness of the walls (three feet) the four doors (which I passed), the dirt floor, and depth under ground, must prevent the most agonizing cries from being heard any where but in that room. I saw all the remaining engines of torture, which are kept at the executioner's house. He seemed with pleasure to shew the mode of application on the first, second and last question; and very readily answered any enquiries, having been several years in that occupation at Hanover; though here (he said) he had only beheaded four or five. On asking if nothing was put into the tortured person's mouth, as I had in some places seen, he replied " No, the Osnaburgh executioner thinks they suffer less;" and on his describing some of the modes of torture (which the wit of devils and men had invented,), he said, "Sir, the Osnaburgh torture is still ruder."

[Berlin.]

But I hasten to another country, where the torture has not been inflicted for above twice eighteen years, viz. BERLIN. In the court prison there were eighteen men, debtors and smugglers, and two women spinning cotton to earn their allowance of one grosche and a half a day: the former in the upper rooms of the old prison, the latter in a new and separate part adjoining; the old dungeons being not now used. I have mentioned the punishment of smugglers standing exposed at the gate with a machine round them, called a Spanish mantle, similar to a plate I gave of it at Copenhagen. Here also is a machine in which the hands and neck of women are fastened, called a fiddle, and they stand exposed for one hour for three successive days. This prison was quiet and in great order. In the city prison there were about ninety prisoners, many of them smugglers or debtors; several prisoners in the dungeons (11 feet 9 inches by nine) their processes long; the whole prison dirty, never white-washed. In the court, there were men, women, and boys. The gaoler sells liquors of all sorts. The allowance to debtors, paid by their creditors, is two grosche a day, about 3¼d.: the criminals have 1½ grosche.

10 BERLIN. SPANDAU.

The Maison de travail I found in the same good order as in my former visits; in July there were 480 persons, vagrants &c. confined; their chief employment carding and spinning wool. In their diet they are in three classes; but the very great number of men, women, and children who were at work together in one room, and in a house where a reparation might easily be made, must in several views be improper. - In the Orphan house there were 60 boys and 60 girls; the children clean and fresh; wash three times a day; bathe every Friday; the bed-rooms clean; the boys lie single. The infirmary an old house, and too far from the hospital. - In La Charite or General Hospital, several rooms contain ten beds, and the patients pay a florin, about 2s. 6d. a week. Here are rooms for lying-in women; and apartments of two rooms for persons who pay 100 florins. In a large room, a neat table was set out for the convalescent patients, which I have often wished for in other hospitals. Here is no military hospital, but each regiment has one or two sick rooms: in each were seven or eight beds. Those I visited were clean and most of them empty, which in great part is owing to the strict discipline, constant exercising and reviewing the men, and many having wives, who also have a small weekly pay, and with their husbands a room in each caserne.

[Spandau.]

In the fortress at SPANDAU there were, August 4, 1789, a hundred and seventy-one prisoners: several of them are condemned for life: one had been here thirty-two years. Their allowance is only 2lb. of bread and water, and after the first year a frock and breeches, a shirt, a pair of stockings and one pair of shoes, annually. They are to work four hours a day for the king; and when the governor employs them as carpenters or masons, he gives them two grosche a day, equal to about 3¼d. Many of them were spinning cotton for their own emolument at their leisure hours; but several had an iron collar round their neck, the mark of their contentions and quarrels. Their rooms under the ramparts, very close, dirty, and crowded; and as the governor (Scott, our countryman) is desirous of softening the rigour of confinement, and has fitted up two rooms for the sick,

I will here take the liberty to drop a few hints. - The prisoners should not lie on shelves over the other prisoners; but there should be only one row of barrack beds, each person to be allowed two feet four inches, with an oak partition of ten inches at the head, and six inches at the feet: an aperture for light and air to be made in the centre of the vaulted rooms; and twice a year, the rooms walked by the prisoners with fresh lime and boiling water; each partition to have proper bedding, that the prisoners may not, as they now do, lie in their clothes; and also to be numbered; and no prisoner to change the place allotted him, without the consent of the governor. A room to be appropriated for a work room. The court enlarged by putting the pales 40 feet back; three or four stone basons for washing their linen; and the reservoir for soaking timber, which seemed not used, would make the most proper and salutary cold bath for them. No spirituous liquors on any account to be sold to them. The rules and orders as to cleanliness, sobriety, work &c. to be signed by the governor, and read to them in the chapel the first Sunday in every

SPANDAU. KONINGSBERG. 11

month. In the upper room of one of the towers there was a state prisoner: underneath there was a dreadful dungeon; a prisoner had been removed from thence the morning I was there. I have formerly mentioned, that women are not permitted to continue a night in the castle; but whilst I was walking with the governor, the mother of one of the prisoners humbly petitioned that she might fee her son, which was readily granted, and a guard attended her.

The House of Correction I found in the same neat and good order as in 1778 and 1781. Most of the prisoners were women; the chief employment now was spinning cotton and not wool; a small part of their earnings they have to buy a little tea, milk &c.

[Koningsberg.]

The prison is in a close part of the city; the rooms are on the two upper floors; in one of which rooms there were seven men; and in another, eight women spinning. I observed, none of the men were in irons; I was told they are never tried in irons, nor are they put on, till after conviction.* In an upper room there were eleven sick women; these I understood were not prisoners, yet, if I might conjecture, sent there to perish by nastiness and neglect.

In the House of Correction, August 13, 1789, there were 2 men and 42 women. Here was no separation of the old and young, of the lesser from the greater criminals; no inducement or hope by good behaviour of shortening their term. The first view of the countenances of the prisoners, convinced me of sad neglect: no infirmary: the sick with hardly a blanket to cover them; the men in irons. From two or three that were dying I requested the magistrates that their irons might be taken off, as the surgeon with us had no feeling for them. The sick women in three other rooms were dirty beyond description, and seemed in want of every comfort of life. The inspector and keeper, old and infirm. The magistrates, on this visit with me, were covered with vermin. I mentioned the custom in the Dutch spin-houses of devoting the whole day of Saturday to washing, and that this also introduces habits of cleanliness in the female sex.†

The old House of Correction, which was burnt down last winter, was situated near the river, and had a spacious airing ground: the two wheels or die machine for stamping dyers

* In some Roman Catholic countries, I have been informed that the priests have refused to administer the sacrament to prisoners, unless their irons were taken off.

† In several places I now take the liberty to mention what seemed to me an obvious remedy to some defect that happened to strike me. I hope it will not be thought by any gentleman, that I do it in the style of a dictator. Yet should it be asked, why I did not so generally do it in my first publications, I reply, that my purpose then was to collect what was good, with a view of a reform in my own country; as I did not think any observations of so private an individual would either reach the eye of foreign magistrates, or be attended to by them: but, it has pleased God to order it otherwise; it would therefore be, on my part, refusing to do the good offered to my endeavours, were I to abstain from such remarks as may correct abuses, and alleviate misery in all the places I visit.

12 KONINGSBERG. MEMEL. MITTAU. RIGA.

wood were not burnt. These were worked by eight men, two in each wheel, one hundred turns; and one prisoner was inspector.

Here is another house of correction, with a neat garden, and near a pleasant lake: there were about thirty prisoners in separate and clean rooms; the prisoners looked clean and healthy, which on my noticing to the keeper Gottlieb he said he had lived 37 years in Russia, and had erected a bath in his garden for bathing and sweating; and that his prisoners every Saturday in some warm room thoroughly washed and cleaned themselves. The kind attention of the magistrates, emboldened me to ask permission to copy the plan of this Russian bathing house; which the privy-counsellor readily granted. - The general hospital for the poor, sick, and insane, consists of several houses in a court. In the sick wards, I found the surgeon, who seemed sensible of the necessity of fresh air, cleanliness and a proper diet, to prolong life, and restore the health of his patients. The bread for the house was good rye bread, being well made and well baked. I mention not the closeness of the cells of the insane, as a new hospital was building for such objects of compassion.

[Memel.]

In the Castle at MEMEL, there were, August 17th 1789, 57 men and 11 women; most of them were in dark and damp rooms built against the fortifications, and without bedding. Their allowance is 2lb. of bread and water; their employment, removing the ballast that is flung out of ships. There were only 22 out at work, but at times there are so many vessels, that there is work for all the men and women. Some of the prisoners were sick, the others had a pale and languid look. If such rooms were kept clean, and scraped and lime-whited twice a year, and a little bedding were given to the prisoners, they would be more healthy, and having more light, be better enabled to gain a small trifle by their work.

[Mittau.]

At MITTAU in Courland twelve of the criminals or slaves who were in irons with a chain between each leg, as at Memel, were at work hewing and sawing timber for the palace, which was burnt last winter. I observed they were as handy and quiet as the other workmen in the court; and though I repeated my visit to them and was alone; none of them stopped their work, or gave the least hint of a request for money: three were sick, and as such were objects of compassion.

[Riga.]

The prison and house of correction (Zughthuys) is a square building in the citadel: the prison part was very dirty and offensive, and little attention paid to order, the separation of the sexes &c.; but in the Zughthuys, the prisoners had a cheerful and healthy look; the rooms were clean. Here were seven hand mills, and six men were grinding corn: in another part six women working on a lighter mill. The other prisoners who were not capable of such hard work were spinning. The former, work in summer from four to eleven, and from one to eight; and in winter from six to twelve, and from one to eight in the evening; their allowance 22g of bread and some gruel made of grits which was good.

RIGA. 13

Every fortnight these prisoners use the warm bath which adjoins to the prison. About ten miles from Riga, the slaves or condemned persons, were in a prison or ostrog, similar to that I gave the plan of at Moscow; namely, several wooden houses, surrounded with high pales. The rooms contained about 42 persons; each had his bedstead, and most of them a little bedding. The two sick rooms were clean and not sanded, fresher and more airy than the military hospital, the beds not being crowded, and each man had his bed. In one of the other rooms they were all foreigners, (42) most of them for debt, some for so small sums as three or four rubles (eight to eleven shillings) but with some unfavourable circumstances attending the debt, so that persons are not permitted immediately to discharge them. They are allowed from government twenty copecs (6½d.) a day, eight of which are for their diet, clothes &c. and the other twelve for their creditors, till the whole debt is paid off. These were also in irons and work with the criminals at the public works. In other rooms were 345 prisoners. In a small inner room, I found two Russians, sent hither about four years ago: they had a guard at the door, and had never been out of the room, and are heavy ironed both hands and feet: they are never spoken to, nor is their crime known: they had suffered the punishment of the knout, (which in my former publication I have described) and had a piece cut out of each nostril, and the mark on the cheeks, which is the signature of their condemnation for life. I saw several others thus marked for murder or other very capital crimes. All the prisoners were in irons, and work in summer from four to eleven, and from one to eight, unless sick, which the surgeon comes every morning to examine. There were 311 out, the day I was there, hewing timber, driving piles, wheeling and carrying the stones for a fine mole 65 feet wide and half a mile long, on which they had been employed six years: their allowance is six copecs a day, for which all their clothing and provision is found; the former bad, the latter very indifferent. As to religious instruction, once a year only they go to the chapel in the citadel; and on the other Sundays they amuse themselves, or make shoes &c. About a fortnight before my visit, the head knout-master was brought from St. Petersburgh, who being with the other two knout-masters at a public-house, they happened to quarrel: he immediately struck off the head of one of them; the other seeming to resent it, he dexterously decapitated him also. As no crime, not even that crying one of shedding blood, is punished in Russia with death, this man had received 270 strokes of the knout, the executioner from Moscow being brought for that purpose; and being condemned for life, was marked as before described. Here he met several of his former acquaintance to whom he had given the knout, and on being asked in how many strokes he could kill a man, he said, if a strong man, he could in five and twenty, but if not strong, in twenty strokes.

At the Stadt-House there are rooms for the town debtors, and here were only two or three: down 25 steps are two dungeons, and here was only one person and not in irons, and he could receive alms at a grated window; the Russians being very kind to such persons, as I was informed at the other prison.

14 RIGA. ST. PETERSBURG.

The military hospital is three miles out of town: it consists of several houses in a large quadrangle: at the entrance are those for the physician, surgeons, chaplains &c.: the houses for the patients consist of four double wards, and can have no opposite windows; these wards are low, dirty, and offensive, and the passages still more so, by the poisonous sewers. The beds are crowded; the sick lie on boards saturated with infection: the walls seemed never white-washed. These circumstances, even without attending to the improper diet of the patients, prevented any surprize when I was informed that four or five hundred recruits had died there the beginning of the year. At my visit, there were upwards of 400 sick.

[St. Petersburg.]

At St. PETERSBURG I took partly the same round of the prisons and hospitals that I had done just eight years before. As to the former there has been little alteration; and the new house of correction, which was then nearly finished, has never been inhabited, and is going to ruin, as many of the upper floors are fallen in; so that I now shall pass over the prisons, and with pleasure mention some of the improvements in the hospitals of this city.

The marine and military hospitals nearly join, and make a large square with a morass in the middle; which if formed into a bason with a canal into the river Neva, would be salutary and lightly. The rooms were all empty, and lately white-washed, except three, in which were venereal patients, and 36 slaves who had their irons on. All the other sick were in the summer lazaretto, which I formerly mentioned with great approbation. These are rooms made of wood in an enclosed area or garden, the size 40 feet by 26: most of them have nine windows on each of the two sides, and two opposite doors at the ends, with apertures over them. These rooms have chimnies, are floored, and are about nine inches from the (sandy) ground. They are 20 feet asunder; each room contains about 42 patients, who have separate beds. The rooms were in general clean and quiet; but some much more so than others, according to the disposition of the two (women) nurses that were allotted to each room. In the centre is the bathing house. The number given me of all the sick at one of my visits, namely, Aug. 31, 1789, was 534.

A new and splendid hospital has been erected just out of the city, and opposite a fine canal: the rooms were spacious, lofty and clean, and had been lately white-washed. Tho patients were of both sexes, in separate summer lazaretts in the adjoining court; the rooms and beds were clean and neat. Men and women prisoners come here every day; the latter to wash and clean the rooms, the former to remove what is offensive from the outside sewers of every room.

At that great institution, the house of education for noble ladies and commoners, which I gave an account of in my publication 1784, I found the good old lady Madame Lafon still presiding over it.

At the foundling and inoculating hospitals, and at that noble institution the military cadet

corps, I passed three or four mornings. In these visits I freely spoke my mind, either in commending what I thought right, or mentioning what I thought amiss endeavouring to enforce my observations by what was done in similar circumstances in other countries, or shewing the models of the windows &c. in our own.

I cannot leave St. Petersburg without mentioning a pleasant hour that I spent with the good old general De Betskoi, the enlightened and liberal head and director general of some of the greatest institutions in Russia.

[Cronstadt.]

The 9th and 10th of September 1789, I visited the marine hospital of CRONSTADT, which consists of several double wards, raised about four feet from the ground. The entrance is by dark and very offensive rooms: the wards are narrow, low, and ceiled with wood; and have no apertures: the floors were sanded, which yet did not hide the dirt: many of the beds are close to one another; and indeed little hopes can a patient have of recovery in such a foetid air. - Adjoining are eight summer lazaretts, which are airy and spacious wood buildings, each containing about 44 beds. These wards were sanded, which I object also to, as a harbour for vermin. The attendants on the sick are all men. Here were about 320 patients, and in the other wards 270. The third or upper floor of the new barracks is now used only pro tempore, for the sick: these were eight double wards; they were quite clean, being washed twice a week, and not sanded; the bedding clean, and did credit to the attention of our countryman the physician who presides over them. Here were 318 patients. Though these rooms are generally occupied by the sailors when the fleet is in the port, yet I shall take the liberty to hint, that where the ceilings are so low, there should be apertures in them, or near them in the side walls; and the upper part of the windows should open; and great attention should be paid to prevent the offensiveness of the sewers. The prevalent disorders here as at Riga were the intermittent fevers, and the scurvy, with the bloody flux. The diet within a few months has been altered, and seems directly opposite to these disorders; the patients having now no milk, rice, barley, or sage tea, no mutton or veal broth; but beef and beef broth; rye bread, which was both badly made and baked; quas sour and flat; and a vile decoction, which was brought in a tub every morning and served to all those patients who chose it. With what concern must a feeling mind be struck, when many objects are looking up for help and the probability of a cure is thus cut off!

In the old prison there were 91 criminals and about 200 slaves sent here by their masters or landlords: these latter were separated from the former, but none had any beds: the rooms very dirty, and the prisoners seemed sadly neglected.

* I mentioned in my former account, that I had seen at Cronstadt the ground marked out for a new prison which was to be erected under the superintendence of our countryman admiral Greig; but the prisoners and the sick here, as well as many others, have reason to lament the death of this good and great man; whose favourite maxim was, If I cannot do what I would, I will do what I can."

16 TWER. MOSCOW.

[Twer.]

I looked into the hospital and prison at TWER. In the former there were only about half a dozen patients; in the latter, the men and women prisoners had their separate rooms on the first floor: there are no dungeons: the prison was very dirty, and not white-washed since I was here eight years ago, when it was just built. The prisoners subsist on bread, as much as they now chuse, and the charitable contributions from the box fixed on a pillar on the outside.

[Moscow.]

The Prison or Ostrog at MOSCOW, of which I gave the plan and description in my publication in 1784, is now disused, and about four years ago its place supplied by a prison built of brick, with a surrounding wall; which contained at one of my visits, in September 1789, 41 prisoners, whose sentences were not determined; 185 criminals, 34 women, and 18 sick; in all 278. The chapel is in the centre of the building, from which four doors open into the opposite passages, which are dark and narrow, scarcely five feet wide. On each side are the rooms for the prisoners, with stoves and barrack-beds, but without bedding. One of the quarters is appropriated to women; another to criminals whose trials are not finished; another to petty offenders; and a fourth is used for an infirmary, and for prisoners of not the lowest rank. All the rooms have their windows towards the area and the surrounding wall, and apertures to the passages. There is a dark room for the unruly. No wine or spirits are permitted to be bought in the prison; but beer and any sort of bread.

The Infirmary consists of only one room for both sexes; but there were in it only 18 men, most of them miserable objects: several with fevers; no bedding, and little or no attention paid them; as some of the sick declared they had had nothing all day, and it was then five in the evening. Each of the quarters has a kitchen, which seemed of little use, as the prisoners chiefly subsist on charity; there being for this purpose several tin boxes placed on the outside of the prison, and a chest between the outer and inner gates. These are opened every Saturday, and the money divided among the prisoners.

In the exercise of this charity the Russians are not defective, as by the looks of the prisoners they seemed not in great want of necessaries. Hence I conclude, that the nation is humane; and in travelling through a great tract of the country, the peasants appeared to me of a kind and hospitable disposition.

New Government, or City Prison. To the court and rooms of this prison is a descent by a flight of many stone steps. There are two dirty and damp rooms, in which are confined both debtors and criminals, men and women, without any distinction, or any allowance. They lie on barrack-boards round the rooms, but without any bedding. The prisoners are miserable objects, who subsist on occasional charity. Such a prison is a disgrace to any civilized country. Here were about 80 prisoners; sometimes there are 150 in one of these rooms.

The Military Prison for deserters, consists of two rooms, each 20½ feet square. Round three sides of the room is a shelf, where part lie: no bedding: no regular allowance: they subsist chiefly on charitable contributions. On observing to the officer who attended me, that there were some old men among them, he said that there were some who had been away twelve years.

MOSCOW. CREMENTSCHUOK. 17

Grand Duke's Hospital. This having been burned down since I was at Moscow, I was desirous of seeing if any improvements had been made. It is built on the same spot, as few so near the city could be better, it having a fine open plain in front. It is on one floor, elevated a few steps from the garden. The rooms are lofty, and all of them have now an aperture in the ceiling, and the upper part of the windows open, which I found in few or no other hospital in Russia. The rooms were neat and clean: all the beds of blue linen, clean, and of a convenient size, (six feet two, by two feet ten) not crowded, but with room on each side for making them. I tasted the bread, milk, and beer, and found them good ; and indeed this small hospital would do credit to any country. Here were nineteen men and seven women; besides about the same number in the venereal wards, which are detached from the house; as are also, very properly, the kitchen and offices.

At the Military Hospital I found the bread very black, and neither well made nor baked. I shewed it to the Doctor, and then put the question to him, "Whether or no he thought the present alteration in the diet of the military and marine for the better?" But he was cautious, and did not choose to give me an answer. The purpose of this alteration is to fortify them, and render them able to endure hardships; but it should have been considered, that the prevalent disorders among those people are scurvy and putrid fevers. I had been twice over the four great wards of this hospital, before my visit to the first physician, and had found all the windows shut. When I went over them with him, he seemed surprized at what I told him, and ordered a proper number of windows to be opened; but, two hours after, all but one were shut again.

The Hospital for Deserters, in the midst of a court, in which were several sick rooms, was airy and fresh. The vents in the ceilings had, very properly, no closures. The Botanic Magazine, in the garden of the Military Hospital, had been rebuilt , upon the same good plan. It consists of three floors, and is twenty-eight feet wide in the inside. The upper floor has ten windows, two of which are at the ends, all of the same size, two feet and a half by fourteen inches: they have hinges, and are kept open in fine weather. The middle floor has twenty windows. The herbs are strewed on the floor in mats, or hung up on poles. The pleasant odoriferous smell of this place induced me to repeat my visits to it.

At Catherine's and Petrowitz Hospitals, I found in the ceilings of most of the rooms, one or more apertures for air, but every one stopt up, and every window shut, in some of the finest and mildest days. Thus the Russians accustom themselves to warmth and close air before the cold season comes on.

[Crementschuok.]

A new hospital for the recruits who fall sick on their march to the army, is erected about half a mile on the other side of the river Nieper, and adjoining to it. It is a wood building of one floor, raised three steps from the ground. There are six wards thirty-four feet and a half wide, having four rows of beds, about twenty-two in each row, on a barrack, separated only by a board eight or nine inches high: the walk between the rows only four feet.

Here were about four hundred sick; several very ill of the scurvy. I was informed, that at a little distance there were in the old hospital about one hundred very ill with the bloody-flux,

who were soon to be brought here. In the different wards I tasted the quas, and examined the bread: the latter very bad: the quas sour. Another drink is given to those who are worst, made of honey, water, vinegar, and pepper; to which brandy is added for the convalescents. They have a sort of water-gruel, which if not eaten one day, serves for the next: no milk, rice, or sage tea is allowed: the patients are tied to a certain diet, which the physician cannot alter. The rooms were quite clean at both my visits; but the apothecary's shop very offensive. From one half to one third of the patients in this hospital die; for if the intermittent fever continues upon them, I was informed it soon becomes the putrid fever, and carries off the young men. A bathing-house was erecting, which, from the dirtiness of the patients, seems much wanted; and is the more necessary, as the attendants on the sick in Russia are men, who have neither the cleanliness nor care of women.

[Cherson.]

The hospital is at the end of the town. The rooms near 24 feet wide and nine feet high. The beds are in rows against the wall; and in some rooms are one or two rows in the middle. The patients lie single. Bedsteads, beds, and coverlets very dirty: wards and passages never washed, nor beds changed when the patients die. At one of my visits they brought the Doctor some of the bread and quas that was to be served out, which he said was done every day; but I informed him, that neither the bread nor quas which I had seen and tasted at my former visit, were so good as these, and convinced him, that he had been imposed upon. He acquainted me, that there was linen in the wards for towels; but on desiring to see it, none was to be found. The sick were very dirty in their persons and linen: the rooms close and offensive: all disorders mingled together, except those with the itch, and last stage of the flux. The attendants are men sent from the regiments on account of their being useless from stupidity or drunkenness. Baths badly placed at the bottom of a steep descent from the hospital, and therefore seldom used. Here I saw four or five half-sick women, who were sentenced here for slight offences, to wash the hospital linen. The prevalent diseases are scurvy and intermittent fever. These disorders, from the closeness and dirtiness of the wards, scanty linen and bedding, improper diet, and bad attendance, soon turn to a putrid fever with flux, which carries off the patients in a few days. Here were a number of Swedish prisoners in the same room with the sick Russians from the fleet. This house was the pest-house, when the plague was in the town ten or twelve years ago. The primary objects in all hospitals seem here neglected, viz. cleanliness, air, diet, separation, and attention. These are such essentials, that humanity and good policy equally demand, that no expence should be spared to procure them. Care, in this respect, I am persuaded, would save many more lives than the parade of medicines in the adjoining apothecary's shop.

I visited the rooms for the sick soldiers of the regiment quartered here. Several were brought from the great hospital, having been there several months, and not cured; and if I may judge from appearances, those whom death spares will continue as long here; for the rooms are low, close, and offensive; many sick lie on mats upon barrack beds, with only

one blanket to cover them. In short, as in the great hospital, there are evident marks of far too little attention paid to the patients.

[Witowka.]

WITOWKA (now Bokoiaulenskoe) about 40 miles from Cherson. This place has been fixed on for an hospital for soldiers and recruits, as not far distant from Otschakow, and the new town of St. Nicholas. There are eight long lazaretts enclosed with reeds, situated near the river Bog, with the advantage of fine soft running water; but the country is destitute of wood for firing, as I saw not one tree for some hundreds of miles before I came to Cherson, nor betwixt Cherson and this place. The first sick were sent here in September 1788. The rooms are 27 feet wide, and contain each about 230 sick, who lie in two rows on barrack bedsteads, without any partitions, and so close, that within 30 feet, I have counted 16, 17, and even 18 sick. Beds dirty. Some had an old blanket, and all a stiff black woollen blanket, which covered three or four of them. The patients were dirty in their persons and linen; and, from their appearance and my enquiries, seemed sadly neglected. On asking the apothecary to shew me his bark, he referred to his boy, who, after searching for five minutes, brought me a pot containing near an ounce, which I should not have known to be that drug*. Provisions bad. No water for the patients to wash: no towels: the bath dirty beyond description. In short, every department of this hospital seems neglected and abused. When I saw so many brave fellows, who had fought so well for their country before Otschakow, suffered to perish here with filth, neglect, and vermin, how did my heart melt within me!

By a list of patients given me, it appears, that, from September 1788 to October 1789, there were admitted 11,319, discharged 7,639, dead 1,949. After my return to Cherson, I was not surprised to find, that 30 to 40 had died in a day at Witowka.

One afternoon, on observing about twenty poor objects standing together at the end of the town, I went to them, and found they were recruits just out of the hospital, who were waiting for orders to go to the new town about 16 wersts distance, on the road to which is neither house nor tree for shelter. The night was dreadfully wet, and they so weak and ill clothed, that I do not doubt but that several died on the road. A gentleman who accompanied me said, that, having occasion to go from Cherson to Witowka last winter, he himself had counted 24 persons lying dead on the road.

The troops were lodged in cells under ground (called Zimlankey) laid over with sticks and earth, having a hole at the top to let out the smoke. In this miserable condition do they pass the winter.

[St. Nicholas.]

About a mile from the new town of ST. NICHOLAS, which is just begun to be built, are four rooms erected for the sick, on account of the number of recruits and prisoners of war - who are compelled to work hard, and have no proper accommodation, and that

* Possibly these was a mistake here, and Mr. Howard's enquiry was misapprehended. Editor.

20 ST. NICHOLAS. CHERSON.

the Witowka hospital was full. I found here upwards of 300, extremely crowded upon barrack beds. Many of them were very ill. The quas very bad; the bread quite black and heavy: but the patients were that morning all shifted, and most had coverlets: the rooms were swept, and the surgeons in waiting, as the time had before been fixed for our visit, the brigadier Falajef going that day to view the works, who took with him the physician sent by prince Potemkin, and myself in his coach. I was afterwards urgent to see the remainder of the sick, having been well informed, that there were about 500. Upon this we returned to the town, and several officers, with the above-mentioned physician, accompanied me. Here I found about 50 such objects of wretchedness as I had never before seen together. Most or all of them were recruits in the prime of life; many dying, laid on hard coarse reeds: no linen: no coverlets: only a few remnants of their old clothes to cover them: their persons dirty beyond description: their shirts in rags. I turned to the officers, and requested them to look on their fellow-creatures, who were thus inhumanly treated, adding, "that in none of the countries I had ever visited, had I found far little attention paid to the military as in Russia. I knew what I said would have no other effect on them but to make them despise me, but I should assuredly relate what I had with so much concern and indignation beheld." These gentlemen, as I expected, soon left me. I then walked, and saw several recruits at their work, which was carrying sand on their backs to fill a mole. Many looked very sickly, and tottered under their burden. I proposed wheel-barrows, or light carts, with a horse or ox in each, which, as the ground was level, would expedite the work, and save the men, whose strength and spirits were broke before they got there by long marches.

Let but a contemplative mind reflect a moment upon the condition of these poor destitute wretches, forced from their homes and all their dearest connections, and compare them with those one has seen chearful, clean, and happy at a wedding, or village festival; let them be viewed quitting their birth-place, with all their little wardrobe, and their pockets stored with rubles, the gifts of their relations, who never expect to see them more; - now joining their corps in a long march of one or two thousand wersts; their money gone to the officer who conducts them, and defrauds them of the government allowance; arriving, fatigued and half naked in a distant dreary country, and exposed immediately to military hard-ships, with harassed bodies and dejected spirits; - and who can wonder that so many droop and die in a short time, without any apparent illness? The devastations I have seen made, by war among so many innocent people, and this in a country where there are such immense tracts of land unoccupied, are shocking to human nature!

On returning to CHERSON, on January 6th I went the round of all the wards of the Military Hospital and sick rooms of the regiment quartered here. As to the former, I found a great alteration with respect to cleanliness, in the persons, linen, and bedding of the sick. In the latter, some small alteration for the better in that particular, but not so general as in the Military Hospital. I am sorry to add, that in the former I saw many men's portions of meat not two ounces, and the grits for gruel very musty. I also observed one or two of

CHERSON. 21

the persons attending the sick intoxicated. One had a bottle of brandy that held two quarts, who, I fear, sells it out to the sick, which must defeat the best-concerted means for recovery. How many patients do I see in many disorders, which, I am persuaded, proceed from the life of spirituous liquors! What strict care should be taken that the attendants do not bring any to sell in the hospital! Have I not seen unmixed spirits served round to sick and dying patients, by persons intoxicated themselves; when, to my great surprize, I was told, that the physician had ordered it as a treat to the patients! If my visits had any share in promoting this, I fear I killed half a dozen of them; or, at least, put them some days sooner out of their misery.*

* Here terminates Mr. Howard's Memorandum Book. As he died January 20th, after a fortnight's illness, he must have been taken ill about this time; and amid such scenes of infection and disease his health and life could not be a day secure. The latter part of his memorandums not being, according to his custom, fairly recopied, has been difficult to make out, and many things just noted down in imperfect hints, could not be completed. It is somewhat remarkable, that a few pages before the end, he has written the following passage: "I am a stranger and pilgrim here; but I trust, through grace, going to a land peopled with my fathers and my kindred, and the friends of my youth. And I trust my spirit will mingle with those pious dead, and be for ever with the Lord."
