INTRODUCTION.

IN my latest tours, I had with pain observed, that notwithstanding the regulations which had been made in our own country, and elsewhere, for preserving health in prisons and hospitals, yet that infectious diseases continued occasionally to arise and spread in them. I had also been led, by the view of several lazarettos in my travels, to consider how much all trading nations are exposed to that dreadful scourge of mankind which those structures are intended to prevent, and to reflect how very rude and imperfect our own police was with respect to this object. It likewise struck me, that

---

establiihments, effectual for the -prevention of the most infectious of all diseases, must afford many useful hints for guarding against the propagation of contagious distempers in general. These various considerations induced me, in the lait edition of 'The State of the Prisons, i3c. to exprd's a wilh, " that some future traveller would give us plans of the lazarettos at Leghorn, Ancona and other places.” At length I determinedl’to procure these plans, and acquire all the necessary information respecting them, myself: and towards the end of the year 1785, I went abroad for the purpose of visiting the principal lazarettos in France and Italy. To the physicians employed in them, I proposed a set of queries relpeding the nature and prevention of the plague; but their answers not affording satisfactory instrudion, I proceeded to Smyrna and Constantinople. For, although thejiibjeds of the Turkish empire be little enlightened by the modern improvements in arts and feienees, I conceived that from their intimate acquaintance with the disease in question, and from tire great difference between their customs and manners, and ours, some^practices might be found among them, and some information gained| not unworthy tL. notice of more polished nations. I also pleased myself with the idea, not only of learning, but of being able to communicate somewhat to the inhabitants of these difbnt regions, if they should have curiosity enough to inquire, ' and liberality to adopt the methods of treating and of preventing contagious diseases which had been found most successful among ourselves.

INTRODUCTION.

a

Such were my views. That merciful Providence which had hitherto preferred me, was pleased to extend its protection to me in this journey also.

One consequence of my inquiries has been a full conviction of the importance, to this country, of properly-constituted lazarettos; and this, too, for commercial reasons, of which,

I confess, I had before no idea. The circumstances from which I drew this conclufio will ' be found in their proper places in the narrative; for I shall in this publication, as I cud in my former ones, confine myself chiefly to the narration of facts. What attention these fads deserve, and what measures it may be adviseable to adopt in consequence of them, I leave to the determination of the proper judges.

Upon my return from the Levant, I was solicitous to know what improvements had been made in our prisons during my absence, and how far the numerous abufos and defeats which I had laid before the public had been redressed. Therefore, after visiting the London prisons and the Hulks, I went to Ireland, and, returning by way of Scotland, travelled oyer a great part of England.

It is not my intention to transoribe my whole journal, and minutely relate all I saw# When I first printed my review of prisons, a particular and explicit account seemed necessary, on a subject so new to the public, and where so many things wanted alteration. Many changes for the better have been made, and are still making, of which I shall gladly give the reader an account; and it will be my duty also to note what I have found still needing reformation. Of these two parts of my business, I beg it may be believed, that with, reluctance I censure, but commend with pleasure.

SECTION I.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE

PRINCIPAL LAZARETTOS IN EUROPE.

THE first Lazaretto I visited was at Marseilles. The Health-office, Le Bureau de Saute, is in the city at the end of the port. It has an outer room and two council chambers. In the outer room, the depositions of captains of ships are taken, who come in their boats to an iron grate. At two feet distance there is an iron lattice with a door, which is opened only by the servants of die intendants, or directors, who are here in waiting, in a blue livery trimmed with white lace. Here also fetters, or orders for supplies, from the captains who are performing quarantine in their ships, are received with a pair of iron tongs, and dipped in a bucket of vinegar (landing ready for that purpose. Over the book in which the depositions of the captains are inserted for public view, there is hung up an advertisement, to desire that the leaves may not be torn, and if they be torn, that information may be given to die office. In this room were hung up also orders, that when captains are examined, none but those who belong to the office shall be present; and that captains of merchant-ships, who have no bills of health, shall be obliged themi'elves to perform quarantine in the lazaretto.

In the first of the two council chambers, there were hung up a plan of the lazaretto, and the picture of a person dying of die plague; also the names of the directors, and die weeks of their attendance. Two or more of diem are present every day to take the depositions of the captains as they arrive, to’ die guards and porters, and for the other business of this exteniive lazaretto.

The lazaretto is on an elevated rock near the city, at the end of the bay, fronting die south-west, and commands the entrance of the harbour. It is very spacious, and its

situation renders it very commodious for the great trade which the French carry on in the Levant. Among other apartments for palTengers, there are twenty-four large rooms, of which some are above flairs, and open into a spacious gallery enclosed by lattice. In these rooms ,are closets for beds, which the passengers and guards are required to bring with them. The guards are sent by the Health-office, and their number- is regulated by the number of passengers of each ship who perform quarantine. A number of pafl-fengers, not exceeding three, are allowed one guard, die expense of whom (namely twenty feus per day and his victuals) diey are obliged to bear. A passenger, therefore, who has

no companion, has no assistance in bearing this expense. To four, five, or fix paf-fcngers, two guards are assigned j and to seven, three guards. These guards perform the offices of servants; and will cook for passengers,- if they do not choose to have their victuals from the tavern. '

Within the lazaretto, is the governor’s house; and a chapel, in which divine service is. regularly performed; as also a tavern, from which persons under quarantine may have their dinners and suppers sent them, and which has likewise the exclusive privilege of supplying them with wine. Two days before the quarantine is finished, the bills are sent in, which being paid to die cashier, they receive a clean patent.

The quarantine of passengers who come with a foul bill, or in one of the two first ships from the same place with a clean bill, is thirty-one days, including die day they go out. If any account arrive of the plague having broke out in the place from which they came with a clean bill, after they left it, they are allowed no advantage from their clean bill; for, in this case, they must be confined fifteen days, and also fumigated f before they come down flairs, and are permitted to go to tli In case any of the company to

which diey belong die, their quarantine recommences.

The par loirs are long galleries with feats in them, situated between die gates, and separated

by wooden balustrades and wire lattice, beyond which there are other balustrades, distant about ten feet, at which the persons in quarantine may fee and converse with such friends as may choose to visit them. The wires are intended to prevent any thing from befog handed to them, or from them. And that nothing may be thrown over, and no escapes be made, there is a double wall round the lazaretto.

At the gate there is a bell to call any person in this enclosure; and by the number and other modifications of the strokes, every individual knows when he is called.

The ships are moored at the isle of Pomeque, where a governor resides, and other officers, to keep the crews of ships in order, and prevent diem from having any communi-

cation. * From thence, goods are conveyed to the lazaretto in large boats kept for Mar-

that purpose. Cottons with a foul bill must remain on deck six days; and the next SLaza-

six days, the first bales must remain on the bridge in the lazaretto, before any others RETT0,

can be received by the porters; f after this, the cargo of that ship is brought in. But if the ship have a clean bill, it is unloaded much quicker, and subject only to twenty days quarantine: unless it be one of the two first ships, or there have been an account that the plague had broke out after it had failed from the port where it was loaded, in which case, it is obliged to perform quarantine as before said of passengers. And if die plague be in other cities of the Levant, five days are added to the twenty days of the quarantine; this the French copied de mouche. The bales of cotton are exposed to the open air j and

every ten days, a seam of the bags is opened. Precious goods are placed in warehouses with open balustrades for the air to pals freely. J

At Genoa, the lazaretto is situated on die sea shore, near the city, and detached from Genoa

other buildings. The plan is regular; the centre-row equally dividing the areas, which are retto".

three hundred and ten feet by twenty-five. In the middle of one of the areas there is a litde chapel, which has three fides open, that the elevation of the host may be seen in the opposite rooms.

At the entrance there is a guard-room for ten soldiers, and a spacious bake-house.

Towards the areas are many vaulted rooms for passengers, which open into a corridor, where there are doors to separate the passengers of different ships. These rooms are

* Sometimes the governor is obliged to fend some of the French sailors to the prison in the lazaretto, because; having no pay during their quarantine, they are often quarrelsome.

f The porters are, in like manner with the guards, sent by the office, as [hips arrive- Their number is proportioned to the cargo j and four are allowed to a common ship.

J The French in every ship have a secretary, who always performs his quarantine on shore, and fees that none of the effects of different persons are mixed or embezzled by the porters. He sometimes acts as doctor, and is otherwise useful on board. Such a secretary I also found in a ship.

The adraiffion of persons to visit the lazaretto at Marfeillcs is ftnitly prohibited: but I have the pleasure of giv ing the first engraved plan of it. See plate I. The scale is of French feet. And as I shall have occasion ir» other plans to mention the feet of different countries, I here give their proportions.

fifteen feet and seven inches, by fourteen feet, three inches, and eleven feet and a half high. The corridor is ten feet and nine inches wide, and is separated from the areas by high wooden palisades. Above stairs there are thirty-six rooms in front, besides twelve belonging to the prior or governor. On one fide there are eleven, and on the other, ten rooms. All the rooms are nearly similar in length and breadth, about sixteen feet, nine inches, by fourteen feet, nine, and eleven feet, fix inches high; with two opposite windows, about four feet by three, and fix feet above the floor. The windows of all the rooms are too small. The floors are brick, and the roofs vaulted. Each room has in one comer, a chimney, and in another, a fewer shut in like a closet. These rooms open into a corridor eleven feet wide, which has spacious windows towards the areas, and doors which can shut up three or four rooms according to the number of passengers from each ship. All the windows have iron bars and shutters, but none are glazed. Adjoining to the back of the governor’s apartments is a neat and convenient chapel. When a considerable number are confined by sickness, the chaplain resides in the governor’s apartments j and then the physician and surgeon are also obliged to reside in their rooms, at the corner of one of the areas.

On the second floor there are ranges of warehouses. These are too narrow, being only sixteen feet and a half wide j and the windows are too small, being, on one fide, only two feet square j and on the odier, three feet, by two feet, nine inches. The floors are of stone j but such floors are improper; white bricks, well burnt, being best for goods, because less apt to become damp. To these warehouses there are spacious brick ascents on die outside, on which bales of cotton are opened and aired. The doors are Angle j but large folding doors would have been better; and there should have been a small partition in each of die warehouses, that the porters might pass with less danger of infection. The Hair-cases in the inside leading to these warehouses, and to diofe on die first floor, are like-wife too narrow, being only three feet and a half wide.

In the centre, behind the chapel, there are two spacious rooms, one hundred and twenty-five feet, by twenty-five. The afeent for bales is good, being ten feet wide; but die door way is only four feet wide. These would make good rooms for the sick; being frefii and aiiy, and having each twenty windows, with shutters to them, and without glass.

There are in the front three towers, or elevated rooms. That in the middle is called the governor’s, becaul'e it adjoins to his apartments. From the windows he has a fiill view of both the areas and corridors. But this lazaretto derives a peculiar advantage from a fine spring of water which comes from the mountains, and contributes much to its falutarinefs. The channel is full fix feet wide at its entrance into the area, and this renders it very convenient for walking linen. Being also property eujitluCled iluough all the sewers, it prevents the rooms from being oft’enfive.

There are three prilon-rooms, intended for riotous sailors who may be sent from the quarantine ships, and for die guards and porters, should they happen to be disorderly.

or guilty of embezzlement. The chief punishment is solitary confinementj and these Genoa. looms are not ill foited to this purpose. * See plates II. III. j-

Another lazaretto, belonging to the Genoese, is situated on a riling ground at Varignano, Spezia near the gulf or noble port of Spezia. Here ships ride safe in fourteen feet of water, and have every convenience for landing their cargoes. Having been minute in my account of the lazaretto at Genoa, I will give no description of this. The plan and views of it will give sufficient information concerning it. J See platIV. V. VI.

At Leghorn there are three lazarettos. One of them is new. I was there in 1778, Leghorn and saw forty-seven (laves employed in building it. || Ships which have the plague on *^ttos. board are now received here, and not chafed away or burnt, as is practised in too many places. The greatest attention is given both to the health and convenience of the pafien-gers, and the merchandifo is kept in the exadteft order. This lazaretto is called San Leopoldo, in compliment to the present Grand Duke; and at the upper end of one of the courts is placed his statue. The repeated visits I have paid to his prisons, hospitals, &c-have given me the foiled conviction that he is the true father and friend of Iris country.:

The very worthy governor of the city, Federigo Barlolani, did me the favour to accompany me to this new lazaretto, and to that of San Rocco. He also favoured me with the plans of the three lazarettos (two of which I have copied, plates VII. VIII.) and with the regulations, &c. which He published in quarto 1785, entitled Ordini di Sanita. The Grand Duke, before the publication of these regulations, had sent a person to the Levant, on purpose to gain information by returning from thence and performing quarantine at Marseilles, and there making the moll careful observations. Our ambassador at Con-ftantinople. Sir Robert Ainjlie, § told me, that the lazarettos at Leghorn are the best in Europe. This was confirmed to me by two gentlemen who had performed quarantine both there, and at Marseilles.

* This lazaretto has a double wall like that at Marfeillts. Between the walls there is a burying-ground for Protestants, but no tomb-stones or inscriptions are allowed. Here our late consul Mr. Halford was interred.

And while I was at Genoa, a Scotch Tailor died in the great hospital, who continuing to the lad Heady in hit religious principles, was buried here.

Adjoining to this lazaretto there is a spacious garden which formerly belonged to it, but was f6ld by the magistrates on the condition, that if any epidemical licknefs should happen to prevail in the city, and the ground be wanted for tents, &c. it fha.ll be returned to the lazaretto.

+ This pi ah: and the remaining ones referred to in this pagj, as they could not all be conveniently infer ted here, will be found a: the end of me book.

The greatdt care is taken to destroy infection should there be any. Ships with foul bills are required to perform quarantine eighty days: but at die end of forty days they may change dieir station, and the captains are allowed to come on lliore. The different kinds of goods are separated, and placed in proper order under cover. The cottons arc taken out of the bags containing them, and placed in rows of piles, upon boards laid on stone pillars about eighteen inches from the floors; and in repacking they are flung over a man who gets into the bags, in order to tread down the cotton; the consequencC of which muff be exposing him to great danger should any infcdion remain. This, though the surest: way of expelling infection from cotton, is not the moll agreeable to merchants, not only because more expensive, but also for die following reason. The bales of cotton, in conveying them on camels to the sea-ports, are often taken off on the ' roads, and laid in wet and dirty places where their outsides are injured. In consequence of being taken to pieces and repacked in the lazaretto in the manner now described, the injured parts get among the inner parts, and the cotton acquires die appearance of being wholly damaged; and, dierefore, is rendered less marketable.—Thefe are observations which three large English ships performing quarantine while I was here gave me an opportunity of making.

The health-office at Zante is in the city at the water fide. In this office the depofi-tions are taken from the captains they arrive.. If they come from the Levant, or from the Barbary cooft, perform-forty-two days quarantine; if from the Morea, only

twenty-one days; if from any other part, they and the passengers are generally permitted to pais through the office into the city, as I did when I arrived here from Malta. Three gentlemen in this office give daily attendance for one year without salary or emolument.

The old lazaretto * is distant about half a mile from the city, and fttuated on a rising ground near the sea. The merchandise is brought hither in a large boat belonging to the office, and rowed by the crew of the ship under quarantine; a smaller boat of the office attending at some distance. The entrance is by a covered gate-way ten feet wide, and convenient for the admission < i packages. On one fide there is a room for the guard consisting of a corporal and four soldiers, on the other, a room for the fub-prior. The prior himself resides in the looms over the gate-way, and is appointed by the diretftors of the health-office at Venice.

Between the outer and inner-gate one of the guards at night commands the middle court, the gate into it being palifaded. This court is about one hundred and thirty feet long and thirty-five wide. The doors of the other courts (three on each fide) open into this. On one fide they are chiefly designed for passengers, and in each there are four

• There is another called the neiv lazaretto, which is appropriated to a numerous body of peasants, who pals over to the Morea to work in harvell time: on their return they perform here a seven days quarantine; and at this time, other persons from the Morea perform only fourteen days quarantine in the old lazaretto.

At the farther end there is a linall paved court, a little elevated above the other courts. On one fide of it, there is a neat enclosed garden belonging to Roman Catholic friars, who have a convent at a little diflancefiand on the other fide, a chapel in which three of the friars officiate; and also a Greek chapel. — I am the more particular in the descriprion of this lazaretto, as its situation and general plan struck me as affording some good ideas for the construttion of a house of correction.

Corfv. The lazaretto at Corfu is finely situated on a rock surrounded with water, about a

Castel- league from die city. The lazaretto of Castel-Novo in Dalmatia is on the shore about N°v°. tWQ miies from the city. At the back of it there is a delightful hill, which belongs to a convent of friars. Persons in quarantine, after a few days are allowed to walk there,

. and divert themselves with shooting, &c. But, being in a ship with a foul bill, I could not lee either of these lazarettos. Their officers are dependent on the health-office at Venice, and their regulations are similar.

After visiting the lazarettos now described, I failed to Smyrna, and from thence to Constantinople. Here I had once intended to travel by land to Vienna. This is a journey capable of being easily performed in twenty-four days, no quarantine being now required to be performed at Semlin, the place on the confines of Hfnr EurpcrOr's Hungarian dominions, where formerly travellers used to be, detained for this purpose. But on farther consideration I determined to seek an opportunity of performing quarantine myself; and with this view to submit to the inconveniences of a sea-voyage to Venice, the place where lazarettos were first established. And, in order to obtain the best information by performing the strictest quarantine, I farther determined to return to Smyrna, and there to take my passage in a ship with a foul bill. Contrary winds and other causes made this a tedious and dangerous voyage, and it was sixty days from the time of leaving Smyrna before I arrived at Venice.

Venice. Here, after our ship had been conducted by a pilot-boat to her proper moorings, a messenger came from the health-office for the captain; and I went with him in his boat to fee the manner in which his report was made, his letters delivered, and his examination conducted. The following morning a messenger came in a gondola to conduct me to the new lazaretto. I was placed, with my baggage, in a boat fafrened by a cord ten feet long to another boat in which were fix rowers. When I came near the landing-place, the cord was loosed, and my boat was pushed with a pole to the shore, where a person met me, who said he had been ordered by the magistrates to be my guard.

unloading the boat, the fub-prior came and shewed me my lodging,’ which was & very Venice. dirty room, full of vermin, and without table, chair, or bed. That day and the next morning I employed a person to wash my room: but this did not remove the offenfivenefs of it, or prevent that constant head-ach which I had been used to feel in visiting other lazarettos, andfome of the hospitals in Turkey. This lazaretto is chiefly assigned to Turks and soldiers, and the crews of those ships which have the plague on board. In one of the enclosures was the crew of a Ragufian ship, which had arrived a few days before me, after being driven from Ancona and Trieste. My guard sent a report of my health to the office, and on the representation of our consul, I was conduced to the old lazaretto which is nearer the city. Having brought a letter to the prior from the Venetian am-baflador at Constantinople, I hoped now to have had a comfortable lodging. But I was not so happy. The apartment appointed me (confxfting of an upper and a lower room) was <■ no less disagreeable and offensive than the former. I preferred lying in the lower room on a brick floor where I was almost surrounded with water. After six days, however, the prior removed me to an apartment in some respects better, and confxfting of four rooms. Here I had a pleasant view; but the rooms were without furniture, very dirty, and no less offensive than the sick wards of the worst hospital. The walls of my chamber, not having been cleaned probably for half a century, were saturated with infection.

I got them washed repeatedly with boiling water, to remove the offensive frnell, but without any eflfcCl. My appetite failed, and I concluded I was in danger of the flow hospital-fever. I proposed white-washing my room with lime flacked in boiling water, but was opposed by strong prejudices. I got, however, this dorte one morning through the assistance of the British consul, who was so good as to supply me with a quarter of a bushel of fresh lime for the purpose. And the consequence was, that my room was immediately rendered so sweet and fresh, that I was able to drink tea in it in the afternoon, and to lie in it the following night*. On the next day the walls were dry as well as sweet, and in a few days I recovered my appetite. Thus, at a small expense, and to the admiration of the other inhabitants of this lazaretto, I provided for myself and successors, an agreeable and wholesome room, instead of a nasty and contagious one.

Over the gate-ways of two large rooms or warehouses, were carved in stone the images of three faints, (San SebaJUano, San Marco, and San reckoned the patrons of this

This I mention, because in the following March on complaining to the under-sheriffs in Newgate of their inattention to the clause which orders this in the Act of Parliament for securing the health of prisoners, their excuse was, that they were afraid of dampness, which seemed to me as reasonable as it would be not to allow towels for those whose feet, hands and face are dirty, left by waiting them they should catch cold.

were put into one of these rooms_ for forty days, and afterwards into the other for the lame time, before they were discharged*.

The Rules and Tariffs of the other lazarettos in Europe having been evidendy formed from those established at Venice, I shall be more particular in my account of the regulations here for performing quarantine.

■ The following account has been, for the most part, copied from the /ketch of an information sent to our government in 1770, the perusal of which I owe to the favour of Mr. Richie our consul at Venice. I carefully examined this sketch during my quarantine of forty-two days, and I have here given it with a few corrections and observations.

• The health-office at Venice was instituted by decree of the senate in the year 144?, in the midst of a very destruftive pestilence, and afterwards confirmed and regulated by1 various subsequent decrees, till reduced to the excellent order in which it stands at present. This important office is governed by three commissioners, annually chosen by the senate, whose duty it is to attend every day to the business of the office; and to them are added1 two assistant commissioners, and two extraordinary, who have formerly served as junior commissioners, or are gentlemen of wisdom and experience: these last take their feats at the board when they think it requisite, or when cases of difficulty and danger require their counsel. The power or authority of this court is very extensive; for, when all the leven magistrates fit together, their judgments are decisive and without appeal, as well in civil as criminal affairs that relate Tcr puBIic health,-all which salt under "tneir cognizance; by which means this court is one of the most respectable in die government, and accordingly is always filled by persons of approved integrity and reputation, and in easy circumstances, in order to be less exposed to corruption, as their emoluments are very small, although it is a step towards more lucrative employments.—I shall not enter into an elaborate description of every particular circumstance relative to this office, only so far as is necessary to form an idea of its regulations and order in the expurgation of merchandise, or passengers coming from places fuspected of pestilential infection. I shall therefore first take notice of the office itself, the duty and authority of its magistrates, &c. and afterwards successively give a particular account of the lazarettos, priors of the lazarettosj guardians of health', -messengers, porters, the method of receiving captains of ffiips from fiifpeded parts, taking their reports, quarantine of passengers, and expurgation of goods in the lazaretto; taking notice occasionally of other circumstances of less moment, which have a relation to, or connexion with those above mentioned.

* Many of the windows in these rooms, and also in some other ancient pest-houses which I have seen, are now bricked up. This Ihews, that in the last century, physicians were sensible of the importance of fresh air, and a free circulation of it in sick wards. A different practice, particularly in the small-pox and the gaol-fever, was afterwards adopted by medical gentlemen; but we seem now to be returning to the ancient and more salutary practice. Formerly also, it seems probable that men did not entertain those absurd prejudices against the free use of water in washing themselves and their rooms, which are now prevalent; for, in several of the old pefl-houses,

I have observed the marks of a g^er/cr a«.:(/:on tc the -car, a of gaining plenty of water than has been thought nccefiary in many of the hospitals built within these fifty years.

The court is always attended by a lecretary, who is a notary public, advocate fiscal, Venice. and several clerks, who are for life or during good behaviour, and have their respective salaries.- The priors of the lazarettos are subjected to this board, as are the guardians of health, and me (Tenge rs, whose particular duties I shall afterwards describe. It maintains overseers in different parts of the city to inspect the provisions fold in the public markets, lhops or otherwise, who make their report of whatever they find that might have a tendency to affect the public health; their business is also to fu-perintend beggars, to prevent loathsome and noxious distempers being derived from want and misery, or other obvious causes; they keep an exact register of deaths, and the bodies of those who die without any previous malady, are accurately examined by the physician and surgeon immediately belonging to the office; both these have a fixed lalary, and are consulted by the board in cases relating to their respective professions; they are also obliged in contagious emergencies to (hut themselves up in the lazaretto to take care of the Tick *.

The city of Venice has two lazarettos appropriated to the expurgation of merchandise Lazaret-susceptible of infection, coming from fulpedted parts, and for the accommodation of paf- T0S* (engers in performing quarantine; as also for the reception of persons and effects infected in the unhappy times of pestilence. The old lazaretto is two miles, and the new about five miles dillant from the city, both on little ifiands, separated from all communication, sot only by broad canals surrounding rbem. but also by high walls; they are of large extent, being about four hundred geometrical paces in circumference. They have only a ground floor and one over it, and are divided and lubdivided into a great number of apartments, greater and smaller, for the reception of passengers; all these apartments have their separate entries and stairs, and every range of them has an open court in front, with plats of grass which is not suffered to grow too high, and no kind of trees or vegetables are permitted within this district, nor within a good distance from it. There are (heds against some of the walls, and in other proper places (but not mixed with the apartments of passengers) so contrived that the merchandise is not exposed to damage by rain or otherwise, and at tire fame time, that the air is not confined. A more minute description would be tedious, and as the plan of the old lazaretto may be seen (in plate XII.), is not necessary.

The internal government and direction of these lazarettos is committed in each to an Prior’s officer called a Prior,who^'Nffiofen by the board of health, and accountable to it alone for ®UTY*

He must fee all the gates and doors of the different apartments locked every evening by sun-set, as well the outward gates as those of the apartments occupied by passengers, merchandise, and porters; he takes the keys into his possession, and suffers them not to be opened before sun-rise. And where there is any suspicion of infection, the gates must be kept constantly locked, and opened only for necessary occurrences, in the presence of the prior.

He must not suffer dogs, cats or other domestic animals to go loose in the lazaretto.

He must neither buy nor fell, nor make bargains or contracts with passengers or others within the lazaretto, nor permit others to do foj neither are contracts of any kind, purchases or sales, nor even powers of attorney or other notorial acts allowed there, without express leave from the board j otherwise they are null and void.

He suffers no fishing boats, nor other small craft to come within a certain distance of the lazaretto, nor any communication between those in quarantine, and such boats.

He keeps a book wherein are regularly noted all persons who perform quarantine, together with a general inventory of their effects, and a particular distinct one of all goods and merchandise, copies of which he transmits to the health-office, at least once a month.

He cannot receive persons nor effects to perform auarantine without a-tnandaie foam the office, which mandate mutt be always accompanied by a messenger, and in the fame form at their discharge. Neither can he admit visitors to those in quarantine without such a mandate, which (for visits) is given gratis from the office *. But public brokers are excluded from these visits, even if they had obtained a mandate for that purpose.

He is to take care that quiet and good order be maintained among the passengers and porters, and must not permit gaming, drinking, nor even such exercises and diversions as might produce a mixture of persons in different quarantines, or offend the circumspection of the place.

When a passenger or porter falls sick, the prior by means of the respective guardian takes care that he is separated from others in the fame apartment as much as polfible, and immediately gives notice to the board, who fend their physic'^? to examine diligently the nature of the disease, and any other physician may be called j^itly with him j but they are not to transgress the cautions prescribed, or they would be detained in the fame apartment, till the quarantine ended. The prior is authorized to execute the office of notary public in cases of necessity, for no notary is admitted without express order from the board; he therefore may draw up wills and testaments of those within his territory, but it must be done in die presence of five witnesses. When any person dies there, unless the physician of the

There is a burial place within the lazaretto, and the dead are all buried naked, by those of their respective apartments, and if there is any suspicion of infection, a quantity of quick-lime is thrown upon the corpse in die grave, which is digged five or six feet deep.

It is the prior’s duty to fee that the guardians of the respective quarantines cause the paflen-gers to expose their apparel, and other effects to the open air every day, and that they give all proper assistance to those under their guard.

He ought to visit every apartment under quarantine at lead twice a day, once in the morning, and once after noon, to fee that the passengers are properly served and supplied with necessaries, and that every thing goes on according to the rules and cautions of health. He is to take into his possession all forts of arms belonging to passengers, which are to be restored when the quarantine is finished.

No Jutlers are admitted, but those appointed by the board, on purpose to supply the lazaretto with provisions and other necessaries > diefe are obliged to come every day, and to bring whatever the passengers order, at a fixed price j extortion is leverely punished j they are not to enter the lazaretto, but have a convenient place assigned them, where the guardians and passengers can come to fee their provisions, and to give their orders j the sutlers have balkets fattened 10 poles ot leven or «igbr feet long, in which they reach every thing to those within, and in presence of the prior or his substitute, who cause the money to be dipped in vinegar or salt water, before the sutlers take it.

The prior cannot be arrested, during his office, by any other magistrate but those of health, nor is subject to civil or criminal prosecution in any other court of justice: neither can persons or effects be arrested or attached in the lazaretto during quarantine. The prior is strictly enjoined not to exact money, or any other consideration whatever from the passengers, by way of recompense for his trouble or attendance, nor ought he even.

(according to the laws) to accept of presents from passengers who perform quarantine, or from merchants whose goods are under his inspection only he is entitled to a small recognition for every bale or parcel, as regulated by the magistrates. But he and his assistants expert a gratuity *.

The prior and his substitute must carefully avoid touching either goods or passengers in quarantine, and for that end, in their walks and visits always cany a cane to keep passengers at a proper distance; but if by an unfortunate accident they should be contaminated by touch, they must perform the quarantine from whence the suspicion of infection was derived, and others would be appointed in their room, pro tempore. If they were touched by malicious design, the person offending is liable to such punishment as the nature of die offence requires, and the magistrates of health judge adequate.

Neither the prior nor his substitute must leave the lazaretto, except when called by the magistrates, or upon business with them relative to his office; and not without express permission, on his private affairs f.

There are sixty guardians belonging to the health-office of Venice, of whom part are appointed to inspect the quarantines of passengers, merchandise, and the porters attending it in the lazaretto, and part superintend the quarantines of ffiips and their companies, on board which they are sent immediately on their arrival, and continue till their dischargej all these have a fixed daily allowance, from the passengers, mailers of ffiips or merchants in whose service they immr<list~iy O K. ir ,kity in the lazaretto is to

On the arrival of passengers he must fee all their trunks, chests, &c. opened, put his hands in every one of them, take a note of the general contents, and if he finds any thing contra-* band, the prior must acquaint the magistracy, who determine accordingly.

also are under the eye of the prior, and in cases of collusion or wilful neglect, they are Venice. punished severely and sometimes capitally*.

The duty of guardians on board ffiips is still more ftrid, and requires greater attention; Guardi-for, not having the prior to direct them in any emergency, as in the lazaretto, they mull correspond directly with the office, and give an account of every thing that happens immediately. On their going aboard, they must take an exact roll of all the ship’s crew, which they transmit to the office, and they must fee them all muttered every day, that no sickness be concealed, nor elopement made.. They must also take a distinct and minute note of all goods and effects on board without exception, a copy of which they also transmit to the office, in order to prevent contraband goods being clandestinely retained.

After this they must on no consideration allow any thing to go out of the ftiip, nor must they suffer any bark or other vessel to come near without a mandate; and when visits are permitted to the captain or crew, the guardian must always be in fight of the interview, that the due cautions of health be carefully observed. They are to take care that the sutlers appointed to serve ships in quarantine, perform their duty faithfully, and with due regard to the rules of health, in like manner as in the lazaretto. They are to permit no paflen-gers to perform quarantine on board the ship, under any pretence whatever; and if any should remain on board in sailors’ disguise, he or they must be sent to the lazaretto, and the ship begins her quarantine anew from the day after their departure; which happens in the same manner if goods should be concealed on board, after the rest of the cargo is lent to the lazaretto.

Mejfengersor servants are employed by the magistrates of the health-office to conduct Messen-all captains of ships to the office, to make their report, and back again on board, the cap- OER*‘ tains going in their own boat, and the messengers in theirs; they must also attend all passengers to the lazaretto, as well as every lighter of merchandise sent thither, and fee the boat’s crew return on board again, without communication with others. They are obliged also (or rather the eldest of them) to receive, open, and perfume, or smoke, all letters that come by ships from suspedted parts; and all captains, sailors or passengers, are ftriClly prohibited from keeping letters on board, or fending them ashore without this requisite formality at the health-office: they are afterwards sealed again, and distributed according to their directions. These messengers or servants (in number seven) are also employed in general, on all mefiages from the office, whether to the lazaretto, or vessels in quarantine, or on business relating to the department of health in the city. They have no fixed salary, but are paid so much for conducting captains of ships, passengers t, or merchandise.

* Several of these guardians are old and infirm, and of no use in waiting on passengers. The daily pay of each is three lira and a half, as engraved on a stone in the lazaretto. But my guardian was very cross till I made him an extra-allowance of a sequin a week for provisions.

the day I came out was sixty lircs and a half. Finding that he expected a gratuity, I gave him a feouin over and above his demand.

Porters.

AH porters employed in purging goods in the lazaretto, are immediately under the inspe<5tion and jurisdiction of the magistrates of health, lo long as they remain there, being superintended by the prior and guardians, and if found deficient in doing their duty, are punished according to the rigour of the law, as indeed all other delinquents are in matters of health. Every merchant must have his own porters; but their names must be given into the office, and approbation obtained; neither is it permitted to agree with them by the lump, but they mull have their settled daily wages; the number of porters must also be proportioned to the number of bales or large parcels, and for every forty bales or large parcels, there must be a porter.

: Of receiving Captains of Ships from suspected Parts, and taking their Report.

It is here proper to premise, that all ships are received at Venice, even those which are known to have the plague on board; the rules of health are very exactly attended to in every circumstance; in this they are naturally somewhat more ftri£t, but for the rest do not deviate from the established course. It is all'o requisite to observe, that all ships and merchandise coming from any part of the Ottoman dominions, are indispensably subjedted to the full quarantine of forty days; for, as the Turks take no precautions to prevent this dreadful calamity, or to preserve or deliver themselves from it; the Venetians very justly conclude that it is precarious and highly dangerous to trust to any certificates of health whatever, whether from their own consuls or others, in places where, although the contagion do not openly appear, it mny lurking In bales of merchantllle transported from other parts. Besides, ships from Zante, Cephalonia, and. the other Venetian islands are always liable to a quarantine of thirty days, or three weeks at least, and frequently to forty days; because, lying so near the Morea, and having daily communication with its inhabitants, they often neglect the strict rules of health, or connive at the breach of them, though all of them have an office; on which communication they principally depend for their subsistence, the produce of these islands not being sufficient for a third part of their inhabitants. To prevent therefore the fatal consequences that such negligence might produce, it is an established rule, to treat all ships and merchandise on their arrival at Venice from these suspe<5ted places,; with the fame caution and reserve, as if they were actually infeifted; and to obviate all danger before their arrival, the pilots are strictly charged, on capital penalty, not to go on board any ship from Turkey, or the adjacent islands, nor to mix with the people; nay, even no pilot is permitted to go on board any ship whatever till cleared at the health-office, or if necessity requires it, they are not to return to dieir own boats, but to remain on board, till the ship is declared free at the health-office; and in case of performing quarantine, the pilot must do the fame. They are also ftrifbly ordered to use none but tarred ropes, and if the ship they attend comes from suspetted parts, they are to put the captain in mind to hoist the usual signal of such ships, diat no other boats or vessels may inadvertently hold intercourle with them. When therefore the ship enters the port, or as soon as the above-mentioned signal is discovered, (and the health-office keeps a person on purpose to give notice of the approach of these and all other ships) a guardian is dispatched on board, whose office and duty com-

mences from that moment, and continues till the ship. has performed quarantine: besides, Venice. in dangerous cases, as soon as the ship comes to anchor in the situation appointed, a bark with a party of soldiers is sent to lie at a proper distance, and to observe that nothing is done against the eftahliffied laws. Then one of die messengers goes to conduit the captain to the health-office; his hoat keeps a proper distance before that of the captain, clears the way, and takes care that no communication is held between diofe in die suspeited boat and others. When they arrive at the landing place of the office, which is so contrived that the captain and people may talk with diofe on ftiore without approaching too near, he is forthwith conduced imo an encloled entry for that purpose, adjoining to the office, where his report is taken by a clerk, from a window at due distance; the usual questions Questions are asked, such as, from whence he comes; when he left his port; whether he has a clean bill Captains. of health or not; what kind of voyage he has made; if he touched intermediate ports; if he had product in them, or not; if he met vessels at sea; and of what nation; if he were aboard of them, or they of him; how many hands he has on board, and if any passengers ^ if they have been all the voyage in health, or if any be dead, or Tick; what his loading con-fists of; if he took it in all in one port: this report is written down by the clerk, and then all his papers and letters are demanded. The first papers to be examined (after previous fumigation) is the bill of health, which is compared with the report given in by the captain, both in regard to the health of the place from whence he came, and to the number of seamen and passengers on hoards and if any captain present himself without a bill of health, it is the unalterable rule of the office, to oblige ship and cargo to perform ful) quarantine. If there should be any difference between the bills of health, and the captain’s report, in the number of persons on board, it is very strictly examined into, and the ship although coming from a place without the least suspicion of infection, is kept in reserve till the matter is sufficiently cleared up; and if any malicious intention be discovered in the captain to deceive the magistracy, by giving false reports, it is a capital crime, and punished accordingly; for if the number on board be greater than that in the bills of health, there is ground to fulped that the supernumerary person or persons have been taken from on board another ship, or from some place, without die requisite documents of health: and if the number be less, it might have been diminished by some contagious disease; but supposing these points satisfactory, all ships with clean bills of health are at liberty to unload directly after the captain’s report, and he may return on board, without the meffen-ger. But when the ship is from any part of the Turkish dominions, or other suspetted parts, the captain is re-condu<sted on board with the fame formality as he came. The guardian being already on board, begins immediately on the captain’s return to exercise his office, by taking an exatt roll of all the crew, and a particular note of their clothes and other effects, bodi which he transmits to the office, to be compared with the captain’s report; and when permission is given to unload, he keeps ah exact register of every parcel that goes out of the ship, which he transmits to the office, in order to be compared with the captain’s manifesto delivered in writing on making his report.

Quarantine of Passengers.

When there are passengers on board, as soon as the above formalities are over, a man* date is font from the office, to remove them to the lazaretto, where they usually go in the ship’s boat, the messenger always keeping near them in his; when they arrive at the lazaretto, the messenger consigns them to the prior, and conducts the ship’s boat back again. The passengers find their guardian of health at the lazaretto before them; their apartment is assigned, their clothes and other effects for use are visited, and noted; and they begin to count their quarantine from the day after their arrival at the lazaretto, with the precautions and regulations already described.

Unloading Merchandise, and removing it to the Lazaretto.

All goods and effects susceptible of infection from suspedted parts, must go to the lazaretto to perform quarantine, none being permitted to remain in the ship; but such. as are not susceptible, and in bulk may be unloaded on the ship’s arrival, after obtaining a mandate, and in presence of a messenger, who must be always within fight, as well as the ship’s guardian on board. Great caution is used in transporting merchandise to the lazaretto; the lighters must have no fails, or the prior detains them along with the goods; the ropes are well tarred; the sailors belonging to the ship load them, and take them in tow with their own boats to the lazaretto, always accompanied by a messenger in going and coming. The prior receives them, as before observed, delivers them to the care of the porters and. guardians, and They are accountable. One of the ship-mates or fearrien remains in the lazaretto for further guard to the goods, and to be answerable for the bills of lading, performing his quarantine there. When the whole cargo is unloaded, and properly disposed and ranged in the lazaretto, the quarantine of both ship and goods commences, and not before.

ExpuRCATiON of Goods in the Lazaretto.

Goods for expurgation are ranged under sheds for that purpose in the lazaretto, in different order, according to the kinds and marks of the parcels, so that no confusion infues in distinguishing the respective properties.

. Wool is taken entirely out of the bags or bales, and ranged in heaps, not above four

feet h:gh, these are all moved twice every day, turned, and the heaps mixed by the porters with their hands and arms bare, during forty days lucceflively, and every five days are besides the usual labour, moved out of the places they were in.

Silky flax, feathers, and such like, are managed in die same manner.

Cotton wool and yarn, camel’s hair and beaver in bags, are purged in a different way. The bags are all unripped at one end, and the porters are obliged every day, to thrust their naked hands and arms into them, in different places, as far as the middle of the bag, i for twenty days succeslivelyj then die bags are sewed up, turned over, and die other end unripped, and managed in the same manner the twenty subsequent days, which complete the quarantine; but neither Qf the days wherein the bags are opened, are reckoned among the forty.

Sect. I.

LAZARETTOS.

tr

Woollen and linen cloths, and all goods that are folded in pieces, are unloosed, and the porters turn diem over fold by fold, thrusting their naked arms between the folds, and shifting them often, under and above. When there is a certainty of infection, besides this daily motion, they are unfolded, and extended on cords to the open air, as often as the weather permits. Carpets, blankets, bed covers, quilts, and other manufactures of wool and silk, flax, books, vellum, and all kinds of paper, hair bags, and such like, are continually exposed to the air, moved and turned two or three times a day.

Furs are among the most dangerous articles, and very carefully purged, kept constantly exposed to the air, and very often moved and shaken; in like manner hair, and ostrich feathers are very diligently attended to.

‘Tobacco, cordouans, Iheep and goats skins, dressed, and all other dry dressed skins, are ranged in heaps, and now and then moved; but being articles leis subject to infection they are usually liberated in twenty days.

Bees wax and lponges, are purged by putting them in salt water (not stagnated) for forty-eight hours, and then they are free. There is a place formed in the lazaretto for this purpose, and a guardian to superintend the operation.

Wax and tallow candles are subject to full quarantine, on account of the cotton in them, but if the proprietor submits to let them be immerged as above, they are free. Animals with wool or long hair, are liable to the whole quarantine; but those with short straight hair are purged by causing them to swim afliuic. The feathered animals are purged by repeated sprinkling with vinegar till well wet.

There are other articles not susceptible of infection, and of consequence not liable to quarantine, though sometimes they become liable by attendant circumstances, such as salted hides, which when sufficiently salted and moist, are free; but if dry, they must undergo the formalities of quarantine.

Afpher is in itself free, and may be landed, but its being wrapt or packed up in susceptible matter, subjects it to quarantine; and in like manner, other free articles which cannot be separated from their package, or if the proprietors do not choose they should be, are liable to the cautions of the lazaretto.

Many articles are always free, when they come in the lump, and others though in package, either because the package itself is free, or purified by the volatile qualities of the contents, or can be removed or rendered harmless. Of the first fort, are all kinds of grain, Vallonia or bark, salt, flax seed, and in general all feeds, marble, minerals, wood, earths, sand, allum, vitriol, elephants’ teeth, &c. Of the second fort are sugars, cheese, butter, pig. noli, fruits fresh and dried, all salted and smoked meat, &c. Bottorghi, drugs, colours, and such like, that can be separated from the packages. Of the third fort, are liquors of all kinds, brandies, oils, wines, after pitching the bungs, left there.should be canvass or any thing of that nature in them, currants, raisins and pitch, alth6u|h in canvass packages, are free, because it is supposed their nature, or the effluvia proceeding from them prevent contagion, only the seams and corners are tarred.

Molita.

The Venetians were formerly one of the first commercial nations in Europe, and the regulations for performing quarantine in their lazarettos are -wife and good-, but now, in almost every department into which I had opportunity to look, there is such remiflhefs and corruption in executing these regulations, as to render the quarantine ahnoft useless, and little more than an establishment for providing for officers and infirm people.

In coming from Smyrna in a Venetian ship with a foul bill, we first anchored at Modon in the Morea, for water. Here a Turkiffi officer came on board, and attended us till we were out of the port, to fee that this alone was our object *. Afterwards we anchored at Zante, where i'ome passengers disembarked, and we were detained a day or two extraordinary, that the captain might retail coffee, &c. to the inhabitants.. We next anchored at an island north of Corfu, where the captain and passengers went ashore, and the inhabitants came on board to traffic for quilts, &c. Opposite Castel-Novo, at about two miles distance is the health-office, where all ships that come from the Levant into that port are obliged to anchor. Here the owner of the ship lived; and the captain and passengers went almost every day into the city; and employing themselves in unloading and loading goods day and night, caused a delay of eight days. The mate openly in the day time took goods to his friends in the country, and continued with them till the next day. A Ragufian ship also, and others which anchored here with clean bills, freely associated and traded with us. I observed that a half naked man (a soldier) came to us in a boat rowed by a boy, twice a day, and that he received biscuits and ho£_vii5:“»l«- I imagined that he came for cha-

rity; but soon learnt that he was the guard for our ship, appointed by the officer who resided at the health-office. At the isle of Molita, near the coast of Dalmatia we anchored again, and the captain and two of the passengers went directly ashore. Three days were spent here in trading with the inhabitants, and the opportunity of a fine wind was loft, to gratify the avarice of the captain.

Such occurrences convinced me of the justnefs of a remark, which was made by a Greek merchant who had considerable property on board this ship; that all captains and crews of Levant ships should be strictly prohibited from trading in their voyages. In consequence of this practice, the goods are often detained so long as to lose a market; and the passengers and crews are exposed to more danger, should there be any infection in the ship. But above all; it exposes the inhabitants of the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean to perpetual danger of the importation of the plague. This was dreadfully verified in Dalmatia a few years ago; and I was informed that lately, in a hamlet belonging to the Ragufian state, all the inhabitants died of the plague thus imported, except two or three, who were themselves shot, by the order of the magistrates to die surrounding guard.

• A few dnys after leaving Modon, we had a smart skirmish with a Tunifian privateer. In this ftirmilh one of our cannon charged with spike-nails, &c. having accidentally done great execution, the privateer immediately, to our great joy, hoisted its fails and made off. This interposition of Providence saved us from a dreadful fate; for I understood afterwards, that our captain, expedling that either our immediate death, or perpetual slavery at Tunis would be the consequence of being taken, had determined to blow up the ship rather than surrender.

Triests.

At Trieste there are two lazarettos; one new, but both clean, and a contract to those I had lately seen at Venice. The plan of the new one I give in plate XIII. The floors above were boarded, those below were of white bricks; the rooms were eighteen feet and a half by fifteen, had a heat bedstead, chair and table. It is surrounded at the distance of about twenty yards by a double wall, within which are separate burying places for Roman-Catholics, Greeks and Protestants. There is a current of water from the adjacent hills, which, were it properly conducted within the walls, might be very useful.

I am under peculiar obligations to the Director of the health-office for the rules and tariffs of this lazaretto (printed in German and Italian at Trieste, 1769) and for permission to copy its plan j and also the plans of the lazarettos at Marseilles and Venice, which I happened to discover here.

SECTION II.

PROPOSED REGULATIONS

AND

A NEW PLAN FOR A LAZARETTO.

HAVING now given the plans of the principal lazarettos in Europe, I shall in what follows take the fame liberty that I took with respect to prisons, and draw the oudines of a proper lazaretto*.—Many lazarettos are close, and have too much the aspect of prisons; and I have often heard captains in the Levant trade say, that the spirits of their passengers fink at the prospect of being‘confined in them. In those of them which I have visited, I have observed several pale and dejected persons, and many fresh graves. To prevent as much as possible these disagreeable circumstances, a lazaretto should have the most cheerful aspect. A spacious and pleasant garden in particular, would be convenient as well as salutary. See plate XIV.

But waving this observation, I will offer a few remarks respecting quarantines and lazarettos in general; after which I will take noti " 'fime advantages in respect of commerce as well as healthy which may accrue from such: merit in England. I will farther, in

the sequel, give the answers of some physicians abruuu to a lei of questions which I was led to propose to them, by considering that should a lazaretto be erected among us, and this country be ever visited with a lcourge so dreadful as the ,the opinions of eminent physicians experienced in this calamity might be of particular service.

OBSERVATIONS upon QUARANTINES and LAZARETTOS.

I. All vessels subject to a quarantine, arriving on our coast, should be obliged to hoist a red flag, or some other signal, at the main top-gallant malt head; in order to warn all

• By the Act, 12th of Geo. III. cap. 57. certain persons were empowered to build a lazaretto. And the Act recites “ that in the fifth year of the reign of his present Majesty, a sum ivas granted by Parliament, not exceeding five thousead pounds, towards building a lazaret.” But nothing has been done in consequence of this Act.

other flups against all communication with them; and all persons coming on board notwithstanding such warning, should be detained to perform the quarantine.

2. All boats belonging to any ship in quarantine, as well as all craft employed in unloading the fame, should be obliged to carry a red pendant at die mast head, whenever fer.t from the ship.

3. The ftiip’s hatch-ways ought not to be opened till the captain and mate have given in their depositions; and-all the passengers, the secretary, and such of the sailors who may be permitted to leave the ship, should be landed at the lazaretto, under a very severe penalty.

4. The place appointed for receiving depositions should be so contrived, that the person

who takes them may at all times place himself to windward of those who make them. This should also be observed as much as possible, at the barrier of the lazaretto, where people are permitted to Ipeak widi those in quarantine. But if not, they should be placed on this account at a greater distance from one another.

5. A fort of quarantine having been performed during the long voyage to England, and there being, in my opinion, a great probability that the infection cannot remain in any person without shewing itself, beyond forty-eight hours; the persons under quarantine ought to be allowed to quit the lazaretto sooner than is now customary in other countries. Perhaps a residence of twenty-two days may be fully sufficient.

6. Fumigating of passengers as practised at Marseilles is an advantage; for a person may carry the infection in his clothes, and commiinicate it to others, without taking it himself, as in the gaol-fever. But(this implies, that it ought to be done at the end of die quarantine, to those only who go out widi the clothes which they wore when they came in.

7. Great care should be taken, to keep at a proper distance from persons performing quarantine, all sailors and passengers as well as others. My reason for giving this caudon is, that I have seen persons just arrived in ships with foul bills, permitted at the bar of a lazaretto, to come very near to persons whose quarantine was almost over; and thus danger was produced of communicating the plague.—And here I shall take occasion to observe, that in my opinion, this distemper is not generally to be taken by the touch, any more than the gaol-fever, or small-po\; but e: by inoculation, or by taking in with the breath

in respiration the putrid effluvia hkh ..over round the infected object, and which when admitted set the whole mass of blood into a fermentation, and sometimes so suddenly and violently as to destroy its whole texture, and to produce putrefaction and death in Ids dian forty-eight hours. These effluvia are capable of being carried from one place to another, upon any substance where what is called feent can lodge, as upon wool, cotton, &c, and in the same manner that the smell of tobacco is carried from one place to another*.

It

• I am here reminded of a singular fast, which I gladly mention in honour to the memory of a worthy character. When the plague raged in London, in the year 1665, the infection was conveyed by means of a parcel of clothes to the remote village of Eyam, near Tidefvvell, in the Peak of Dcrbyshire. In this place it broke out in September 1665, and continued its ravages upwards of a year, when two hundred and sixty of the inhabitants had died of it. The worthy rector, WistMompeJJin, whose name may rank with those of cardinal Borrom$o of Milan, and

Sect. II. LAZARETTOS. 25

It is by these ideas of the communication of the plague that the foregoing rules have been suggested j and were the regulations for performing quarantine directed by them, some of the restrictions in lazarettos would be abolished, and more care would be taken to improve and enforce others.

It may be asked, how is it possible, if the plague be communicated by infected air, that a whole b'ody of men in a town where it rages should be capable of being preferred from it, as is the case with Englishmen in Turkey; and also, why every individual in such a town is not taken with it ? In answer to the first of these questions, it may be observed, that the infection in the air does not extend far from the infected object, but lurks chiefly,

(like that near carrion) to the leeward of it. I am so afiured of this, that I have not fcru-pled going, in the open air, to windward of a person ill of the plague and feeling his pulse.

The next question may be answered, by aiking why, of a number of persons equally exposed to the infection of the small-pox, or of the gaol-fever, some will not take it ? Perhaps physicians themselves are not capable of explaining this fufflciently. It is, however, evident in general, that it must be owing to something in the state of the blood and the constitutions of such persons which renders them not easily susceptible of infection.—The rich are less liable to the plague than the poor, both because they are more careful to avoid infection, and have larger and more airy apartments, and because they are more cleanly and live on better food, with plenty of vegetables and this, I suppose, is the reason why Protestants are less liable to this distemper than Catholics during their times of falling; and, likewise, why the generality of Europeans are less liable to it than Greeks, and particularly Jews, f And would not the former be still more secure in this respect, were they more attentive to the qualities^of their food, and lived more on plain and simple diet ?.

the good bishop of Marseilles, at its breaking out, resolved not to quit his parishioners, but used every argument to prevail with his wife to lpave the infefted spot. She, however, refused to forsake her husband, and is supposed to have died of the plague. They sent away their children. Mr. Momfejfon constantly employed himfelt during the dreadful visitation, in his pastoral office, and preached to his flock in a fi^ld where nature had formed a fort of alcove in a rock, which place Jiill retains the appellation of a church. He survived, and the entries in the parish register relative to this calamity are in his hand-writing, <uiz, 1665, in Sept. 6 died; Oft. 22; Nov. 5; Dec. 7.

1666, in Jan. 3 died; Feb. 5; March 2; Aprils; May 5; June 20; July 53; Aug. 78; Sept. 24; Oft. 17;

Nov. i. In the fields surrounding the town are many remains denctiYig the places where tents were pitched; and tombs are still existing of large families entirely fvvept away by *Kis devouring pestilence.

* It is remarkable, that when the corpse is cold of a person dead of the plague, it does not infeft the air by any noxious exhalations. This is so much believed in Turkey, that the people there are not afraid to handle such corpses. The governor at the French hospital in Smyrna told me, that in the last dreadful plague there, his house was rendered almost intolerable by an offensive fccnt (especially if he opened any of those windows which looked towards the great burying-ground, where numbers every day were left unburied); but that it had no effect on the health either of himself or his family. An opulent merchant in this city likewise told me, that he and his family had felt the fame inconvenience, without any bad consequences.

1 f The poorer fort of Greeks and Jews use much oil with their food; and this I reckon a disadvantage to them.

I have heard of instances of servants in European families, who through imprudence and carelessness, have been attacked with the plague, while the rest of the family have escaped it.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE IMPORTANCE

O P A

LAZARETTO IN ENGLAND.

Having been led by the similarity of the subject to extend my-views from and fcospitals to Lazarettos, my chief intendon in my last tour was to collect the regulations and plans of die lazarettos in Europe. On finding three English ships performing a long and tedious quarantine at Malta, it occurred to me, that a lazaretto in England might save time and expense, and for this reason prove an advantage to our commerce. I therefore consulted on this fobject our consuls at Zante and Smyrna, Chancellor Boddingten, and several intelligent and respectable merchants; and requeued they would give me their opinions. The result was their unanimous recommendation of such a design. From the merchants I received the following letter at Constantinople, of which they have given me leave to make what use I please.

« S I R,

Smtrna. * WE Batter ourselves that no apology is necessary for troubling you with this address, calculated to convey to you every information we are matters of, which we think may be ^ER“, of use to you in the attainment of the laudable end you have in view, to forward die inte-

CHANTS

Lstte*. rests of society in general, and those of the nation in particular.

We understand that when the building of a lazaretto was agitated in England some time ago, the chief objection to it was the great expense it would be to the nation, which did not reap any adequate advantages by the Turkey trade. We are are as much persuaded that the want of a lazaretto in England has been the cause of the Turkey trade not being, till now, more worth the notice of government, as that the establishment of one will render it an object of great importance to the nation. It will not only be productive of the immediate advantages which flow from an extensive and flourishing trade, but will free the kingdpm from the rilk it now runs of the plague being introduced into it. That a lazaretto will be pro-? duCtive of these two ends, we hope to prove to your satisfaction by what we are now going to Jay before you.

It is enacted by Act of Parliament, that when any vessel loads for England, in any of the ports of Turkey, and departs with a foul bill of health, such vessels shall perform quarantine at Malta, Leghorn or Venice:* the numberless hardships which this subjects

• ” And be it farther enacted That no goods or merchandizes liable to retain the infection of the plague, “ and coming from the Levant, without a clean bill of health, shall be landed in any part of Great Britain or * Ireland—unlefs it shall appear—that the said goods—have been sufficiently opened and aired in the lazarets of “ Malta, Ancona, Venice, MeJIiha, Leghorn, Genoa, and Marseilles, or one of them.” 26th Geo.

our export trade tt>, amount almost to a total suppression of it. A single accident of the plague in this" large city and its environs, or one brought from any other infected place, though this city'may be entirely free from it, obliges the consul to issue foul bills of health. As no information, to be depended upon, can be procured from die Turks concerning the' plague, and as the Greek nation is the next most numerous one in the city, the consuls apply to the deputies of it for information, when there are any reports of the plague, and according to the answer they receive, they either issue clean or foul bills of health. It often happens that the Greeks- themselves are authors of false reports. concerning the plague, and that their deputies inform the consuls of accidents having happened- in their nation, when in reality there is no plague in the: city or its environs. The motive which induces them to give this false information is obvious. The Greeks carry on three-fourths of the Dutch as well as Italian trade: it is therefore their interest (and unfortunately that of every other nation) to depress ours as much as possible; and there is not a more effectual method of doing this, than by obliging our vessels to go to perform a long and expensive quarantine in the ports of the Mediterranean, by which means the cottons which form their principal loading, as well as the chief article of both trades are no less than seven months on their way to London. This long interval gives the Greeks time to load their ships, and as they perform a very short quarantine in Holland (of the nature of which we shall speak more particularly hereafter) they ftipply our markets bp copious exportations of the cottons that were loaded here at the same time with ours, two or three months before our vessels can reach England. It is by this means that more than half the Turkey cottons consumed in England, are supplied by the Dutch to the great support of their Turkey trade, and the ruin of ours; and it is by this means that, whilst our trade is sacrificed by rigorous quarantine laws, to considerations of national safety, the plague may be introduced into the kingdom by the Dutch. To prove that this rifle actually exists, and in no small degree, we need only inform you of the method in which Dutch vessels, loaded here in the height of the plague, perform quarantine in Holland. On their arrival at Helvoetfluys a doctor is sent on board of them to visit the crew, which he does by feeling their pulse; after which he immediately returns to the shore, and reports the state of their healths: three or four days after this, the vessel is ordered to a place at a distance from the rest of the shipping, and two or three lighters are sent along fide, into which are only emptied the cottons that are in the ’tween decks, and the hatches' are opened on pretence of airing the goods in the hold, which form the principal part of the cargo, and which remain untouched till the forty days are over; when they are unloaded into the merchants warehouses, or into the vessels destined to transport them to England. Thus you fee, Sir, that one part of the goods perform a slovenly quarantine, and the rest may be said to perform none at all; for, as the air cannot penetrate into holds so closely flowed with cottons as they always are, the forty days they remain in the vessel after her arrival can only be considered as forty days added to her paf-sage. In this manner cottons are brought into England that have undergone no purift-

cation at all j and if it should happen that they are infected, nothing is more easy than the infection’s being introduced into England by their means. English vessels can only begin to load here direct for England, forty days after the last accident of the plague, and if any accident happen whilst they are in loading, they mull either go away immediately with the few goods they may have on board, or else they mull wait in port, on a cruel uncertainty, forty days after the last reported accident, whether seal or invented, if they do not prefer the hard alternative of continuing their loading, and going away with a foul bill of health, to perform quarantine in some of the lazarettos in the Mediterranean; on the contrary, Dutch vessels may be three months in loading, they may have taken the greatest part of their cargo in whilst the plague raged, and notwithstanding this, if they are in port forty days after the last accident, clean bills of health are granted them, ip virtue of which they only perform twenty-one days quarantine in the slovenly manner above mentioned.

Our government has reasonably laid a quarantine on cottons imported into England from Holland; but we understand- that when this has been the case, the quarantine in Holland, such as it is, has been curtailed by the connivance of those who should regulate it: by this manoeuvre, the end of our government in laying a quarantine, is entirely defeated. This total dili cgard of so fciious an object, as the regulation of quarantines must be, to all nations, gives so great an advantage to die Dutch Turkey trade over ours, that it induces their government, to overlook the risks the nation incurs by it; and when representations were made in Holland on the necessity of establishing a lazaretto to obviate this risk, and the fatal consequences which the introduction of the plague might be of to all Europe, the thrifty Hollanders, ever preferring the interests of their trade, to those of humanity, would not allow so forcible an argument to have any weight with them; but gave for answer, that it would be time enough to think of a lazaretto when the English had built one. The Dutch traders have so decided a superiority over us at our own markets, that it is only the necefiity gentlemen are in to have returns, which can induce us to ship any cottons at all during the existence of the plague here; for by arriving after our markets are supplied, loaded besides with ten fer cent, extra charges, incurred in the ports where they perform quarantine, they are sold to a considerable loss. This circumstance alone is sufficient to account for the present insignificance of our trade, and the consequent little advantage the nation reaps from it. In what a different situation would the establishment of a lazaretto put it ? By depriving the Dutch of the advantages they now enjoy, we should be able to supply the whole quantity of cottons demanded at our markets; instead of only fending five thousand bales we should fend more than double that quantity annually; and as by a fixed regulation of the Levant company, we can only purchase the pro-duds of this country with the produce of goods sent from England, the importation of our manufactures would increase in the fame proportion. The quantity of shipping employed in the trade would likewise be doubled, and by earning the freight which

is

is now paid to the Dutch, 9n the cottons they send to England, it would be so much clear gain to the nation, added to the advantages which would attend the extension of its navigation, and the increase of the consumption of its manufactures; advantages which are now enjoyed by our rivals the Dutch, the prosperity of whole trade is founded on the ruin of ours.

We are aware that the building of a lazaretto would colt the nation a considerable sum of money; but we think the commercial advantages it would derive from it would alone be more than a compensation for such a charge. It would not only be the ships which load in the ports of Turkey, but those from all die ports in the Mediterranean, which would contribute to its support.

Admitting, however, that the Turkey trade is not so far worth the notice of government as to induce it to build a lazaretto for it, the consideration alone of its preserving the nation from the great rifle it now evidently runs of such a great calamity as the plague being introduced into it, we presume is of sufficient importance to make government determine on a measure which every state in Italy has considered lb necessary, that the moll: insignificant among!! them have their lazarettos. The knowledge you have acquired of the plans and regulations of these, and every other lazaretto in Europe, in your present tour, is so much superior to any information we can give you, that we do not presume to trouble you on the subject. , — —

Should your representations meet with die success they will deserve,. the nation at large will experience in a new instance, the advantages that can be derived from the pursuits of a —- individual, who, from the noblelt motives, dedicates himself to the interests of humanity, and we, as well as every other member of the Levant company, shall consider our-selves as indebted to you for the revival of our drooping trade.”

To the foregoing letters, I will add the following reasons fora lazaretto in England, which I received from a very intelligent merchant in the'Levant.

First. Our cotton manufactories will then be regularly supplied with Turkey cotton direCtly from the place of its growth, and consequently there will no longer be any occasion for their being supplied from Holland, France, and Italy, as has been too much, the case since the consumption of this article in England has become so very considerable, to the no small prejudice of the nation:* as such cottons purchased

• Perhaps the trade to Turkey is more beneficial than to any other country; for we there receive raw materials, which we return manufactured: for cottons, by articles of agreement with the Ottoman court, are not paid for in money, (as hemp, iron. &c. are in Rulfia) but by our manufactured goods, Thu trade though clogged is still considerable, as may appear from the exports in the year 1786.

As it is calculated that at least: one half of the cottons that are manufactured in England are purchased in Holland, France, and Italy;* and as these cottons, it is presumed will, after a lazaretto is built, be imported direCtly from the place of their growth, there will consequently be employed near double the tonnage now employed by the Levant company, to the no imall advantage of the nation, arising from the clear profit of the freights, the increase of our navigation, and the increase of our exports in goods instead of specie. f

j. fn answer to the objection that Turkey will not take off any more of our fabric* and staple commodities, than are now consumed there, it should be observed, that, as the importation of cotton into Holland, France and Italy, will decrease for want of the usual demand for the London market, their exports will also decrease in proportion; and consequently make room for a greater quantity of ours. The Dutch will no longer fend our tin and lead adulterated to the Turkey markets. They and the French will fend thither a less quantity of their cloth, and this will make more room for our lhalloons, which have already begun to give a fatal blow there to the French cloth trade.

We may also supply the Turks with part of those East and Weft Indian commodities, which they now receive from the French, Dutch, and other nations.

4. The building of a lazaretto in England, and the prohibition of the importation of any Turkey goods, any other way than direCtly, will be the effectual means to prevent the introduction of the plague, of which there is now very great danger, on account of the cottons that come to us by way of Holland. These, though Hupped in the Levant, in time of the plague, are, while under quarantine in Holland, never opened and aired, as is done in all the lazarettos in the Mediterranean, but forwarded to England in their original packages, where they perform again the fame slovenly quarantine; and are then font down to our manufacturing towns, where they are first unpacked, and where by this means the plague may very easily be introduced.

With regard to the danger of the introduction of the plague from Holland, the following translated quotation from Dr. Hodgess ‘Treatije on the Plague of London in 1665, will confirm the opinion above stated. “ With respect to the origin of our

“ pestilence, I do not hesitate to affirm, from the fuileft authority of undeniable testi-« mony, that it first entered this island by means of contagion, and was brought from “ Holland in merchandise imported from that country, where it had made great ravages “ the preceding year; and if any one is desirous of inquiring further into its origin, I u inform him, that if any credit is to be given to report, its feeds were brought into “ Holland from the Turkish empire, along with cotton, which is a most faithful preserver “ of contagion.” Section II.

I will add that a lazaretto in England would prevent the following danger. Some merchants in the Levant, when the ships mull come out with foul bills; fend the cottons to the islands, or some other places which are clear of infection, there to perform quarantine. But this quarantine being (as I have seen) a very flight one, of only twenty days, and yet entitling the ships to clean bills with which they come to England, is by no means a sufficient security.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE PLAGUE.

O N my departure for my late tour, I was furnished by two of my medical friends. Dr. Atkin and Dr. Jebb, with a set of queries respecting the plague, to be put to some of the most experienced practitioners in the places which I meant to visit. I fulfilled this commission as well as I was able, and brought back the result in several papers in the French and Italian languages, which Dr. Atkin, to whose atfiftance I am indebted for a variety of profefiional matter in this work, has methodized and abridged so as to form one connected article. I here give it to the public; with a view of shewing the opinions prevalent concerning that disease in the countries where it is best known by experience, and thereby establishing some of the most important relative to its prevention.

Giovanblli, Physician to the Lazaretto at Leghorn. The plague cannot be communi-

cated without very near approach or touch of an infected body or substance; and the air cannot be the vehicle of this infection.

They, Physician to the Lazaretto at Malta. All who approach the atmosphere of a peftilendal body may receive the infection by relpiration} and it is almost always observed that the contagion is received before approaching or touching the lick perl'on. Yet it may happen that a person may inhabit the fame chamber with, and even touch a patient in the plague without being infected j instances of which I have known.

Morandi, Physician, Venice. Contact is one of the mod powerful and dangerous means of communicating the infection; but for the developement of its effects a predifposition in the receiving body is necessary.

Verdoni, Physician, Trieste. It is moll; frequently communicated by the touch. It has been given by a flower held and smelt at, first by two persons who remained free, then by a third, who was seized and died in twenty-four hours.

A Jew Physician ^Smyrna. The infection is in reality communicated by the touch alone j for all who keep from contact of infeCted persons or things remain free. To the effect of contact, however, a certain dilpofltion of the air is necessary; for we often fee infected persons arrive from other countries, yet the disease does not ipread. But what this dilpofldon is, can scarcely be conceived. Commonly, in this climate, the disease appears at the end of lpring, and continues to the middle of summer, with this particularity, that in cloudy weather, and during the firocco wind, the attacks are more frequent. Also, in the fame diathefls of the air, some receive the infection, while others exposed to the fame dangers escape it. From observation it appears, that cacheCtic persons, and those of constitutions abounding in acid, do not readily take it. The contagious miafms may lie dormant in the body for some time without doing the least harm, till set in motion by sodden fear, or the excessive heat of a bath.

Fra. Luigi di Pavia, Prior of the Hof pital of San Antonio at Smyrna. The plague is communicated by contaCt, according to all the observations I have been able to make for eighteen years.

2. Does the Plague ever rife spontaneously

Raymond. Incontestible experience daily proves that it only proceeds from contaCt.

«■

Demollins. ' From all ages, the plague has only been brought to Marseilles by merchandise, or persons from beyond sea.

t Giovanelli. As the disease always appears with the fame symptoms, it is probably not spontaneous, but the consequence of a particular contagion.

They. Some contagious fevers come of themselves; others proceed from the communication of contagion. The plague is thought to have originated in Egypt* and ipread itself from thence.

Sect. Ill*

Morand!. Contagious fevers do not arise of themselves, but art always the product of a peculiar poison.

VEkDONi. I know no fever that can properly be called contagious, and doubt if even the plague can be considered as such. My reasons are drawn from the very different manner in which the plague appears in different years; and the different degree in which it spreads. I therefore conclude that contagious fevers come of themselves.

Jew Physician. According to the most ancient authorities, the plague has always been brought to Smyrna by contagion, and was never produced here.

Fra. Luigi. Ancient and common observation in this city proves that the plague is derived solely from contagion.

Question 3. To what distance is the Air round the patient infeRed? How far does aflual contafl-^wearing

Third* inf efted clothes, or touching other things—produce the disease

Raymond. The infected are conversed with without danger across a barrier which fepa-rates them only a few paces.

Demollins. The air round the patient is infected more or less according to the degree of the poison which exhales. Here, in the lazaretto, they are spoken with across two barriers a few paces from each other, without fear of contagion. Hence it would appear that the plague is communicated only by the touch, or still more by wearing infected clothes.

GiovaNElh. If one (peaks of an infected person shut up in an unventilated chamber, it may be said diat die whole atmosphere is dangerous; but if one (peaks of a patient exposed to the open air, it has been proved that the sphere of infedUon does not extend beyond five geometrical paces from his body. Beyond this distance one is in safety. The actual touch of an infected person or thing is proved to be very dangerous by fatal experience j but to what degree, is not ascertained.

They. The infection only extends some paces; and the miafms at the distance of about ten paces are so corredled by the air, as to lose all their activity. It may be communicated by touching infected things, especially of a porous nature, as cloth, wool, skins, &c.

VERDONr. From the moment of infedlion, to the time when nature has entirely diffi-pated the contagious principle, which usually happens in forty days, there is always a capacity of communicating infedlion. The degree of infedlion is in proportion to the volume of air surrounding the patient; the air being what absorbs, difllpates and destroys the contagious principle. Infected fubstances communicate the disease for many years, in proportion to the ventilation they have undergone, or of which they are susceptible.

Jew Physician. The degree of infedlion in the air about the sick depends upon the greater or less malignity of the disease, and other circumstances. The air about poor patients is more infedlious than about the rich. These things being established, I am of

opinion,

Opinion, that in &£ greatest contagion one may securely fee a patient at the distance of two ells (four braccia) if the chamber windows be not all fhiit.

Fra. Luipi. The infection is greater qr less in proportion to the yirulence of the contagion} but I have made no observation as to the distance. The disease is communicated by confaft of all iofeCted things, and by close inspiration of the breath of the lick.

between the Inflexion and the Disease. Fourth.

Raymond. The plague shews itself at all fealons; but less at the two solstices.

Demollins. Great ravages may be made in all seasons} but principally in the greatest heats of fumipex.

From the infection to the disease is two or three days.

G.iovanellx. The plague appears at all times, in the same manner as poisons at all times produce their effects. But observation shews that its ravages are greater in hot seasons than in cold} and it seems that summer and the first months of autumn are moil to be dreaded.

There is no certainty as to the interval between the infection and the disease, as it depends on the particular constitution of the patient.

They. Warm rnoift fafons contribute to the production of all contagious diseases.

The interval from the infection to the seizure is various, according to the virulence of the poison and the constitution of the patient. Sometimes it acts (lowly, sometimes like a stroke of lightning.

Verdoni. The spring is the principal season.

Generally the disease shews itself at the instant of the touch, like an eleCtrical (hock. Sometimes a person retains the contagious principle without any sensible effect, and after feverjd days communicates it unknowingly to a third, in whom, if predisposed to the disease, it becomes aCtive} or otherwise, it may be communicated to others successively in the fame way, till it becomes difiipated and annihilated, as happened at Smyrna in 1783.

In bodies predisposed it very rarely conceals itself till the third day.

Jew Physician. Answered in the first.

Fra, JLaiigi. The plague is most fatal in Smyrna from April to July} and it is constantly observed that great colds and heats much diminish it, and copious dews extinguish it.

The infection shews itself in twenty-four hours, more or left, according to the difference of temperament.

THE PLAGUE.

Sect. IIT*

Raymond. The plague often conceals itself under the form of an inflammatory’, ardent* or malignant fever. Tumours of the glands are fomedmes its first symptom.

Demoll ins. The first symptoms of the plague vary; but the most common are buboes in the armpit and groin, parotids, and carbuncles in various parts of the body.

Giovanelli. The first symptoms are, debility, fever, excessive thirst followed by great heat; after which, carbuncles or buboes appear in the parotids, armpits, and groin. This last is sooner attacked than the armpit.

They. Swellings in the armpits and groin are, indeed, the characteristics of the plague* yet they are neither the foie, nor the first symptoms; and often are not seen at all, as when - the plague disguises itself under the form of other diseases.

Morandi. Glandular swellings are properly the symptom of the second stage, and are preceded by those febrile symptoms which are immediately consequent upon the reception of the contagion; such as, pain in the head, drowsiness, great prostration of strength, dry-nefs of the tongue, vomiting, hiccough, tremor, diarrhoea.

Verdoni. Its first symptoms are relative to the constitution of the year, and of the body seized, and the place where it was produced, or whence it came. In 1783 all the parts of Natolia were infefted; and the disease transported to Smyrna, which is in the centre, was extinguished without the death of a single person. Generally, the plague of Constandnople transported to Smyrna does little harm. That of Egypt causes havock as in every country. That of the Thebais is always cruel, and carried to lower Egypt is fatal. The inguinal glands are the most generally affected.

Jew Physician. The swelling of the glands is seldom the first symptom. Patients Vre every day seen, who, being supposed ill of another disorder, in two, three, or more days shew glandular swellings or carbuncles, by which the plague is manifested. On the contrary, many, who from the usual signs are supposed to have the plague, become well in a day or two without the least tumour or external appearance. The first symptoms are, horripilation, or actual shivering, nausea or vomiting, loss of strength, and fever. These are common to many diseases; but the pathognomonic signs are, a difference in the pulsations of the two fides, with this circumstance, that from this diversity a prognostic arises; it having been observed, that if the pulse on the fide of the tumour or carbuncle be greater or more frequent, it bodes well; whereas if it be smaller, it lhews greater malignity, and there is more to be feared. Further, there is observed among the first symptoms a visible pulsation in the carotids, greatest on the affected fide; and also a crystalline vivacity in the eyes, with a kind of contraction and diminution of the eye on the fide affected.

Fra. Luigi. The most remarkable symptoms of the plague are, turbidnefs and spark-ling of the eyes, the tongue furred with a white mucus, and very red at its tip, frequent biting of the lips, violent pain in the head and inability to hold it up, a sense

of great cold in the loins, vomiting, debility. Swellings of the glands are not among the first symptoms.

or at leaf by near approach to infeSed persons -or things

Morandi. It is certain from multiplied observations, that there are two forts of pefti-lendal fevers, similar in appearance; one of which proceeds from the contamination of the air alone, and is communicable to any distance; the other is produced alone by contact, or near approach. The former of these is properly termed a pestilential fever, the latter a contagious one.

Verdoni. The distin&ion of these fevers is useless, since the fame which is communicated by the touch is that also which is conveyed by the air to a certain distance, especially in a close place.

* Jew Physician. That there are two kinds of plague is absolutely to be denied; yet fomedmes it happens that persons are attacked with the plague without knowing whence it came.

Fra. Luigi. I hold it for certain that there is only one species of plague, though differing in malignity.

Raymond. The disease is treated as inflammatory. No specific has been difoovered for it.

Demollins. At the beginning, bleeding, vomiting, purgadves, diluents, refrigerants and antifepdcs are used; afterwards, antifepdcs and cordials, relatively to the temperament and symptoms.

Giovanelli. The plague, causing_always a disposition to inflammation, and putrefaction, it is always proper to bleed proportionally to the strength, and to ule a cooling regimen, with the vegetable acids. The repeated use of emetics is also proper, both to cleanse the first passages, and to dispose the virus to pass off by the Ikin, In the progress,. it is necessary to favour the evacuation of the virus by that issue which nature seems to point at. Thus, either antiphlogistic purgatives are to be given, if nature points that way; or suppurative plasters are to be applied to any tumours which may appear. Epilpaftics to the extremities are proper where nature wants routing. The vitriolic acid in large doses has been found very serviceable in the plague with carbuncles, as was proved in the last plague at Moscow. When the inflammation is over, and marks of sup-

puration appear, the bark with wine and other cordials is proper. The surgeon’s assistance is requisite in the treatment of boils and anthraxes, which last are seldom cured without the actual cautery.

They. In the beginning of pestilential fevers, bleeding is sometimes proper, and vomits almost always. In their progress, frequent subacid and cold drinks, the bark given liberally, and vitriolic acid, have been found powerful remedies when there was a difiolu-tion of the blood.

Morandi. In die first period, evacuations according-to the peculiar circumstances of the case are proper. In the second, bark mixed with wine; and opium as a temporary fe-dative. Pure air is very necessary j and fire, as a corrective, with the burning of antiseptic and aromatic substances.

Verdoni. As soon as a Christian finds he has got the plague, he eats caviare, garlic and pork; drinks brandy, vinegar and the like, to raise the buboes. Upon these he applies greasy wool, caviare, honey of roses, dried figs &c. to bring them to suppuration.

The Turks and Arabs drink bezoar in powder with milk, and other sudorifics, to expel die virus. They vomit, and possibly a second time.

At Cairo they take opium, and cover themselves with mattresses in order to excite sweat j and though parched with heat and third:, they drink nothing. They open the immature buboes with a red-hot iron. _-----

At Constantinople and Smyrna they eat nothing, and drink much water and lemonade. The Jews drink a decoction of citron feeds, lemon or Seville orange peel, and their own urine. They abstain scrupulously from animal food.

In 1700 a physician in Smyrna found bleeding very useful. Another, in another year, cured the plague by bleeding and an antiphlogistic regimen.

My brother in Cairo treated it like a pituitous biliary fever, with vomits, saponaceous attenuants, and antiphlogiftics, and successfiilly.

Some sailors in Constantinople in the phrensy of the plague, have thrown themselves into the sea j and it is said that on being taken out, they have recovered.

My opinion upon the whole is, that the treatment ought to be relative to the particular constitution of the year, and of the patient, by which the nature of the disease itself is greatly varied.

Jew Physician. Bleeding in many cases may be serviceable, as I have known patients who were bled by mistake, recover j and others recovered from a most desperate condition by a spontaneous haemorrhage. On the other hand, persons have been apparently injured by both these circumstances. The difference of effect seems to depend on the state of the blood, whether it be disposed to coagulation or dissolution. In the former, bleeding is useful, in the latter, hurtful. Vomits according to my experience have not succeeded; yet I lliould not hesitate to try ipecacuanha in substance, exliibiting half a scruple at two or three times, in the expectation that in this manner it would not run downwards. Bark

lmy be of use in diffolutions of the blood 5 and also small doses of opium, and other medicines prudently administered. In excessive watchfulness I have known relief procured by anointing the temples with Ung. populeon. In a case of hiccough the Uquor Anod. Miner. Hoffinami succeeded with me.

The Turks, in the violence of the fever, take handfuls of show and apply it over their bodies, and also eat it j and likewise sometimes throw cold water on their feet. But whether this is of service or no, cannot be determined; as these people in other respetts pay no regard to rules of diet.

Fra. Luigi. They who practise empirically in the plague use none of the recited methods, Shut only strong sudorifics, and ventilation of the air; and complete the cure by proper treatment of the fores from suppuration.

8. When the Plague prevails, do the physicians prejcribe to those who have the disorder a more

generous, or a more abstemious diet; and do they prejcribe any thing to the uninfelded

Jew Physician. In times of the plague, many are accustomed to eat no flesh; others, no fish; but I know not whether from the advice of physicians. For myself, I have been in many plague-years, but have made no alteration in the management of myself.

Fra. Luigi. In Smyrna, the plague is generally treated with a rigorous diet. They Only use rice and vermicelli boiled in water j and sometimes, when the patient is too costive, juices and herbs boiled without any seasoning. From time to time they give some acid preserves, and raisins, and in great heats some (lender lemonade, and a dish of good coffee with a biscuit every day. For drink they only use toad and water j and they follow this abstemious regimen till the fortieth day of the disease is completed; after which they take chicken broth, lamb, and other food of easy digestion.-

9. Are Convalescents subject to repeated attach from the Jam

Raymond. Not unless they touch something infefted.

Demollins. Convalescents are sent to fumigated chambers, and there are no instances of relapse.

Giovanelli. No instances of relapse after being well recovered from the first attack have come to my knowledge; but they are liable to fall into other disorders, as , haemoptoe &c.

They. Convalescents are without doubt liable to a relapse, and authors are full of instances of it. In the plague of Medina, M. fays that a man had successively four-

teen buboes, and was cured at last.

Morandi. All convalescents may relapse.

Verdoni. They have it not twice in the same year.

Jew Physician. Convalescents are often attacked anew,' and die; but this does not’ usually happen from a fresh infection taken elsewhere, but from some remains of their own contagion, excited by intemperance in food, or the venereal acct.

Fra. Luigi. From irregularities in eating 2nd drinking, bodily fatigue, affections of the mind, and especially anger, they are liable to repeated and very dangerous relapses.

10. What is the proportion of Deaths, and the length of the

Raymond. The mortality is different in different seasons and years.

Demollins. In the plague of Marseilles in 1720 half the inhabitants perilhed. The usual length of the disease is that of other acute disorders, but longer when the tumours come to suppuration.

Giovanelli. The proportion of deaths is variable and uncertain. As to duration, when the disease is very acute and fatal, the patient generally dies within five days from the first invasion of the fever, or first marks of the plague. When he recovers, no certain termination can be assigned. If the time of healing all the fores be reckoned, it may run on to three, four, five months, or more.

They. The mortality is very various. Of ten whom I treated in the lazaretto, three died. I have observed that the fever usually runs on to twenty or twenty-one days.

Morandi. The bills of mortality of places visited by the plague usually amount to about thirty per cent, sometimes they rife to fifty. (He seems to mean of the whole num* ber of inhabitants.)

Verdoni. The proportion of deaths varies infinitely. It has been observed that the Jews in Constantinople and Smyrna lose only one third, which is attributed to the care they take of their sick. At-Calro, on the other hand, they are the first attacked, and lose more than three fourths. The Turks lose two thirds; other nations a little more or left: the Europeans at Cairo lose five sixths.

Sometimes it kills immediately; sometimes in twenty-four hours; commonly in three days. When die patient gets over the ninth day, there are great hopes of recovery, as the buboes are then suppurated. They may, however, die within the fortieth day, especially if they commit any irregularity, the principal of which is eating fleffi, which instantly causes 4 return of fever, and death. It never pafies beyond the fortieth day.

Jew Physician. The mortality is various, as also die duration. Some die in two, three, or four days; some hold out fix, eight or more.

Fra. Luigi. Generally more die than survive; but in our hospital of San Antonio of Smyrna, from the care taken of die sick, the number recovering has for eighteen year? past exceeded that of the dead.

Demollins, Here, in the lazaretto, infefbed goods and furniture are exposed to a current of air for forty days. The air of infected places is purified by burning all forts of aromatic plants, and sulphur.

Giovanelli. The method of prevention is, to avoid all communication with infected persons or goods. The means of flopping the contagion form a body of police, too extensive to be here mentioned.

They. The means of prevention, besides avoiding infected things and persons, are, so-brjety in living, the use of vinegar externally and internally, and an iflfue.

Infected places are purified by fumigation and ventilation, by scraping the lime from the walls (which is then thrown into the sea) and white-walhing them anew with lime and sea water, by walhing the floors, windows, doors &c. first with sea water, then with vinegar, taking great care to leave nothing that is infected. The bodies of the dead are buried in a place set apart for that purpose; and their beds and bedding are burned. As to other things, not uled during the illness, the linen is washed with soap and ley; the woollen clothes are put into sea water for two days, and then ventilated for twenty days; those which would be lpoiled by water are hung on a line in the air for forty days, and fumigated from time to time according to their quality.

Morandi. A fire is to be kept constantly in the sick chamber, in all seasons. All feces &c. are to be immediately removed. Clean shirt and Iheets daily. The healthy must avoid commerce with the infected; must purge gently now and then, smoke tobacco, drink pure wine medicated with wormwood, gentian, zedoary &c. and avoid fear and other passions, and excess of all kinds.

Jew Physician. No means of prevention are used in the Turkish dominions.

Fra. Luigi. The means used for flopping the contagion are purifying places and things by fire, water, and air.

Verdoni. The best preservatives are reckoned to be, sprinkling the room with vinegar, perfumes, ventilation, and fumigation. The Greeks in Smyrna, during Lent, when they eat only vegetables, are very seldom attacked; while among those who eat flesh the contagion makes great havock. Hence the best means of prevention are to eat moderately, and not at all of animal food; to drink water and vinegar j * to sprinkle the chamber with the latter, and use frequent ventilation; to change the clothes, especially the linen, daily, hanging in the air for ten or fifteen days those that have been used. For suppressing the infection, every thing is to be washed that can undergo the operation, and the walls of the chamber to be whitened with lime; but after the 24th of June no further care is taken.

OBSERFJTIONS.

Though there are various points in which the answerers of the preceding questions disagree, yet it is with pleasure J observe that they all in the most explicit manner concur in representing the plague as a contagious disease, communicated by near approach to, or a£bual contact with infected persons or things. This is a fact of the greatest importance to be establirtied, as all the proposed means of prevention by cutting off communication with the sources of infection, must depend upon it: it is a fad too, which one would suppose after such manifold and repeated experience, no one would now call in question. Yet a late medical writer of reputation,'Dr. Maximilian Stoll of Vienna, has not scrupled publicly to hazard an opinion, diat the plague is not contagious; and this even with a view to the natural but most dangerous consequence, that the usual means of preventing its Ipread from one country to another by restrictions on commercial intercourse, are unnecessary and improper. This doctrine is alferted in his Rationis Medendi, pars Jecunda, printed at Vienna in 1778 P' 59 andfeq.J.It does not belong to me to enter into a medical disputation on this head; yet I cannot avoid observing, that it appears very Arrange and suspicious, that he should go back to Livy's Roman History for proofs to establish his point, totally neglecting all the fads concerning the numerous visitations of the plague recorded in modem medical books* or which had happened during his own time. I suppose professional men will lay very

The ingenious Dr. Schoite, in a treatise on a contagious fever, which raged at Senegal in the year 1778, and proved fatal to the greatest part of the Europeans, and to a number of the natives, (published in 1782 by Murray in Fleet-street) considers the following among the predifpcfing causes of the difeafethe garrison subsisting, during the whole yearre^iefty upon animal food, particularly upon fresh beef which is supplied by the Moors the brackilh well-water in which their victuals are boiled, and which serves them as constant drink ;-<-the impure air breathed by many of the slaves, who are locked up together in the fame room during the night;—and the •want of motion during the day time, which the irons on their feet impose on them.

Among the means of preventing the disease, the doctor mentions the necessity of temperance in eating, drinking Sec. yet he acknowledges that governor Clarke lived very regularly in every respect; he “took the tintture « of bark and bitters three times a day, and used every’ other precaution to avert the disease, but ineffectually.” This German physician has said much in praise of wine, and tells us: “ From my own experience I believe that « wine has in some degree a power of expelling a newly-received infection, or at lead of contributing towards €€ expulsion. And the use of this with sarsaparilla he thinks was the means of curing himself of that disease;” « yet” he adds, page 158; “ as thconly European, who escaped this disease entirely, did not make the lead ufc of « any spirituous liquor, I would confine my advice to such persons only, as are accustomed to it The person in « question, w^o affords this very striking exception, is a Mr. Hare, master of a merchant ship, who had been « at Senegal backwards and forwards for several times, but was residing there, at the time the disease raged, and « for two years before. He was more exposed to the infedlion than many others, for he lived in the house of a « dreadful-looking patient, who was swelled and puffed up, before he died, like a putrid corpse. He also waited 4* on him out of humanity day and night, because the blacks were afraid of going near him, on account of hi* « most dreadful appearance. He never drank a drop of any spirituous liquor, not even beer or cyder, and he « told me, that he had not for ten years past, but that he had made use of it before that time. His only drink ee at meals was water, and plenty of tea and coffee in the morning and afternoon. He made not the leaf! use of « tobacco in any form, and took no precaution whatever to prevent the infection.1

little stress upon all that can be said of pejlilen in general which happened inwars and sieges two thousand years ago, as applied to the plague properly Jo ,a disease then confounded with various others, from which the accuracy of later observations have sufficiently discriminated it. This extraordinary mode of reasoning on such an important subject, too much confirms the account I received of the matter in Germany; which was, that with a view of ingratiating himself with the prince in whose service he lived, and who might be supposed desirous of getting rid of the expense and inconvenience of lazarettos and other establifhments for the prevention of contagion. Dr. Stoll had been induced to make an attack upon the principle upon which every precaution of this kind must depend.* I must, however, observe in his vindication, that at the beginning of this century, the faculty of medicine in Paris gave a decisive opinion against the contagious nature of the plague, and their delegates acted conformably to this doctrine in the case of the dreadful visitation of Marseilles in 1720: the bad effects of which prepofjefion are shewn in a very sensible manner by Mr. Bertrandy in his admirable relation of that calamity. It is also observable, that in the foregoing answers. Dr. Verdoniy in replying to the second query, from theory denies that any fever can properly be termed contagious, though under some of the other heads of inquiry, he asserts with as much confidence as the rest, that the plague is actually communicated by contact. Such are the effects of a preconceived hypothesis in perplexing or obscuring theplainejl matter of fact 1

* modes of effecting a cure; one by art, the other by nature.

i. That by art is the use of sudorifics, recommended by many writers of the highest reputation, particularly, Sydenham and Diemerbroeck. — Simples for this purpose, viz. con-trayerva, serpent. virg. rad. angel, emuela campan. petafitis, gentian, camphor &c.

. 2. The natural method of cure is the expulsion of the poison to the glands and Ikin.

Of these external appearances, buboes are the most important and ufefol.—They should not be livid or black, soft or puffy, nor increase all at once to a great size.—When they have begun to a ppear, the sweating plan should not be adopted.—To be quickly brought to suppuration, by emollient and gummy plasters; and either suffered to open Ipontaneoufly, or opened by art, but not till perfectly maturated. — Carbuncles less favourable than buboes:—to be treated mildly, and not with cautery and incifioncataplafms or plasters of emollient herbs to be used; then ointments, cerates &c.

If particular symptoms are unusually troublesome, they mull be attended to separately. Of these the most confidcmWc is Fever.—This is sometimes periodical, and then bark is proper.

Cutaneous efflorefcences are dangerous; petechiae, if livid or black, almost always fatal.

Diarrhoeas and haemorrhages from any part, dangerous, and should be stopt as soon ■as possible.

For obstinate vomitings, tire best remedy is lemon juice and salt of wormwood.

Somnolency and watchfulness are each at times prevalent. The former to be prevented "by agreeable discourse, or smelling to volatiles; the latter, by theriaca or diafcordium.

ABRIDGMENT OF A RELATION OF THE PLAGUE OF SPALATO

IN THE YEAR 1784,

Given in a Letter from an Officer to his Fellow-Citizen Venice.

PRINTED AT VENICE IN 1784.*

In July 1782 the plague was reported to be in Turkilh Bosnia, and a line of troops in consequence was polled on the frontiers j but on the news that the disease was only a common epidemic, this was withdrawn. The plague, however, breaking out with great fury in the capital city of Serraglio, the line was again placed in June 1783.

The danger was the greater, as in the famine of 1782 many inhabitants of Venetian Dalmatia had gone into the adjacent Imperial and Turkilh territories, whence it might be expeXed that they would now return.

At the end of June 1783 the plague broke out in the town of Dolaz in Paglizza, where it was brought by the returning emigrants.

Ca/erns, or wooden huts, were ereXed for the reception of all the emigrants, under the inspeXion of the military polls in the frontiers.

In Augull, the disease appeared among the caferns, near the poll of Billibrigh, and Ipread to the national militia there encamped.

Soon after, it appeared in the large town of Etuazza in the territory of Sign, and Ipread to many other places of diat distriX.

In September, the plague broke out in the suburbs of ClilTa, the territory of which immediately borders on that of Spalato, on which account a reparation was made by means of stockades and bars. The maritime towns and islands were Hill allowed free communication with each other.

THE PLAGUE.

In October, the territory of Knin appeared to be infected.

The district of Cliffa was first freed from the contagion, its quarantines being completed in February 1784, after the death of three hundred and twenty persons.

Next to that, the territory of Knin became free, with the loss of two hundred and sixteen.

Lastly, Sign was difinfected, after twelve hundred and seventy-six deaths.

On January 30th, 1784, one Simon Chiapiglia of the borough of Luzaz, adjoining to Spalato, after a fever of five days, was found to have a tumour in the groin of a suspicious nature, especially as he had been employed as a porter in a lazaretto, from whence, after his quarantine, he had been difmififed on January 2 ift. He was put under close guard, but the next day, being delirious and attempting to escape, he was shot by the centinel, and killed. No further marks of suspicion appeared on the body. His family were put . in the lazaretto, but remained in health.

On February 5th, a boy died after an illness of four days on board a Rovignefe vessel, laden with wool, skins, bags &c. belonging to Ottoman subjects of Bosnia, which goods had undergone purification in a lazaretto. The boy’s disease was declared by the physician to be only a verminous fever. The vessel failed away on February 9th, and on the 21ft put into Porto Cigalle in the island of Loflin Piccolo, where the mailer and two sailors were taken ill, and soon died. This excited an alarm, and the two remaining sailors and goods were put in a lazaretto, along with three galley slaves, and all underwent a thorough purification. But neither these sailors, who wofe the clothes of their deceased comrades, nor the slaves, were attacked with any sickness.

On the 10th of March, some deaths, after ihort illness, began to take place in Spalato j in such, however, the physicians recognized no contagious quality.

On March 15th, a woman died with petechias, which caused fa much suspicion that the physicians recommended particular precautions with respect to all who had been about her, or handled the body.

Other suspicious deaths succeeded, but without certain proof of contagion} however on the night between March 28 th and 29th, fix deaths happening after a very short illness, caused the reality of the contagion to be scarcely doubted of, though still the signs of the plague were equivocal.

On March 30th, news arrived that the persons placed in the lazaretto from suspicion on account of the woman above mentioned, had fallen ill. Five more died this night} and on the view of their bodies, the physicians declared them JypeSled; but a Venetian surgeon did not scruple to call the disease openly the plague. A buboe was this day found on a patient.

The Proveditor General now assembled the college of health, and laid an interdict on the whole city, Ihutting up the churches, and cutting off all communication with the rest of the province.

He himself with the public officers, soldiers &c. to the number of one hundred and nineteen persons, shut themselves up in the generality-palace, situated without the city, but contiguous to the walls.

All the cities in the different territories had orders to separate themselves from each other, and the coast-line of troops was armed.

The public lazaretto was also detached within proper limits.

On April 3d, the proveditor issued the proclamation annexed, for the regulation of the city.

The contagion now began to spread in every part of the city and suburbs, and through all ranks of people. It got even into a monastery, where an abbess and some nuns died.

The first mode'of separation practised, was to place a large number of wine-vats in a certain part called Brecchia, to serve as receptacles for the moll: suspedted persons of the city, who were taken out of the infected houses, and lodged there.

A large house, and some other adjacent ones in die borough of Luzaz were then set apart as an hospital for the infected.

A camp was then formed in St. Stefano, a remote and open place, into which the fof- pedted, after walhing in the sea, and change of all their garments, were taken. Many soldiers and town’s people were received into this, most of whom were thereby preferred . from infection.

Another camp was afterwards formed, in a different situation, for the fame purpose. All diefe were provided with a deputation of health from the city, guardians, officers, in-spedtors &c. and a report from them was sent every morning to the supreme authority.

. A second hospital was established in another part of the suburbs.

The quarter of St. Domenico evacuated of its inhabitants, and applied to the * purpose of a lazaretto; and a convent in it was reserved for the nobility and principal fa-

milies.

Forty-six days had now elapsed since the manifest eruption of die plague, and yet no accident had happened in the generality-palace, when suddenly two galley fiaves employed there were seized and died; but it was impossible to discover how they caught it. On this account, the proveditor, accompanied only by the persons most necessary to the management of public business, seceded to Caftello Vitturi, and the rest were sent to the.

' lazarettos.

In an infected city there are three conditions of suspedted persons.

1. Simply JufpcSled. These include all the inhabitants of the city, and they are allowed to walk about freely with the proper cautions, and at certain hours.

2. Grievously JuJpeBed. These are such as have had any communication with persons infected: they are confined to their habitations.

3. Most JuJpeSled; who are those in whose families the disease has appeared. These are removed from their houses, and after the sick are sent to the hospital, the rest are sent to the camps, where huts are erected for each individual j in which having passed forty days, they afterwards spend forty more in a lazaretto.

The convalescents were placed in a lazaretto by themselves.

As it was desireable to clear the city as much as possible of inhabitants, many of the families of nobility were received into the palace after it had been purified •, and many goods of all kinds were sent to the lazarettos for purification.

The dead were conveyed from distant parts to the burying ground, by water, in boats towed by other boats.

From May 25 th the mortality began to abate, and this diminution continued, till June 29th, after which none died.

The city of Spalato contains three thousand two hundred inhabitants, and the boroughs about nine thousand. The whole number of deaths was one thousand two hundred and one.

AN ACCOUNT OF FOREIGN PRISONS AND HOSPITALS.

I set out on my last foreign tour in November 1785, and went first to Holland. I stayed there a few weeks, and made some observations on the prisons and hospitals. But I will defer my account of these observations; and begin with the prisons and hospitals at Lyons in France. I was there in the latter end of December; and in the prison of St. Joseph there were then about sixty criminals in the inner court, and fourteen in the dark dungeons twelve steps under ground. I perceived, however, some effects of a more liberal spirit towards the prisoners than I had seen in my former visit; for several who were confined in the dungeons at night, were in the day permitted to be in the court; and a new prison is building in which there will be no dungeons, and the rooms for the separation of prisoners, will be less close and confined.

La Quarantine (a house built on die bank of the Soane, without the city, for those

who fled from the plague at Marseilles in 1720) is now used as a prison for vagabonds and beggars. These are lodged in ten lofty and airy rooms twenty feet square, which open into a corridor about ten feet wide. There are several other rooms, some of which I found occupied by venereal patients, f All the rooms have opposite windows for giving a free passage to the air; and there is also plenty of water constantly running into stone troughs. J

La Charite, or the General Ilospital, is an excellent institution, the establishment of

which was occasioned by a dreadful famine in France in 1531. The first distribution of bread, during that calamity, was here made to many thousands who crowded into the city. The silk manufacture also, by which the trade of this flourishing city has been lb greatly increased, began at that time: and a large manufacture is still carried on in this

• An architect, who was employed in finishing the draught of the new prison at Tholouse, told me, that it was built on arcades; had a surrounding wall, and no dungeons; and that each prisoner was confined without irons, in a room about eight feet square and ten high. This information was confirmed to me by an inhabitant of that city.

+ Here I saw the surgeon flupify many of the female patients, by the new and dangerous deception of animal magnet ifm,

J In the court where I was confined in the lazaretto at Venice, there is a large well, and at the fide of it an ancient circular stone-basin, which still continues very convenient for washing the linen of those in quarantine.

I have seen such conveniences in the prisons in Spain, and have often wished to fee them in our own prisons. 1

hospital, in which a great number of children are employed, who are clean, and neatly Lyons clothed in—black—white—and blue, to distinguish—the foundlings—legitimate children Hospital. abandoned by their parents—and orphans. These children are kept in the house till so late an age as twenty-five, that they may contribute somewhat to the expense of their education, and also be better able to-maintain themselves after being discharged.

I was surprised to find the state of the Hotel-Dieu so different as it was, from my former Hotel-account. But having not then seen the well-regulated hospitals ofltaly and Spain, perhaps IEU'

I was now too much struck with the difference; and, perhaps also, an allowance should be made for my now seeing this hospital in the depth of winter. The summer white furniture of the beds was changed into a dirty blue harrateen, with useless fringes, well fitted to retain infection. The rooms were nasty and offenlive; and two patients in many of the beds, but not one window open} the-medical gendemen here, and also the charitable JiJiers, being prejudiced against a free circulation of air, as well as against keeping rooms clean by washing them.

There are particular rooms destined for such of the sick as pay twenty-five Jous a day.

These always lie single, and have some little distindtion in their diet. There is also a room for the purpose of distributing medicines three times a week. An account of these, and many other particulars respecting this extensive charity, may be seen in a small volume, quarto, entided, Statute et Reglements Generaux de I'Hotel-Dieu de la ville de Lyon.

A society in this city, called. La Confrairie de la , was established in 1636, of the fame kind with one which I formerly found in Italy, and whose principal object is, visiting, assisting, and succouring prisoners.

At Avignon, the PriJbnfor the province is in the old palace, in which are two large Avignon and lofty rooms for men, and one for women, with a chapel. The prisoners, January 7, Prison-

1786, were fifteen in number, all men, and none in irons. The cruelty of irons would here be very evident} for the thickness of the stone walls, the proximity of the gaoler’s apartment, and the fierceness of his dogs, mull prevent an escape. On taking notice of the rings, pullies, &c. for the torture the gaoler told me, he had Jeen drops of blood mixed with the sweat, on the breasts of some who had suffered the torture.

The allowance to the prisoners is one pound and a half of bread a day} but on Sundays and Thursdays they are supplied with a white loaf, broth and wine, by Les Freres de misericorde,who also bring them clean linen, every week in summer, and once a fortnight in winter. When a criminal is condemned to death, he is informed of his sentence at midnight} and at this hour, these charitable brethren go to him, and conduct him to the chapel} where they continue with him till he is executed, which is about ten o’clock the next morning.

The Hospitalcontains two Ipacious wards for men, and two over them for women*

with an altar at the end of each ward. The patients are clothed in an uniform s and they lie Angle, in beds about eight feet asunder. At the foot of each bed is written the patient’s name, place of abode, entrance and diet; and likewise the prescripdons of the doctors, who, as well as the religieufes make their visits every day. More attention seems to be paid here to cleanliness and air than at Lyons; but yet the surgeon complained that the flow (hospital) fever was produced by the infectious air of the house.

At Marseilles, the Prison at the palace is small, and in January 1786, was crowded with prisoners. The court and rooms below are for criminals, the rooms above for debtors. The criminals (about sixty) lay on barracks, with straw mattresses; roost of them were very dirty, but especially the sick. Their bread was good; the allowance two pounds a day; and I was informed that Les Frcres de m supply them with soup every day, and with clean linen once a week, and visit the prison twice a week.

In the great Hospital, the patients had iron bedsteads, with curtains and tellers. On the fide of the wards there are covered walks or terraces; very necessary for hospitals in cities, which have not the advantage of gardens for convalescent patients. There is a new staircase, which is easy and convenient for the sick (being fix feet wide, the steps sixteen inches broad, the rises three indies and a half) and, very properly, all of (tone, with iron rails.

The Galleys, formerly at Marseilles, are now removed to the atlenal at Toulon. Five were moored near each other, and have their names on the stern, as the Firm, the , the Intrepid &c. In them there were about sixteen hundred prisoners, who are obliged always to wear a bonnet or cap, on which is fixed a tin plate with a number. Their caps were grey—green—and red, to distinguish,—deserters—smugglers—and thieves; these last are always branded before they leave the prison of the place where they were condemned; some with the letter V (for Voleur) others with GAL. on the left Ihoulder.

These galleys had only one deck. Many of their windows in the roofs were open; and, being swept twice every day, they were clean, and not offensive. The slaves also were kept clean, and their clothing was neat, even in that galley which is appropriated to the aged and infirm. Some of diem had been confined forty, fifty, and even sixty years. All have a coat, waistcoat, trousers, two Ihirts, and a pair of shoes, given them every year; and a great coat every two years. They had good brown bread, well baked, in loaves weighing a pound and three quarters. All had some little allowance in money, and to those who worked was granted an additional allowance of three Jous every day for wine. In each galley there were two cantons (little rooms) one for wine, for those who worked for government, the other for the sale of white bread, greens &c.

• I have wished, from a regard to the health of the prisoners, that these friars would employ part of their charity in donations to those of the prisoners who are most cleanly in their persons and rooms; and in procuring the courts to be washed, and the prison to be lime-whited, as criminals will gladly work, when in prison, for one-fourth of what they could earn, were they not in confinement.

Many worked at their own trades, as shoe-makers, balket-makers &c. but none were allowed to keep (hops on shore as formerly at Marseilles; nor have they the fame convenience they had then for the sale of their work. Forty were at work in La Plate (the square) in the city, digging and removing the foil for the foundation of a house for the intendant. * These were chained two and two, and when one wheeled the mould, the other carried the chain j but in digging, sawing, and other stationary employments, both worked. Many were at work in the Arsenal; and employed, some in moving, hewing and sawing timber; and others in the cotton and thread manufactory. The number of those engaged in the lad of these employments was about two hundred. They were lodged in an adjoining hall; and I observed, that when they left off work they were searched to prevent their lecreting any of the materials. All were loaded with chains of some kind or other. Those employed in the manufactory (and some others in the arsenal) had only a ring on one leg; but this, and likewise the choice of irons, I found to be a distinction which might be purchased. The slaves who worked out of the arsenal were loaded with heavy chains; and few are able to escape: if any do escape, they are punished, when retaken, in various ways.—Some by a confinement under heavier irons—Some by a recommencement of the term of their confinement—Some by whipping—And such as had been condemned for life, by hanging.

Protestants are not compelled to attend at mass. The last person who was confined for his religion, was released about eight years ago. There is but one Have here who now

the galleys forty-two years, for being concerned with some boys in a quarrel, with a gentleman (who loft his gold-headed cane) in a private house in Paris. The boys were apprehended, and this Conde, though only fourteen years of age, and lame of one arm, was condemned to the galleys for life. After four or five years he procured a bible, and learned by himself to read; and becoming, through close attention to the ferip-tures, convinced that his religion was antich, he publicly renounced it; and declared and defended his sentiments. Ever since he has continued a steady protestant, humble and modest, with a character irreproachable and exemplary, respected and esteemed by his officers and fellow prisoners. I brought away with me some musical pipes of his turning and tuning.-* He was in the galley appropriated to the infirm and aged; and these, besides the usual allowance of bread, have an additional allowance from the king of nine fous (4 {d.)a day.f

In going over the wards of the marine lI observed nothing remarkable. Its situation in a populous part of the city is very improper. The want of a free circulation of air must produce contagious disorders among the patients; and this will expose the surrounding inhabitants to great danger.

I lay a few nights in the old castle of Portman, in the isle of Port Crofce, and found there an ancient prison. The descent is by a ladder, through a stone aperture of four feet diameter; which, after the ladder is removed and the hole covered, is a secure, but dreadful, place of confinement. As this is a prison similar to many in castles, in the barbarous ages, when security only was regarded, a drawing of it may not be unacceptable to some of my readers. See plates xv. xvr.

The Prison at Nice has three stories, with four or five good rooms on each floor, which open into a gallery eight feet wide. The keeper has a neat room or two for the better fort of debtors. Irons are never used except when prisoners are riotous or unruly; and when this happens they are chained to the wall. Their beds have mattresses and blankets. Their allowance is two pounds of bread a day, beside supplies from charitable contributions; of which some came whilst I was in the prison.

There were about two hundred and fifty galley-slaves (lo called) in dirty rooms near the water, who were at work in the pontons for clearing the harbour. Their bread was good, of which they had a daily allowance of two pounds, besides four ounces of dried beans, without salt. They have also seven allowed them in money, on the days they work; but two feus and a half of this sum are deducted for supplying them with soup. Sundays and Thursdays are idle days with them, anti then they are allowed only the two pounds of bread. * It may not be improper to add, that as the term of their confinement draws towards a conclusion, their slavery is relaxed, and some liberties are granted them.

At the llospital of Savona, as the old surgeon went over the wards with me, he observed how improper it was not to separate chirurgical from other patients; or to suffer, as often happens, a person with a fractured bone, to lie with a person in a fever (though

Many are placed Handing; but an hundred thousand crowns entitles to a chair.

In the new Prison at Rome, February 1786, the infirmary was clean, and the sick were, as at the time of my former visits, in clean wards, and in separate beds. In the noble Hospital of San Micbaele I passed two mornings, and found it sadly neglected by the cardinal and the inspectors, who never visit it. The present pope’s favourite inllitution is a seminary or school for young women j where neatness, oeconomy and industry must give pleasure to every visitant.

Malta Prison. The Prison at Malta eonfifls of several dirty and offensive rooms in the town-house, where in April 1786, there were nine pril'oners. One of them, a Turk, had suffered the torture; in consequence of which a mortification had taken place, and the surgeon was applying the bark internally, and' externally: the second time I law him he was but I did not continue long enough in the island to know the event.

Slaves. The Slaves have many rooms, and each feet their chapels or mosques, and sick rooms apart. A woollen manufactory is carried on by some of them; but the majority are blacks, and unhappy objects. For die religion (the knights lo called) being (worn to make perpetual war with die Turks, carry off by piracy many of the peasants, fishermen, or sailors from the Barbary coasts. How dreadful! that those who glory in bearing on their breasts the sign of the Prince of peace, should harbour such malignant dispositions against their fellow creatures, and by dieir own example encourage piracy in the states of Barbary. Do not thtfe knights by such conduct make themselves the worst enemies to the cross of Christ, under the pretence of friendship ? In this city there are two large hospitals, one for each sex, supported by the knights.

The inflitution of the knights (of Malta) was in the tenth century, at Jerusalem, for the care of the wounded in the Christian wars; they afterwards settled in the iflc of Rhodes, but~being driven from thence in 1530, this island of Malta was given them by Charles the fifth, king of Spain and emperor of Germany.

now tamed black; the windows being small,' and the walls hung round with dully pic-cures, this noble hall makes but a gloomy appearance. All the patients lie Tingle. One ward is for patients dangeroully Tick or dying; another for patients of the middle rank of life; and the third for the lower and poorer fort of patients. In this last ward (which is the largest) there were four rows of beds; in the others, only two. They were all so dirty and offenlive as to create the necessity of perfuming them; and yet I observed that the physician, in going his rounds, was obliged to keep his handkerchief to his face.—The use of perfume I always reckon a proof of inattention to cleanliness, and airiness; and this inattention struck me here forcibly on opening some of the private closets, with which this hall is very properly fumished.—There are several other wards, and some single rooms for such of the knights as choose to come here when lick. There is likewise a large apartment in which the governor (always one of the knights) resides during the time of his being governor, Which is two years. He has a salary; and is generally, as a sensible gentleman here told me, a young and unexperienced person; others, either not liking the confinement, or being fearful of catching some distemper.

The great ball already mentioned is on the ground floor; and under it is another hall, or rather a large ward, which is nothing but a dark and damp arched cellar. Here were cutaneous patients; also fifty-two old infirm servants from the city, who are maintained by the religion. The first and the under-physician, with the surgeon, a few pupils, and one or two attendants, take the round or walk of the upper wards; but in this ward the first physician does not attend. In the great hall there is a slate fixed on the closet door at the fide of the beds of the patients, on which the initial letters of their usual medicines, diet &c. are written. On this slate also one of the pupils always marks the doctor's order, so that, at his next visit, he may fee his last prescription. When these gentlemen go their rounds, all the patients are required to be in their beds.

The patients are twice a day, at eight and four, served widi provisions; one of the knights, and the under-physician constantly attending in the two halls, and seeing the distribution. From the kitchen (which is darker and more offensive than even the lower hall, to which it adjoins) the broth, rice, soup and vermicelli are brought in dirty kettles first to the upper hall, and there poured into three silver bowls, out of which the patients are served. They who are in the ward for the very sick, and those of the middle rank of life, are served in plates, dishes and spoons of; but the other patients (who are

far the most numerous) are served in pewter. I objeflcd to the sweet cakes, and two forts of clammy sweet-meats, which were given to the patients.

The number of patients in this hospital during the time I was at Malta (March 19th to April 19, 1786) was from five hundred and ten, to five hundred and thirty-two. These were served by the most dirty, ragged, unfeeling and inhuman persons I ever saw. I once found eight or nine of them highly entertained with a delirious dying patient.

The governor told me they had only twenty-two servants, and that many of them were

debtors or criminals, who had fled thither for refuge. * At the same time I observed, that near forty attendants were kept to take care of about twenty-six horses and the fame number of mules, in the Grand Master’s stables; and that there all was clean. I cannot help adding, that in the centre of each of these stables, there was a fountain out of which water was constandy running into a stone basin; but that in the hospital, though there was indeed a place for a fountain, there was no water.

There is great want of room in this hospital. I requested that a delirious patient who disturbed the other patients, might be lodged in a room by himself; but was told, no such room could be found. Opposite to this hospital there is a large house, which is now uled only for a walh-house. A great improvement might be made by providing a wash-house for the hospital some where out of the city (its only proper situation) and appropriating these spacious and airy apartments to poor knights and convalescent patients. The flow hospital fever (the inevitable consequence of closeness, uncleanlinels and dirt) prevails here.

At the back of the hall, over the knights’ arms (a cross) is a marble crown, and under it on white marble is this infeription,

INFANTIUM INCOLUMITATI.

Here is a wooden cradle, which turning on an axis, the pins strike a bell, to give notice of the reception of infants into the Foundling Hospital. These infants, after being received, are sent to the governess of that hospital, who provides nurses for them in the country; and on the first Sunday in every month, these nurses bring back the children to shew them and at the same time to receive their pay; the governess, very properly, being present On one of these occasions, I had the pleasure of seeing a number of fine healthy children.

In the Hospital for Women there were two hundred and thirty patients, who had all separate beds. The governess attended me through every ward, and was constandy using her smelling bottle; in which flie judged very properly, for a more offensive and dirty hospital for women I never visited. f

• « Even a murderer,” added the commilfary, “ cannot be taken if found in this hall.” Every church in Malta, where the sacrament is administered, is a sanctuary for debtors and felons; in that of the Dominicans, and also of the Augustins there were one or two persons.

+ Sir William Hamilton favoured me with a letter to the Grand Mailer, which I presented after my first vtfit to this great hospital. He very readily and kindly said, that the prisons and hospitals should be all open to me. On a subsequent visit, he alked me what I thought of his hospitals. I faithfully told his Highness my sentiments, and made some of the remarks that I now publish; adding, if he bimfilf would sometimes walk over the hospitals, many abuses would be corrected. But my animadversions were reckoned too free; yet, being encouraged by the satisfaction which the patients seemed to receive from my frequent visits, I continued them; and I have reason to believe they produced an alteration for the better in the Hate of these hospitals, with respefl to cleanliness and attention to the patients.

In the Foundling Hospital there were thirty-nine girls from seven to about twelve years of age, who were clean both in their persons and dress, ,but very pale. They have no proper place for exercise, and but two bed-rooms, one of which is close and offensive. A piece of ground, which might contribute to their health by being made a play-ground, is a fort of useless garden.

Near the city are two Houses for the Poor. In that for men, there were one hundred and forty poor persons, who are lodged in eight or nine rooms in a range, on the ground floor; with a church appropriated to them, and apartments for a chaplain adjoining. Their allowance is a brown loaf (weight exactly i lb.) some soup, and a little cheese, and on some days, a penny in money; and many of them have a small garden. There being no common , or dining-room, every one carries his provision into his bed-room. On the whole, however, these infirm perl'ons are pretty well supplied and accommodated.

In the house for women there were two hundred and thirteen, to whom a kind attention seems to be paid by the governor, who has convenient apartments adjoining.

Near these poor-houses, there is a particular Convent called Casa della Manrija founded by a Spanish prince, in which travellers Jlriftly conforming to the rules of the house may lodge and board for forty days, at a small expense. It is a fort of religious retreat, and very pleasant. I here passed l'ome hours two afternoons; and found all still, quiet, and agreeable. The passages, the rooms, and the church were elegantly neat, and perfectly clean. Over the door of each room there was a picture of some person famous for virtue and piety. The windows looked towards the garden. The refectory is a beautiful hall painted with subjects from feripture history. In the church, under the delks of the' feats, were boxes with sand which turned on a pivot, to prevent the floor from being foiled. Three priests constantly reside in this pleasant retreat.

At Zante, the Prison consists of two rooms on the ground floor, at the back of the guard-house. There were in May 1786 five or six prisoners, very dirty, yet scarcely distinguished from the tattered Venetian soldiers. f

• Before I leave Malta I would just mention, that the staircase at the Grand Matter’s palace is the most convenient for infirm persons that I have ever seen; from which hints may be taken for the more easy afeent to the upper wards in our hospitals. It is circular, nine feet and three inches wide, the rises two inches and a half, t ' the steps at the widest end two feet two inches, and at the narrowest nine inches.

■f- Here is another room used for a prison, adjoining to the health-office, in which was confined the principal pirate concerned in seizing the ship called the Grand Duchess, bound from Leghorn to London. Three volleys of ihot having been aimed at him without killing him, he was despatched by a pistol applied to his ear. His head and the heads of his two companions were fixed on poles. The two latter became mere flculls within two months, but his head and even his countenance continue (as I was allured) much the fame, though three years have elapsed lince his execution.

There were besides, two fenall unfurnished rooms in die back court, intended for persons infected with the plague, f In a situation almost opposite to this, the gentlemen belonging to the Dutch Factory

In those cities which I have seen in Turkey, the debtors have a prison separate and distinct from die felons.—Without such a separation in England, a thorough reformation of- the gaols can never be effected.

The Prison for Criminals at Smyrna is situated near the sea, and consists of two rooms and a court. So speedy is the execution of justice here, that I found in this prison no

• One morning I attended the Cadi and other officers of the police when they visited the (hops and examined jhe weights used in them, and the quality of the bread sold by the bakers. All false and light weights they cut and carried away. Such of the (hop-keepers as were judged to be delinquents were either sent to prison, or immediately baftinadoed; that is, laid on their backs to receive on the foies of their feet, a number of strokes, at the discretion of the Cadi. I heard of a person who had received four or five hundred of these strokes; but I can hardly suppose it possible to survive a much less number. —Such hasty executions of, what is here called justice’, are very improper and cruel. The terror which appeared in the countenances of all the (hop-keepers at these times implied, that the innocent as well as the guilty might fufter; and, indeed, it is scarcely possible this should not sometimes happen, the Cadi, who orders and superir.tcnds these punishments, continuing in his office only a year, and being generally young and unexperienced.

f As but very few died of the plague in Smyrna in 1786, the houses of the Franks were then all open. These live in a part of the town quits separate from the Turks. In like manner at Constantinople, all the European ambafiadors and merchants live by themselves in the suburb of Pera; where, while the plague rages, they ftiut their houses. All provisions then brought to them are taken at the doors and dipped, in water; and all letters are received with a pair of tongs, and fumigated before they are opened.

in the house. I saw them at dinner on wholesome bread and soup. They looked healthy; and from the placidnefs of their countenances, I inferred the humanity of their keeper; and I was a witness of his shewing them an attention which in such houses, is of particular importance.

The Hospital is now converted into barracks for soldiers, the Tick being removed to one

of the dissolved monasteries, which is finely situated, and has a Ipacious garden. The rooms are lofty. The bedsteads were of iron, and (very properly) had no tellers. The bread was good; but (as is too common in these houses) given the patients on the very day it was baked. '

In the Great Prison at Vienna, in December 1786, I found very few of the dungeons empty: some had three prisoners in each dungeon; and three horrid cells I saw crowded with twelve women. All the men live in total darhiefs, and are not permitted to make *any savings from their daily allowance (of four creutzers) for the purpose of procuring light. They are chained to the walls of their cells, though so strong, and so defended by double doors, as to render such a security needless. No or clergyman had been near them for eight or nine months; and this is reckoned, even by these criminals, so great a pun'fiement, that they complained to me of it with tears, in the presence of their keepers.

I recollected a dungeon in which, at my former visit, I had seen a prisoner dying; and on mentioning this, one of die turnkeys said, “ Yes, he died about a year agowhich i

another confirmed. This, however, mull have been a different person j for eight years had elapsed since my former visit.

The torture-room lies nine Heps deeper than die dungeons; but I will say nothing of this room, nor of the instruments of torture, because the Emperor has shewn his humanity and wisdom by abolishing this shocking practice.

All the prisoners in the old prison just mentioned, are to be soon removed into a Prison lately built by the emperor. It consists of forty rooms, and also twenty dungeons at the depth of twenty-two Heps below the surface of the ground, boarded with thick planks, in which are strong iron rings, for the purpose of chaining the prisoners. These dungeons are larger, and in other respects (though horrid enough) leys horrid than those in the old prison. They were empty, but above them were two hundred and fourteen criminals crowded into a few rooms. Their daily allowance is four creutzers. I was pleased to find here a set of rooms for trying the prisoners.

In a prison for the confinement of convicts, called the Great Cafern, there were eighty-six men all in one large room. At the front of this prison, there is a chapel and a guard-room; and at the fide of it, a room for searching the prisoners, to prevent their taking with them improper instruments when they come from work.—Their employment is cleaning the streets—Their allowance on idle days (that is, holidays and Sundays) is one creutzer for bread (weight 15 oz.) one for soup, and one for greens: on other days, four creutzers.

is, even in the day time, offensive beyond expression. Indeed, it would not be wonderful, if the effluvia from these prisoners, while they work in the streets, should spread through this city an infeSHon destruttive to the health, and fatal to the lives of the inhabitants.

In the Little Cajem (another prison for confining convicts) there were in two rooms forty-two criminals j about a third of whom were at work in one of these rooms, and the rest were idle in the other. Allowance, the fame as in the great cafern. The guard in the great cafern consists of a corporal and fix soldiers j in this, of a corporal and four soldiers. These guards will not suffer any thing to be given to the prisoners; and there is likewise in this city, a Uriel prohibition of giving to vagrants and beggars in the streets.

In die House of Correction, women only are at present confined. Allowance, one pound of bread, and two dishes of different kinds of soup, once a day. Great attention seemed to be paid to the ftek. Their rooms were clean, and separated from the other rooms. — Of one hundred and fifty-three prisoners thirty-five were ill; a high proportion, but not higher than might be expected in a prison where no bedding is allowed.

The criminals sent off to Hungary are brought first to this prison. They are clothed in an uniform, and chained in companies, five and five together, with irons round their necks and on their feet; besides a chain about ten inches long between the feet of each of them/ and another chain about fix feet long for fattening each of them to the persons next to him. — I was told, that the hard work in which they are employed, of drawing boats up the Danube, with their coarse fare, wears them out so fast that few of them live in this state above four years.

The House of Correction, in which vagrants chiefly, and a few debtors are confined, was lately a monastery. The rooms and passages are airy and Ipacious, and the house is well supplied with water by a stream that is constantly running. The debtors and vagrants were confined in separate rooms, but of the former there were only seven. The number of the latter was one hundred and forty-nine j and they were employed in carding, (pinning, weaving &c. Count Pergen is here giving an useful example of humanity, and readiness to make improvements. It was owing to his great attention, that I always found this house clean, and in good order. There is an office belonging to it, in which accounts of its state are kept, with much regularity. A paper or journal was given me containing these accounts, divided into eighteen columns, in the following order.

Hospital.

The hospital in the suburbs, called the General , is very large, and contains

several courts. Most of the wards are seventeen feet high, sixty-one feet long, and twenty-seven broad; with opposite windows; and twenty beds in every ward, with vacancies between them three feet wide, in which tables were placed. Some of the wards were much larger.—They were all furnished with basins, towels &c. and great attention seemed to be paid to cleanliness. To each ward three nurses are assigned, and a room of a moderate size, with a fire place for washing and other purposes. The roof has windows in it, but unhappily they are glazed; and consequently the free efcaipe of the foul air is prevented, and much evil must be produced.

At the back of this hospital, there are twelve neat rooms, with every thing in them proper for lying-in women — a bed—drawers with white child-bed linen — a toilet — tea things—-and a bed for the nurse. These rooms are for those that pay one florin a day. There are other rooms with five or six beds in each, for such as pay half a florin a day. The former advance at entrance the pay of eight days; and the latter the pay of four days. There are rooms also for those who pay ten creutzers a day. All in this department was clean, calm and quiet. Women are admitted at any hour, through a private door and passage, and no questions are asked at their coming in, or going out.

The new Tower for Lunatics, near this hospital, has five stories, and twenty-eight rooms on each floor. The doors open into a passage fix feet wide, which goes round the building. Though great attention was paid to cleanliness, the passages were very offensive; the form of the building causing the air to stagnate in its centre, as in a deep well.

In the chancery (or accountant’s room) the numbers given me, December ij, 1786, were as follows:

In the General Hospital, 389 Men. 424. Women.

Lunatic Hospital, 183-* 78 ——

Total 1208

Daily expense for provisions, 141 florins, 56 creutzers and 2 cratx.

In the Military Hospital, Dec. 14, 1786, there were five hundred and fifty-one patients. The wards are similar to those in the general hospital, and the passages (very properly) eight feet wide. Neither these, nor the patients were so clean as in the former hospital, the attendants being soldiers sent hither by their officers, as a punishment for drunkenness or small offences; and from whole pay (which is five creutzers) three are deducted for their proviffon. A surgeon of a battalion attending in each room, keeps the wards quiet. There are thirty of these surgeons, of whom fourteen reside, and attend alternately with the others for a fortnight. There is also a superintending surgeon, to whom the other surgeons make reports every day.*

• I have all the plans of the above hospitals; and should any gentlemen wilh to inspect them, they are much at their service.

In the Convent of Let Freres de Charite,the long ward is twenty-five feet and a half wide, and contains one hundred and fourteen beds with green furniture, and (very properly) without tellers. All was Hill and quiet: but in such monastic institutions the waixls are always kept too close. This convent has a house belonging to it, properly furnished with beds, cisterns, towels &c. for convalescent patients. It Hands out of the city j and the wards front a pleasant garden. The feet of the patients are washed at coming in} and being here well attended and nourished, they generally go out fitted to follow . their usual occupations.

In the Convent of St. Elizabeth, there are fifty beds for ftek women in one ward, twenty-three feet wide, on the ground floor, with folding doors in the middle to separate the-slightly sick from the other patients. About sixteen good flflers carefully attend this convent} but (as usual in convents) it wants a proper circulation of fresh air. The emperor encourages it} and the fame is true of the society of the order de S. Johartne de Deo, which, as I learn from the printed lifts, has many convents in his dominions and other-parts of Europe.

In this city there are many other noble institutions; which, being the objects of the emperor’s particular attention, and having been either founded or improved by him, manifest a public spirit which does him great honour} and gives a striking example to other potentates. Some of thele I will just mention.

There is an Hojpitalfor Invalids, which was formerly the house for the poor.

In the present House for the Poor, the aged, the infirm, and incurable ace lodged and provided for in separate rooms} and great attention appeared to be paid in it to order and cleanliness.

The Foundling Hospital was lately a convent. It has partitions* between the rooms, but no doors. The windows and apertures near the ceilings and floors are so contrived as to keep the rooms fresh, and free from offensive feents.—There were here above eighty infants, to every two of whom, while they are in the house, a nurse is assigned; but they are not continued long here, much the greater part being kept constandy under the care of nurses in the country, whose pay for children under one year old is two florins and thirty creutzers: for children from one to ten, two florins: but from ten to fifteen, only one florin per month, f—The whole number of children supported by this hospital was in December 1786, one thousand one hundred and eighty-nine. No child is admitted widi-out some pay. Twenty-four florins will procure admission for any child under the age of a year. If the parents are poor, and produce a certificate from the minister of the parish, only twelve florins are required; which sum mult be paid by the parish, if there are no-parents, and the child has been taken up in the street.

• 8och reparations by partition are proper in all large houses of correction or indullry. They render those houses more quiet. They make a proper reparation more easy, according to the different kinds of work in which perfoQs are employed. And they enable overseers to make their visits more unexpectedly.

f h florin is sixty creutzers, or about 2 of our money.

The dormitories are Hospita*!.. twenty-nine feet wide, and the passages into which they open eight feet and a half These passages I observed to be furnished with proper washing-places for the children. The beds are placed fix feet from the wall, that the governor (as he told me) may fee that all is clean. The mattresses, being of straw, are changed every three months; and the children have clean linen given them once a week in winter, and twice in summer. The great attention in this hospital to cleanline/ and air makes the proportion of sick in it very small.

Here is a new institution of the emperor's for the support and instruction of the deaf and dumb, under die care of a clergyman. The boys were clothed in dark grey, and the girls in green. Some were winding silk — spinning—weaving &c. And others were employed in a printing-office. One day in a week is appointed for a public inspection of them. The clergyman proposes by signs questions to them, and they write their answers on a large date provided for that purpose.

Here is also a house where persons who are out of employment may find work. * I saw, in a large room, many cheerfully carding and spinning. But the number of persons thus provided for (six hundred and fifty-five) being greater than could be conveniently employed in the house, most of them were allowed to carry die materials for their work to their own houses.

I took the liberty of mentioning several of these remarks on the prisons and hospitals at Vienna, to the emperor, when he did me the honour of giving me a private audience j and he has relieved the miseries of many unhappy sufferers. -

There is in this city a fixed price for meat, as well as an assize for bread and flour.— The butchery is, with the utmost propriety, carried on in the suburbs, and the meat is prepared for sale there, before it is brought to the public markets. The fame order is observed in all the other cities of the empire; and this may be one reason why I never saw, in any city on the continent, an over-driven ox.

At Francfort, the House of Correction and the House for the Poor join, and are under one direction. The porous stone on which the men are employed in these houses, is brought from the banks of the Rhine. They beat it with wooden pestles in a large stone trough bound with iron j and the powder, mixed with lime, makes a cement impenetrable by moisture, and as hard as stone. This is sent to Holland, and many other parts of Europe. The women do the laborious work in the apartments for the poor. In January 1787, there were here fifty men, diirty-five women,-sixty-four boys, sixty-one girls, twelve prisoners, seventeen vagrants; in all two hundred and thirty-nine. The house, though old, was clean. Half of Saturday in every week is appropriated to the business of cleaning the apartments. It has a chapel, and a room in which die governors meet twice a week. It is inspedted also by the ladies; and the regulations of it are published. The allowance of provisions is good bread and beer, soup twice a week, and meat on Sundays and Wednesdays. f

The yifylum for Lunatics, built in 1783, is worthy of observation. The master’s apartment, the kitchen, and offices are on the ground floor. On this and the second floor there are several rooms (fourteen feet by twelve and a half, and about twelve high) with one, two, or three beds. The passages are only five feet and a half wide, but the landing place in the centre of the house, being twenty-seven feet wide, with four windows, gives light and air to the whole. J An aperture always open in each window, added to the quiet-

nefs and cleanllnefs of this house, would be a great advantage to it, and probably hasten the recovery of the patients. Here is a large and neat Lutheran chapel, in which the governors, the public, and the injane have separate feats assigned to them; and the last are so placed as to be concealed from the audience during divine service, and in coming in and going out.

At a litde distance from Nassau, on the other fide of the river, there is a ruinous castle which was formerly the residence of the princes of Nassau, who are now branched into several families. There are still remaining two or three dungeons of the prison in the tower, which must have been dark and dreadful places, having only one small aperture for air, and the defeent to them by ropes or ladders. I omit the dimensions, as I have given the plan of a similar one at Port-Crofce (fee plate xvi.) and shall take occasion to mention one or two in England.

I have observed in my State of the Prijons, p\ 137, that the mode of execution at Aix-la-Chapelle for citizens, is by decollation with a broad sword. It may not be improper to add, that it is concealed from the view of the public by a scaffolding round the spot where it is performed.

HOLLAND.

At Bois le Due, the prisoners convicted of small offences are font to die spin-house at Breda, described in the State of Prijons, p. 51.

In the Stadt-house at Amsterdam, December 1785, there were seventeen debtors; and January 24, 1787, there were nineteen.—No inhabitant of Amsterdam can be arrested for debt without being three times summoned, with the interval of a fortnight between each citation: nor can any arrest of person, or any execution, take place, till six weeks after the last summons. There is, however, an exception to this rule in cases of accepted bills of exchange, and when the debt is owing to a sentence of a court of justice for damages, and also when the debt is a rent payable on the first of May and November. In the two first of these cases, only one summons is necessary; and in the last, the three may take place in one day, and execution immediately follow. Strangers may at any time be arrested, upon the plaintiff’s swearing to the debt before the hooft ojjicier (or sheriff) who gives an order periculo petentis, to arrest the person of the debtor if he can be found in die street; for his own apartment in a private house is sacred, and cannot be forcibly entered, except by a deputation of the magistracy, called here the vollen gereebt, which consists of the hooft cfficier, two scheepens, their secretary, a messenger and constables. In a public house Ids ceremony is used; diough if a landlord were to refiife admittance, it is doubtful whether even here the officers could force an entry.— A man Handing on his steps on the outside of his door, may deride the officers who are patrolling before it, but who dare not touch him, while he Hands upon his own premiles.—

In Holland, burghers of established character, to whom the name of is given,

are chosen to determine any claims where the sum does not exceed two hundred guilders (about f18).—At several doors in Harlem I observed a small board put up with lace upon it, to lhew that'the mistress of the house was lying-in; and I was informed, that a disturbance near a house, thus guarded, would be severely punished, and that the husband could not at that time be arrested for debt.

In the Rqfp-boufey I found one day that all' the prisoners had finished their talk before

three o’clock, and on inquiring if they might not by continuing their work earn somewhat for themselves; one of them very pertinendy replied; “ No Sir; for I doubt if we had “ that permission, whether we should be so healthy as we are. The clolenefs of the court

At the new Work-house, over one of the outer gates, there is a device, with an inscription New work-to this purpose.

Fear not: I mean not vengeance, b reformation.

Severe is my band, but benevolent my intention.

The two rooms for the regents, and two for the governesses, at the front of die house, were very elegant and clean. In January 1787, there were three hundred and fifty persons lpinning in one long room. Some here, as in the old work-house, * were employed in boiling ropes and cables, and preparing them for oakum. — The women from the spin-house are removed hither, and I found the fame order and quietness here that I had formerly observed in that house. Forty women were at needle-work, and the mother presiding in the midst of them.—All the dormitories, except those for the criminals, were crow4ed with beds, each of which has a wooden partition, f In the infirmary the patients and rooms were so very dirty, that I did not wonder that persons are not readily

admitted to inspect them. A great degree of inhumanity, and abuse of trust, mufi be imputed

to the resident governor.

In the eight years preceding 1783, only five criminals had been executed in this city. J

From that time to January 1787, there had been only one criminal executed, and he was broken on the wheel. U The solemnity with which executions are performed may be

|| In Holland, there is no such thing as what is called in England king’s evidence; nor can any, except the fladtholder, promise impunity to one who discovers his accomplices. Nor is there any punishment to prisoners for an escape; though others, who break open a prison, are punishable with death.

one reason of their being so rare. I cannot help adding, that probably it is also in some measure owing to the Jolemnity of the administration of oaths, that perjury is not so frequent here as in some other countries. * — I could wish, from the clearest principles of reason and found policy, that the use of oaths, in almost all cases were abolished; and that the affirmation of die fad should be sufficient; and that he who asserted or affirmed a falsity, should be panished and disgraced as a perjurer.

In the Spin-house at Utrecht I found no alteration, except that the house was cleaner,

in consequence of the discharge of a negligent and wicked keeper.

There had been no execution for the city, or province, for twenty-four years preceding. January 1787. f

* The oath administered in Holland to those of the Jewi/h religion is expressed in the following words. “ You u swear by the Almighty and living God, who created heaven and earth, and gave his laws by Moses, that « you will be upright and true in whatever shall here be asked of, or proposed to you; and if you declare any thing either entirely, or in part, false and unjust, you acknowledge yourself liable to all the curses, plagues « and punishments, temporal and eternal, which the God of Israel inflicted on Sodom and Gomorrah, and on u Korah, Dathan and Abiram, and which he has denounced against all those who use or invoke his name falsely, and in vain. As you are true or false, so may God Almighty and Omniscient, reward or punish you.”

f The house of Dr. Brown, the worthy minister of the English church at Utrecht, having been lately burnt down during the service on a sunday; I asked him, whether such confusion and rapine took place there, as are usual in such cases in London: and he allured me, that on the contrary, the exa&eft order was observed, and that every thing was returned him which was taken out of his house.

The regulations with respett to fires are as follows. On the tower of the city, a watchman is constantly llationed, who is to look out every half hour; and if all be well, he is to play a tune on his trumpet; but if a fire appear, he is to blow an alarm, to ring a bell, and hang out a light pointed to that quarter where the fire is seen. The surrounding watchmen, thus alarmed, are immediately to alarm those nearest to them, and those others, till all the watchmen are alarmed; one of whom in each division is to call up the people (of whom and of the officer of the trained bands he has always a list) belonging to the fire-engine in his division, who are to convey it to the spot where the fire has broken out, and to receive a suitable reward according as their engine is the first, second, or third that arrives. This watchman is also to call up the officers and men of the trained bands of his division, who, together with the trained bands in the other divisions, the company on guard, and the burghers of the next division, are to surround the house on fire, and not to suffer any persons to approach it except those belonging to the engines, known by a token given them. The officers of the trained bands and those belonging to the engines are liable to heavy fines, if they do not make an immediate appearance upon the alarm; unless they can prove that the watchman, whose duty it was to alarm them, omitted it; in which case, he is obliged to pay the fine himself. All the houses in the neighbourhood are obliged to set lights in their windows, and to receive whatever goods shall be carried to them.

SCOTCH PRISONS AND HOSPITALS.

On my coming into Scotland in July 1787, the first county gaol I visited was at Ayr. There is no court, so that debtors and felons are never out of their rooms.

There is the fame defect in the Tolbooth at Glasgow. As the transports continue long in confinement, some alteration was making, by arching die rooms, in order to obtain greater security against escapes and disturbances.

Several of the transports were removed to a new adjoining to the poor-house.

Each had a separate room (about fix feet and a half by fix). The rooms here not being very strong, the prisoners had chains on their feet and necks. The passage being Only two feet eight inches wide, mod of the rooms were very offensive, and some very damp. — No endeavours are used to reclaim these unhappy objects j whose long ,

together with the great severity of their chains, and their scanty food (being only two pennyworth of bread in a day) mud reduce them to the extremity of misery and desperation.

The House of Correction is under the infirmary for the soldiers. Beside the keeper’s apartment, there is only one room, which is neither cieled nor white-washed. The women are entitled to whatever they can earn by their labour, and there were eleven of them spinning. But on Sundays, having no allowance or religious service, as the keeper informed me, they lie in bed.

The Tolbooth is in the Tower, has no apartments for the keeper, no court, no water, no sewers, and seems as if it was never white-washed: allowance to prisoners 4 d.a day.

1787, Aug. 3, Prisoners 4.*

In my former publication, I gave but a short account of the prisons at Edinburgh, because I then hoped from the spirited exertions of Mr. Steuart the late provost, that a new gaol would soon be built j but I am sorry to find his designs have been frustrated.

• I would not forget the favour the magistrates did me in presenting me with the freedom of the city, and so

politely accompanying me to the poor-house; and in their readiness to make any alteration for the benefit of their

fellow creatures. Yet, as several of the girls here, and at the poor-house in Glasgow, were employed in tambour

work.; I {hall beg leave to observe, that the employment of poor children in ornamental work ought never to be the

general mode; since if they are afterwards to come out into the world as common servants, or the wives of the

labouring poor, it will be found that a readiness in the ordinary and coarser kinds of female work, would have

been of much greater service than die acquirement of arts which diey have no time or occasion to practise.

I freely related my remarks to the Lord Provost, — that the Tolbooth stood in the fame improper place—that it had no court, and was not white-walhed—that the gaoler had no apartment in the prison-y-that he was suffered to sell spirituous and other liquors, * — and to serve the prisoners with their allowance of bread f — that his fees were high, J — and that he had no salary. || I added, that in the House Correction there were forty-seven women in three close rooms, some of them lying lick ■, * that no magistrate ever looked in upon them, and that no clergyman ever attended them,' or used any endeavours to reclaim them. He replied, " they were so hardened it could have no effect.” I differed in my opinion from his Lordship, and told him, that on seriously converting a few minutes widi several of them, I saw the tears in their eyes.—I further took the liberty to observe, that the splendid improvements carrying on in their places of entertainment, streets, squares, bridges, and the like, seemed to occupy all the attention of the gentlemen in office, to the total ne of this essential branch of the police:

• Whilkey is fold in the tolbooth at three-pence a gill; porter three-pence halfpenny a bottle; small beer one penny a bottle.—Carnish is paid by every civil debtor, viz. for oil to lamps two-pence; a pint and a half of whiikey Englifti measure one shilling and six-pence.

+ The prisoners at the tolbooth are served with halfpenny rolls. Aug. 5, 1787, weight, of the whitest, 4 ox* common fort, 6 oz. The rolls in the city weighed rather more, were better baked, and three fold for 1 \d. Some of the transports have been here upwards of two years: their allowance ir-eight halfpenny rolls a day, or threepence in money. One Thomas Gordon, who was respited, has been in this prison five years and ten months. I was informed, that not long fmee, a poor wretch under sentence of death was respited during his majesty's pleasure; but after sixteen months, he was brought out and executed.

A In every view salaries would be proper; and the keeper, clerks, and other servants would prefer them to their uncertain perquisites. In Feb. 1785, Thomas Dallas, a prisoner, presented a petition to the Lords of Council and Session, complaining of fas. The keeper in his answer uses these words: €€ He dedicates his u whole time to the duties of his office, and that was meant to yield an independent subsistence for him, although 4‘ by his appointment to the office he is burdened with annuities and unavoidable expenses to the amount of about w £ 70 sterling, yearly.”

Several of the women had been there upwards of a year, and knew not the term of their confinement. There was no separation between those who had been frequently committed, and those who had never before been in prison.

* Two of these very fck women were afterwards removed from their room, which was dirty and offensive, (about twelve feet by fix) into a spacious room in the poor-house, and by kind attention were soon in a way of recovery.

- for though, as a private person, I might not expert their regard to the remarks I had made in my repeated visits and publications; yet, I hoped they would have paid some deference to the opinion of the legislature, expressed in the humane and salutary clauses of the late atts of parliament; which, from the unaltered state of the prisons of this city, they seemed entirely to have disregarded.

In the State of the Prisons published in 1784, is inserted an account of the number of prisoners convicted of capital crimes in Scotland from 1768 to 1782. I shall give, at the end of the book, a list of the persons adjudged to capital punishments from ift of January 1783, to 20th of August 1787, as taken from the records. Table, No. 1.)

I frequently visited the Royal Infirmary, and could not but observe the want of a dietary in the wards, and that the patients are prohibited the use of those convenient baths that are in this hospital. The brick floors, which are general here, appear to me improper; as, by their hiding the dirt, they may prevent a due regard to cleanliness; and the many interstices

afford a lodgment for filth, which is not easily got out Irom them.

The Orphan Hospital is in a flourishing condition. Two wings are now added, by the generous contribution of Mr. Hod, the Treasurer; who abates not in his afiiduous attention.

I made several visits to the Charity Work-house, and found Ht clean, and a proper attention paid to the numerous inhabitants (584). When I was here four years ago, the house was in debt £ 2000, which is now increased to £ 4000. This is owing (except £ 1000 to Sir William Forbes and Co.) to the meal-men, butchers &C; so that instead of five per cent, interest, they probably pay fifteen or twenty. A proper representation of the state of the house was made to the magistrates in February 1787, by fix of the gentlemen managers, who had attentively examined the funds of the house j and they declared, that unless an effectual supply were provided, they were resolved to resign their charge.

There are many other charitable institutions in this city, which I omit to mention; but I shall take some notice of the neat, quiet, and comfortable retreat for old people; which has this inferipdon over the gate.

“ When this fabric was built is uncertain, but in the year 1567 it was made an Hospital “ for old People.—The fabric became in a great measure ruinous, and some parts of it un-“ inhabitable. In the year 1726 the reparations were begun, and fifteen new rooms added " by charitable donations—which will be supplied by old persons as the revenue is increased “ by donations.—£ 300 sterling entitles the donor to a presentation of a burgess,. widow " of a burgess, or child of a burgess, male or female. Ar.d £350 sterling gives the donor H a right to present any person whatsoever, not married, nor under fifty years of age.”

In this hospital, each person has his own room, eleven feet by eight and a half, in which is A cupboard and window. These rooms open into a passage twelve feet and a half wide, at the end of which is a fitting room, for such as choose to associate together. A chaplain reads prayers morning and evening. There is a garden, and other conveniences. They have roast meat three times a week, and boiled three times, and eleven bottles of good beer j’

coals, clothes and linen are also provided j but the allowance for walhing is only sixpence a month. The circumstance of each person’s having a window at command was very agreeable to me, as I have often observed, and lately at Norwich hospital for old ,where many lodge in the fame room, that the infirmity, or peevifliness of one person, has been the cause of half stifling the rest, for want of the admission of (that cordial of life) air.

SECTION , VI.

IRISH PRISONS AND HOSPITALS.

In 1787 and 1788, I visited the Prijons in Dublin, and all the County Gaols in Ireland; and had the pleasure to find that, in many places, gentlemen were attentive to this important part of the police. The grand juries have granted very liberal preferments, for the purpose of repairing or rebuilding their gaols, and for supplying prisoners with necessaries in sickness and health. On seeing gendemen so liberal and , I

could not but reflect with great concern, that many of the prisons now building will be monuments of the unjkiljulness of the architects, who are ignorant of what constitutes a secure and healthy prison.

The new gaols, having pompous fronts, appear like palaces to the lower class of people in Ireland j and some persons object against them on this account, especially those who are obliged to contribute towards their expense, and think it would be better if they were leys commodious; but if Jlrregulations were observed, and an act passed, absoluielyprohibiting beer, as well as all forts of spirituous liquors, from coming into

a prison -, and excluding visitants, except a few, and those at fixed times: then, there would be no danger of these gaols appearing too agreeable abodes j and the fear of such restraints would have a good tendency to prevent crimes; or the restraints themselves might be the means of reformation.

I flrall not enlarge in my description of the county gaols, as an Inspector-general of the prisons in Ireland is appointed, j- who is to make his report at the beginning of every

Their presence would, in a great measure, prevent improprieties, and promote order and regularity in those places.

At DUBLIN Newgate, there are no proper drains, no baths, no apartments for the Newgate. gaoler.—Many of the women lay on flag-stones, with a very little straw worn to dust. —

On the men’s fide, several boys, from nine to twelve years of age, were confined with the most daring offenders. — There are many instances of persons dying by intoxication and fighting: one lay dead when I was in the infirmary, and another was killed a few days after, f But the magistrates having determined to make an alteration in this prison, I doubt not but a proper separation of prisoners, and an obligation on the keeper to ref.de in the prison, will prevent many irregularities j especially as they now have the constant assistance of a worthy and attentive clergyman. At my last visit, there was plenty of water in both the courts, and the women’s court was paved.

I found the House of Industry, as formerly, very clean and orderly, and the governors, with unabated assiduity and zeal, attending to this ufefiil and humane institution. The bread and other provisions were very good. The governors have wifely adopted the Dutch mode of devoting the whole of Saturday to cleanliness, liich as walhing all the rooms, tables, forms, children &c. This is not only conducive to the health of the residents, but will promote in them habits of cleanliness.

Here also there had been a seene of confusion and riot the night before, which had brought hither the sheriff, with the city guard, who conveyed three of the prisoners to Newgate. The wives and children of the debtors, living with them, bring in spirits, and this makes mod of the lower rooms gin {hops: J to which may be added, that the prisoners themselves are quite idle and unemployed.

• Mr. Dexter the marshal told me, he was well allured from the bell information, that when his prison wai full, a hogshead of whilkey had been fold in a week, in a clandestine manner, beside what was fold from his own tap.

f It may be thought severe and cruel, especially to debtors, who are not delinquents, that no liquors should be admitted into prilbns. But, though the greatest tenderness should be shewn to such unfortunate persons, yet the rellraint appears neccessary; for many sober persons coming into prison, from uneasiness of mind, and the influence of bad examples, have acquired those habits which ended in their ruin: and, the quiet and orderly frequently complain of being dillurbed by the noisy and quarrelsome. It appears therefore absolutely necessary, that a new body of rules and orders be fixed by parliament, for the government of debtors, as well as felons, in all prisons. And that not even felons, much less debtors, should be left to the capricious mandates of an insulting gaoler or his turnkeys.

x Dr. Scott, physician to the marshalseas, informed me in June 1787, that he had juA loA three men out of four, by excessive drinking, in the city marshalsea. They had one morning drunk twelve shillings worth of brandy in punch, beside porter and other liquors.

I shall also give a Sketch of the state of some of the Infirmaries or Hospitals in Ireland.

Mercers* Hospital, in the middle of the city, was a few year's since very dirty, offensive and unhealthy; but now it is one of the cleanest in Dublin. The wire-lattice in the windows of the wards and passages is an improvement. The tellers of the beds are harbours for dull.’ Apertures in the wards (as in the infirmary at Leeds) and more frequent white-walhing would contribute to the recovery of the patients.

In Stephens’s Hospital the wards are close and offensive j the windows were shut when the days were fine. The indiscriminate admission of visitants is highly improper, especially of men into the women’s wards, and more particularly, where the beds, as here, are enclosed with wood and curtains, j-

I’ have seen a person come for admission to this hospital, when the effects of the frequent use of spirituous liquors have appeared by the dropsical water forcing itself through the pores of his Ikin. J

Simpson’s

# Many persons in this city, in order to have the benefit of an insolvent aft, come to prison under friendly mSlionsy and having brought friends, who give the keepers security for the debts, are not confined: yet, after an insolvent aft, the keepers make their return on oath that such persons are in aSual custody.

f All hospitals should have set days for visitants, and only two in a week (as at the Royal Hospitals at Plymouth and Gosport): the nurse, and proper persons, should always be present to preserve order and quietness. The regulations should be put up in every ward, and the nurses immediately discharged for any 'neglect, or impropriety.

% In almost every village in Ireland, there are several public houses for the sale of spirituous liquors; and when gentlemen, from a regard to the morals and health of their domestics and tenants, have applied to prevent licenses to such houses, the publicans have obtained them from the commissioners of excise in Dublin, because the means of increasing the revenue.

IRELAND, Spct. VI,

Simpson’s Hospital for the blind and gouty, is excellent institution. The rooms are neat and clean j and the committee board is w$ll ^tended. The patients are kindly supr plied with newspapers for their amusement} but are, , indulged in the idle habit

of taking tobacco and snuff, each having an allowance of four-pence a week for that purpose. The kitchen and offices being, improperly, under ground, were dark and not clean. The greatest attention to cleanliness is the more necessary where offices are under ground.

In St. Patrick’s or Swift's Hospital for Lunatics, the rooms (twelve feet by eight) are lofty, and the passages fourteen feet wide. Yet for such unhappy objects, I would prefer die Dol-buis at Amsterdam, and the Hospital at Constantinople, where the rooms open into corridors and gardens, which is for better than their opening into passages, as here, and in England.

The Lyinc-in Hospital is a good institution; the rooms in 1787 were quiet and clean: and in 1788,1 found tjid tellers removed, the furniture new, and the greatest attention paid to the patients.

In the Foundling Hospital children are received at all times. * A noble institution, if there were more attention to cleanliness and order. No fixed hours for meals.—The lfoen brown:—white is more proper in such houses.—On viewing the children in 1787, I soon perceived the effects of the loss of lady Arabella Denny’s visits, an excellent lady, who for many years pad great attention to this hospital.—In 1788 I fow many fine children, and the girls were neatly clothed, but several had eruptions on their hands.

« the diet of persons exposed to the causes of this disease; and due deference ought certainly to be paid to their " knowledge and experience: but, convinced as I am, that art never made so fatal a present to mankind as the « invention of distilling spirituous liquors, and that they are seldom or never a necessary, but almost always a “ pernicious article in the diet of men in health, I cannot but look with peculiar satisfaction on the confirmation

* this opinion receives by the events in these narratives.

“ The temporary glow and elevation caused by spirituous liquors are, I imagine, very fallacious tokens of M their good effects; as they are always succeeded by a greater reverse, and tend rather to consume and cx- hauft, than to feed and invigorate, the genuine principle of vital energy. Another extremely pernicious effect « of these liquors, is, the indolence and stupidity they occasion, rendering men inattentive to their own preserva- tion, and unwilling to use those exertions which are so peculiarly necessary in situations like those described in

* the foregoing narratives.’*

* Foundling Hospitals may be considered in two lights; one as charities for the maintenance and education of poor deserted children, who otherwise might fall victims to ill treatment and neglect. The other, as means to prevent child-murder, by providing a refuge against the shame and disgrace attending the discovery of* illegitimate pregnancy. For both these purposes it is requisite that admiifion into such hospitals should be easy; but, particularly for the latter, it is essential that it may be obtained without any form, or delay, and in perfect furecy. It is another question whether such institutions may not do more harm than good, by encouraging licen-tioufnefs; but certainly they cannot prevent the murder of children unless the mothers can get rid of the charge without discovery. Those hospitals, therefore, in which admission is made very difficult, and only to be obtained by powerful interest and recommendation, seem to me absolutely useless, and only to serve as a provision for the boards of gentlemen, or of such as by their connections have no need of public relief!

The vault bad. The windows in the passage not capable of being opened. The children have no vegetables of any kind with their food.—»

By the constant use of meat, they are habituated to a very expensive diet. When I objected to this mode of living, the reply was, “ Our children are healthy and well.” But-they are neither healthier nor finer boys, than those in the Hibernian school, where a very different mode of diet is adopted: for there the extensive garden is appropriated to the cultivation of vegetables for the children.

Hospital Ior Incurables. Both outside and inside dirty:—the rooms offensive :—no rulesno diet table:—the house-keepCr in'the country; The mistresses of such houses’ should never be permitted to be absent.

Military Hospital. I observed in my former publication that the military hospital was- Military an old and incommodious building, and that the patients were almost stifled; but I had the pleasure to find in 1788, that a spacious and airy infirmary, adjoining to the Phoenix Park, was nearly finished} and I hope the fine stream of water will be brought under the building; which, by forcing pumps, may prevent the closets and drains from being offensive, and the baths may then be well supplied in a receiving room, for washing the patients on their admission, similar to the practice in the royal hospitals at Plymouth and Gosport.

Till lately, the apothecary had been^ allowed a year for making up the medicines, and was to furnish the drugs at prime cost: but his bills, in 1786 amounting to £ 100, the governors have since thought proper to order the drugs to be bought in Dublin, and, having medicinal herbs in their own garden, they have ordered the surgeon (who is paid the king’s £ 100) to make up the medicines.

The upper falhes in this, and indeed in almost all the county infirmaries, are not moveable as they ought to be. There were twelve beds with good bedding and sheets, enclosed improperly in boxes, though the boxes were somewhat larger than' in other infirmaries. Diet 2| din white bread, and three pints of new milk a day. The funds are under £300 per annum. Till lately, the apothecary had been allowed a year for making up the medicines, and was to furnish the drugs at prime cost: but his bills, in 1786 amounting to £ 100, the governors have since thought proper to order the drugs to be bought in Dublin, and, having medicinal herbs in their own garden, they have ordered the surgeon (who is paid the king’s £ 100) to make up the medicines. The expense therefore in 1787 fell considerably below £40. This infirmary enjoys the benefit of an annual ball, which in 1787 produced £ 40: 5: 6.- May ad, 1788, 12 Patients.

KILKENNY County arid- City Gaols. Ih the County Gaol there were fbme Kilkenny. improvements, and it was white-washed, and cleaner than at my former visits; but still there are dungeons, and the windows are towards the street. Here I saw a neat little woman, who was committed for assisting her husband when he was fighting and had his jaw-broken. Bread allowance two-pence a day. I carefully weighed the twopenny loaves of both the prisons (which are served by the fame baker) and found the weight on June 9, 1787,. one pound and three ounces. By the last assize, on the 23d of the preceding mondi, the weight ought to have been one pound ten ounces and two drams. A fourpenny loaf of household-bread in the city, whiter and better than that in the prison, weighed three pounds and one ounce; but by the assize, it should have weighed three pounds four ounces and four drams. To prevent such abuses, it was enacted 3d of Geo. III.

The county proposes to build a new gaol: I hope not on the old ground, though it adjoins to the court-house; as, at a little distance, the place where the old barracks stood is spacious, and has every advantage for the site of a county gaol, being airy and near the river, and has a well offine water.

About a week before my last visit, seven prisoners unrivetted the bolts with which they were ironed, and having made with them an aperture in the wall, effected their escape.

I havq often complained that these bolt irons are so much used in Ireland, as they are very painful to the prisoners, and dangerous instruments when they get them off, which is done without much difficulty.

By a late act this hospital has a presentment from the county of £ 200 a year. The drugs for the patients are bought in Dublin, and paid for by the treasurer of the hospital. I would just submit to the attention of these gentlemen, whether removing the wood tellers of the beds, and making windows in the wards, for producing a better circulation of air, opposite to those with which they are already furnished, would not render this infirmary more favourable to the health of the patients.

The Bridewell at Mitchells Town is a new built by Lord Kingsborough. It wants lime-whiting, and the windows are towards the street. Here was lately a sickness among die prisoners, which, I apprehend, was occasioned by the very offensive sewers in the rooms, and the want of a court and water. April nth, 1788, No prisoners.

• « It is the opinion of Dr. Arbuthnot% that renewing and cooling the air in a patient’s room, by opening the bed curtains, door, and windows, in some cases letting it in by pipes, and in general the right management of air in the bed-chamber, is among the chief branches of regimen in inflammatory diseases, provided dill that the intention of keeping up a due quantity of perspiration be not disappointed., And Dr. Fordyce adds, “ By the officious and mistaken care of filly nurses in this respect, the disease is often increased and lengthened, or even proves fatal.—Numberlefs indeed are the mischiefs which arise from depriving the patient of cool air; the changing of which, so as to remove the putrid steams, is mod of all necessary in putrid diseases.” —I hope I shall be excused in adding, “ In the beginning of putrid fevers (and many putrid fevers come upon a full habit) the patient abhors, without knowing the reason, foods which easily putrify, but pants after acid drinks And fruits; and such are allowed by some physicians who follow nature. Oranges, lemons, citrons, grapes, peaches, currants, ne&arines, are devoured with eagerness and gratitude. Can the distillery or the apothecary’s shop boad of such cordials ?—It appears then on the whole, that the food in a putrid fever should consist of barley, rice, oatmeal, wheat bread, sago, falop, mixed with wine, lemon, orange, citron, or chaddock juice, jellies made of currants and other acescent fruits; and when broths are thought absolutely necessary, which probably happens but seldom, they should be mixed with currant jellies, citron, lemon, and orange juices.”

t I had the pleasure to hear that the worthy Mayor of Cork, Samuel Rowland Esq. with the concurrence of the corporation, has abolished the two annual dinners on the election, and swearing-in days, of the chief magistrate and sheriffs, which were the occasion of much irregularity; and substituted in lieu thereof a permanent and mod useful charity, to be supported by the money formerly expended therein, amounting in the whole to £ 200. This annual sum is to be disposed of by trustees for the relief of indigent freemen, their wives and children; and there is reason to hope that it will receive a future augmentation by bequeds and donations.

The prison is now supplied by Mr. Tyrrell, and he said that the account for the year 1787 would not exceed £ 90, though the number of prisoners was greater than usual. His account of the winter half year, from August 1786 to March 1787, amounted only to £46: 11: 5I. The county is building a new gaol on a fine spot, and a stream runs through the court; yet I fear it is on too small a scale for solitary confinement at night; as the gaoler said, that the last assize he had forty-two criminals. And I have a much greater difiike to the confinement of two in a cell, than to the crowding of many into one room.

The boys were clean, but their clothes and linen in rags. The old men were crowded into two rooms, and lay two in a bed—they were Ihivering with cold, fuel not being allowed after March 25th. There were fifteen cows for the house, and a fine trad of land in the front—yet the boys and men were scantily supplied with milk, potatoes and greens. Having heard the boys of different (landings read, I am persuaded they have an attentive school-master. Hi# salary is 25 Guineas a year.—A refidcat clergyman is allowed £150. The steward’s salary is only 20 or £30, but I saw by the annual account he was a creditor for £1969: 15: 7 in one sum. April 25th, 1788, there were only sixty-nine boys and eighteen men.

LONGFORD County Gaol. A bad prison. Dungeons about four feet under ground: windows towards the street s passage dark, three feet five inches wide. A prisoner, committed for only a month, was lately detained here several months for his fees, amounting to £i: io: 3. In this, and similar instances, the expense of the bread allowance to prisoners exceeds the amount of the fees.—A presentment has been made for building a new gaol. I found one of the finest spots for that purpose, on a declivity, near the

river, clear of mod buildings, near the sessions house, and adjoining to the barracks.

Longford County Infirmary is in the barrack yard. The wards were full of fmoke— beds crowded—bedding worn out—no water. The surgeon is paid the £ 100 per am. from the king’s letter; the governors now buy the drugs in Dublin j and, though they have double the number of beds, the-expense is not half so great as when they paid an' apothecary. April 24th, 1788, 16 Patients.

CAVAN County Gaol, lately built. — No court, though a convenient area is contiguous. ;—Water from a well oh the outside,. into which I saw the rain-water run from the street.—The rooms Very dirty and offensive}—never white-washed. Prisoners double bolted. The bar-bolts are cruel j for they give more pain to the prisoners when lying or walking than iron chains. — Windows closed for fear of tools being conveyed. Here I cannot but remonstrate against the negligence of inspectors* and gaolers, and their idle excuses for the omission of washing prisons, on which the health of the prisoners so much depends. The gaoler lives at a distance j salary £ 20. But by a shameful neg-left, neither his salary, nor the fees for acquitted prisoners have been paid him, for four or five years.

t The local inspector, in his report relative to the subject of preventing prisoners from receiving spirituous liquors, properly observes: “ This is complied with as far as it is in the power of the inspector, but he cannot answer but that liquors may be conveyed by the windows, as they conhfl of iron grates, and open to the dreeis.”

CHARTER SCHOOLS IN IRELAND.

In Ireland there are thirty-eight Charter Schools, designed for the instruction of the children of the popish and other poor natives in the English tongue, and the principles of loyalty and true religion i besides two called the Ranelagh Schools, which. , admit only the children of protestants.

In two journeys into Ireland, some years since, I looked into several of these schools,. carrying with me the account of them published at the end of the last sermon that had been then preached to the society. I afterwards waited on the committee of fifteen in Dublin, and having reported various apparent abuses, some alterations were made. But I am folly persuaded that this noble charity (till gready wants a reformation, and a parliamentary inquiry for that purpose.

Some general observations on these schools were given in my publication in 1784; but having visited many of them in .1787, and made a report to the committee of the House of Commons in 1788 ■, and afterwards, in an extensive tour, visited several more of these schools j I shall now give a particular account of them.

£ 24 Irish j besides £30 for three maid-servants. At my visit in 1788 I saw a report of the local committee expressing that the boys’ shoes were in a “ terrible state; the dockings-“ miserably bad, so that in one week they were worn out j their clothes made of the worst “ materials, and infamously tacked together.” March iotli, 1788,. 66 Boys..

The following is a copy of the report of the Rev. Mr. , " I must however again « repeat, that the master of Castlebar school appears to have been very inattentive to their “ education, to fend girls, most of whom are from fifteen to eighteen years of age from « under his care, so very ill-informed in every branch of their education.” Several of these girls could not read. — Removals have been made in several of the schools that the boys and girls may be separate.

Kilkenny School. June 9, 1787, thirty-three boys.—Much cleaner than at my former visits: — rules and orders hung up. — In the infirmary no beds.—Salary to the master £ 6, and mistress £6.* * The servant’s wages and diet, only £ 5. Soap and candles £ 5. Fuel £ 7. The master. and mistress pay 15 s.a year for the work of each child, but

complain of losing by such a charge. Annual allowance for the clothing of each child was £ 1 5:0. Here is a good ulher, at eight guineas a year. I found the following report in the book: “ April 8, 1788, the boys being afflicted with a Ipotted fever occa-* fions us not to meet at the school as usual.” My visit having been made a few days after the date of this report, I am persuaded that such caution was needlels.

June 10, 1787, fifty-two boys. —The house and rooms perfectly clean; as also the children, though many in rags, f — Employment, spinning cotton and linen.—The master and mistress here also complained of losing by the work, for which they pay as at Kilkenny school.—No ulher: — the mistress and her daughter were teaching the little children to read. —Salary to the master and mistress £ 6 each.—Premium £ 8; for in this and other schools premiums or bounties are sometimes given as an encouragement to those who seem most attentive. Allowance only 20a year for fuel, soap- and candles, and £3:2:6 for the diet of each, child.

The society, for some years, because the price of oatmeal exceeded eight killings an hundred, made a imall addition to the allowance of this, and some other schools: but at 3 general quarterly meeting on Wednesday, August 3d, 1785, it was resolved that no such allowance should be continued.

At

• In the Charter Schools, the salary to the mailer and his wife is a year each, besides allowance for diet, the fame as for a child. Where there is only a mistress, the salary is a year with'a like allowance.

N. B. In the accounts of allowance, the money mentioned always signifies Irish.

£1:1:8 Irish is only one pound English; 13 Irish equal to- a shilling English.

f It seems that the influence of cleanliness is extensive; for the cabins near this house were the cleaned and neatest I ever faW'in Ireland.

t This resolution was sent to the mailers of all the charter schools:

These foods are to be given alternately to the children when they can be " had reasonably, and varied every meal, or every day or every week, as the local committees foall find cheapefo.-“ and mod for the convenience of the mailer. And then the allowance for each child one with another, as to « the quantity of provisions weekly, wiH be as follows;

" Eight pounds and three quarters of wheat or oatmea],

" Eight quarts and three half pints of milk or beer,

" One pound and a quarter or twenty ounces of flesh meat.

« Wten die price of wheat or oatmeal grows high, then the children are to be entirely fed upon which ever of "them is cheapest, and as the society never refofe to advance money to the mailers on the representation of the '< local committees, when provisions may be had cheap, it is expelled that the mailers wiH endeavour to keep " down the price of provisions. Resolved, that such allowance as is directed by the dietary, for each child, « be made for each and every of the following persons, when they are appointed by the society to be kept in " each of the schools, (that is to lay) mailer, mistress, and usher, over and above their respe&fare salaries. «* Resolved, that the present allowance for cloathing of each child, be encreased from twenty Ihillingi yearly "to twenty-five shillings.

Allowance for soap and candles only £ 5. On application to the local committee for allowance for necessaries, the answer ■was, “ the society is poor; they cannot afford it” The last report in the book was June jflr, 1785. At my last visit 1 found this school in much better order:—the bed rooms were clean. — By hearing several of the boys read, I was convinced that proper attention is now paid to that important part of their education.—The society’s clothes are so very bad, that if the boys be not clothed again before Christmas, they must be almost naked.

« At a general meeting of the Incorporated Society Sec, 15th April 1788. w Resolved, that the allowance for feeding the several persons in the charter schools be encreased to three-pence a day for each person; said encreased allowance to take place from the 15th of May next.” In this letter a fort of dietary was ordered, and the hours of meals fixed.

From z^th of March to 29th of September• Breakfast half pall eight. Dinner one.

From 29th of September to z$tb of March, Breakfast half pall nine.

I could wish that children were always accustomed to early hours. Breakfast, in the summerhalf year, should not be later than half pad seven, nor in winter than eight: the hour of dinner even in nuinter should be one; and for supper fix. By the present allowance, if the mailers do justice to the children, they will now be properly fed.

f Dr. Lind, in his ninth fe£lionon the Preservatives of Health on board ships, fays, u That by cold bathing « in warm weather the body is cooled and refreshed, the fibres braced and invigorated, so that the men become w afterwards better enabled to undergo the fatigues and heat of the day. This would prove not only an excel-u lent means of health, but of cleanline fa; by cleansing the (kin, and invigorating the whole habit, it is so far u from flopping the perspiration in hot weather, that it promotes it.

“ I can affirm, from my own experience in hot climates, that fluxes and many other complaints have not only “ been cured by cold bathing, but the return, and even the attack, of such dileafes, effectually prevented by it.” He adds, * I am persuaded that the remarkable healthfulness of the Tyger ship of war, was more owing to the uft of the fold bath, than to any other circumstance.

It seems from the book, that none of the

local committee had visited this house since August 1785. In 1788 I found this school in much better order, and the rooms cleaner than in 1787. May 10th, 1788, 2.5 Girls, 15 Boys.

Dundalk School. July 21ft, 1787, forty girls. The house clean, but the children seemed by their countenances to be scandly fed: pantry empty.—Allowance now two-pence halfpenny a day. —Linen wanted: no towels: no table cloths: only one sheet on a bed. Here, and at a few other schools, there is no land.

Strangford School. July 23d, 1787, twenty boys. Children healthy: here they have the advantage of frequently bathing in the sea. — Salary to matter and mistress £ 12: maid-servant £ 5: soap* and candles £ 5: coals £ 14. The infirmary is used as a stable.

Castlelar School is situated on a fine eminence just out of the town. No pump: no vault. Sept. i2di, 1787, the matter received from the Dublin nursery five girls, and from that of Monaftereven nine, several of them without shoes or stockings. At my visit March 31ft, 1788, there were twenty girls, and the number had not been greater for a year past; though in the account which the society last published, the number on the 29th of Sept. 1787 is stated forty-one.—Thefe children were puny, sickly objects, almost naked; seven had scald heads, and almost all the itch. With these disorders they camej and having no clothes but such as were in rags, the apothecary was afraid to give them physic. The matter said they could not earn him a halfpenny. They had never been at church since they came. The following is an extra# from a letter font to the society in Dublin, signed by fix gentlemen of the local committee and the surgeon — “ 2d of Nov. 1787.

The clothes of the 12th of June are of so bad a quality that the children who have been “ here since Nov. 1786 are now naked, and unable to attend the church. A set of “ fheeting is much wanted.” No answer to this was received from the society at Dublin till the Friday before my visit, and then only a printed receipt for the cure of scald heads.— In the society’s accounts, published for several years, it is said, * This school was endowed u by Lord Lucan with two acres, plantation measure, rent free in perpetuity; and a lease “ of twenty acres more, like measure, for three lives, at a pepper-corn yearly.” On reading this to the matter, he said, he never heard of more than about eight acres, which were in his possession.

Ballinrobe School.March 31ft, 1788, twenty-five boys. Fourteen of these came from the nursery at Monaftereven, and eight from that of Dublin, in a sickly state. — Mott of them were eight years old, yet did not know a letter: now they are fine healthy boys, and great attention is paid to them by the Rev. Mr. Viridite the visitor. — The boys having no place for their diversions except the spot of ground before the door, and the house adjoining being a popish chapel, this spot, and also the garden, should be enclosed by a wall. The children in these schools are continually jifibciating with the matter’s labourers and others in the kitchen j and therefore it seems that little benefit can be derived

• I have in these remarks seldom omitted to mention the allowance for soap, that necessary article of dean* liness, because it is too small in these schools; and this is an inducement to preserve the urine for waihing tht children’s linen, which is one cause of cutaneous disorders.

from them in those counties where all the neighbours are Roman-Catholics. Allowance, for soap and candles only £ 3: fuel £ 15: for mending windows 5 — No water:

no vault.

Galway School. April ift, 1788, twenty-two boys; one an idiot.—All had shoes and stockings; but in general they did not look healthy, which might be owing to their late recovery from the measles.—Allowance for soap, candles and turfj only 14 a year.— No towels.— The house in good repair, but wanted white-washing. This is a good iituation for a bath.

Loughrea School. April 3d, 1788, forty girls. These dirty, sickly objects, without shoes and stockings, were (pinning and knitting in a cold room paved with pebbles. The usher flood (as at some other schools) with a rod in his hand, to fee the children work; but there was not a book to be seen. There were only sixteen beds—fheets much wanted — the infirmary, a potatoe house. —The children were sadly neglected by their drunken mistress. ^But I observed that her own children, by the fire fide, were fresh and clean.

To this school, where there are only girls, there belongs much arable land. Here, at Calllebar, and at some other schools, the farm-yards are dole to the back doors, and so dirty that one can hardly stir out.

Newmarket School. April 4th 1788, eighteen girls and fourteen. boys. The rooms clean—white linen on the beds—the children clean, and free from dilorders. The mailer does not live in the school-house.

Shannon Grove School. April 5th, 1788, eighty-seven children. Here as at Newmarket, Castle Martyr, Castle Island, Sligo, and some other schools, boys and girls are intermixed, which on many accounts is improper. The house was badly built, and is so much out of repair that part of it mull be taken down, f The bed rooms were clean; the children dirty; but seemed to be properly fed. The boys were spinning, an employment which can be of little advantage to them when they are grown up; and the confinement within doors, with the waste of saliva by moillening the flax, make it unhealthy, and give them a pale or fallow complexion. The church is about two miles distant. — Here, and at several other schools, I found some leaves of the visitors’ book torn out.

• At Galway and Ennis I visited the schools of Erasmus Smith's foundation, which are well conduced, and provided with able matters. With the worthy matter of the former, the Rev. Mr. Campbell, I had much convention relative to a more general and liberal mode of education in that country. Mr. Campbell testified the veadinefs of many of the catholics to fend their children to protettant schools; and he is of opinion that many would by these means be brought over, were the most promising of them enabled, by moderate aids, to pursue their further education in the university. It might also be adviseable to remove from the charter schools some of the most improved children to these schools, or such provincial ones as might be established.

f The school-houses in general are good strong buildings, on a proper plan, and well adapted to the purpose.

Castle Island Schoolj April 8th, 1788, eleven girls and ten boys. The rooms clean: the children not dirty, but kept too close to work, and scantily fed. — Formerly their learning was neglected, but now they have a careful visitor.

About three acres of the land belonging to this school was taken away in die time of the late matter, as he informed the present matter: of this the society has not yet taken any notice. — In the postscript of a letter to the matter, 25th of July 1787, are these words,

* Do not draw at less than thirty-one days fight.” But the matter told me he could readily have got the money for the bills at a shorter date.

KilfinaneSchool. April 10th, 1788, nineteen girls, all neat and clean, spinning and few-ing. — The mistress was allowed for the clothing of each £1:5:0. They had shoes and stockings, brown stuff gowns with yellow sleeves, white caps and bibs, and check aprons. This is the best charter school for girls that I have seen. The house is inconvenient.—No vault, f

Cashell School.April 12th, 1788, forty boys. The bed rooms offensive: clay floors. The kitchen, in which the children dine and sup, is dark, and has a floor of dirt. Allowance only for one maid: no usher. — The children neat, but the matter justly complained of the shoes and stockings, and that the shirts were too fmallj the clothes poor and flight, and the breeches too short

Castledermot School. April 15th, 1788, twenty-seven boys. The report of the local

committee on the 14th of April 1788 (the day immediately preceding my vilit) was, that “ the children are all well, except one sick of the ague, and the house clean:” but I observed that some had scald heads; and the mistress acknowledged that eight of them had that disorder. The rooms were dirty. On each of the eight beds there was only one , Iheet, and on the other bedsteads hardly any bedding. The house out of repair — the walls very dirty — the children sadly neglected — the matter only seventeen or eighteen years of age. No diet table; nor had the mistress, as she told me, ever heard of any. She enjoys an annuity of £ 10 a year, from a estate left to the incorporated society by John . 'Rogerfon Esq. of Bettifield.

Stradbally School. April 15th, 1788, forty-nine fine healthy boys. The bed room* clean, and furnished with sheets and proper bedding: but no usher, and only one maid-servant. — Allowance for soap and candles £ 5 j and only 5 a year for mending the widows of this large house.

• I shall here beg leave to put two or three queries to the Trustees of Erasmus Smith's charity schools, relative to this county, i. Is not a sum of money allowed by them for a school in the isle of Valentia, in the county of Kerry i z. How is it applied ? 3. Is not a blacksmith the nominal mailer ? 4. Is not the late Mr. Fit*gtral4*+ house the school-house ? 5. Is not the salary continued to his executors for the use of his children

■f I visited a small girls’ school of Lady Kingjborcugb's at Mitchells Town, where the house and children were sweet and clean. The girls were neatly clothed in brown camlet gowns. They lhe\vcd5 both by their reading and their work, that great attention is paid to them. It is probable that the mistress at Kilfinane has seen this school# and I wilh it were regarded in some rcipe&s as a model for other charter schools*

I found

I found this id 178a one of the best schools for boys. The worthy clergyman Mr. Fofier is. still assiduous in his attention to them. Formerly the boys were well clothed by the master j but at the time of my visit, he had just received an inferior fort of clothes from the society. These clothes should have been sent on the 20th of January. On the 3d of April* no clothes having arrived, thirteen gendemen of the local committee resigntd their trust, in a letter sent by Lord Roden to the committee of fifteen.

Sligo School. April 20th* 1788, twenty-four boys and thirteen girls. The house finely situated;—but it seemed to me that the children are not properly fed, and that there is too little attention given to their morals and behaviour. Here were only three cows: the home close was ploughed, and part of the garden sown with wheat. The late Adam Ormjhy Eiq. bequeathed £35 per annum for ever, towards the support of this school* out of his estates j but for several years no payment has been made.

Farr a School. April 25th, 1788, twenty-five boys. The house, bed rooms, and children very dirty: theii*clothes in rags: water too distant: their countenances shew their sickly state. *—Many of them so young that the charge for their labour is a heavy burden on the master, and fornifhes him with an excuse for pinching them in their diet.

Ardbraccan School, -j- April 25th, 1788, forty-three boys crowded into one room which is too small. The house also is too small for the number which, in the printed

* I am persuaded, if the inspectors took proper care that attention should be paid to deanliness, that the beds should not be crowded, and that the sick should be sent to the infirmary room, the children would be much more healthy, and there would be little occasion for medicines.

■f When I visited this school in 1782, and compared its state with the society’s account of their schools pub-Jiihed in 1781, the master informed me, that his school had greatly suffered by an exchange of part of his land for the convenience of the reftor. I viewed the ground, and was then fully persuaded of the injury done to the charity. In 1788 I carefully reviewed those parts of the land which had been exchanged, and am confirmed in my opinion, that neither to accommodate the rector, nor to oblige the bishop of Meath, that unjust, and (if the society’s account of their title to the land published in 1781 were truly Hated I) illegal exchange should have been made by die incorporated society. The land taken from the society'being contiguous to their other fields, had been endofed, by the late masterj and it was near three acres (Irish) more than that which they received in exchange.

The house was clean, and the children in health, but badly clothed.—The bread very bad.—A pump of fine water.— No infirmary.—Extract from a report in the book; “7th October 1786.

Castle Carbery School. April 26th, 1788, thirty-seven girls. Many of them were making lace (fee note in p. 75). The walls of the rooms very dirty—children not clean— several had fore heads—no infirmary. The bad state of this school might in a great measure be owing to the matter who was lately difmjfled, for I was informed, that half the children were then almott naked.—There having been many removals of matters lately made, the sickly appearance of the children which I observed in some schools, did not always proceed from the neglect or inattention of the matters or miftrefies who had the management of the schools at the time I visited them.

. Maynooth School. April 26th, 1788, thirty-five fine healthy boys. The house, bed rooms, and bedding perfectly clean. Ten or twelve boys were at work in the garden, which contains about three acres (Irish), and is kept in the nicest order by the matter and his boys, f Allowance for diet 3 d.a day. No infirmary; which is less necessary where boys are thus employed.

fed; but little attention is paid to cleanliness; several had scald heads.—Allowance for soap and candles only £ 5.—The society’s clothes were in rags. Extract from the

• If the society’s funds are too low for the proper support of all the schools, would it not be better that some were supprefled ? And if the suppression of any be necessary, they should be those which are attended with the moll inconveniences— such as the inconveniences attending a house out of repair, and a bad supplyof water; and those arising from situations too remote from the capital, and a church, or where the neighbours are all Roman-Catholics, and there is little probability of a proper inspection. I will add that if any should be supprefled, the children might be sent to some of the bell schools where the numbers are deficient.

f The boys in all the schools should be taught to plant, fow, rear trees Sec, proper utensils for this purpose should be provided for them by the society, and a part of every garden should be set apart as a nursery for their inftrn&ion.

Leinster Nursery, at Monaftereven. June 25th, 1787, there were seventy-eight children. Their ages, as in Miltown nursery, from two to six years.

April 16th, 1788, there were seventy-five children, all crowded into one room or hall; the room opposite to it, and intended for a school or dining-room, being used only for a bake-house. The children very dirty, and their hair not kept properly combed. Fourteen or fifteen had scald heads, though in these nurseries, the society allows a maid fervapt for every ten children. Many whose ages were from two to four years were loaded with heavy and improper clothing. The youngest children are allowed only three meals a day. At the time I visited them they were dining at three o’clock on potatoes, not properly boiled: five or six of the most sickly dined on a piece of new half-baked cake or bread; but the drink of all of them was four butter-milk. The matter (who thinks he understands physic) gives, as he fays, to every child, sulphur and-milk in the morning, and intends to anoint them all for the itch.

Six had died the last quarter of 1787; nine since j and there were fourteen in the infirmary. The allowance for diet now being i a day, I hope the children will no longer be fed with skimmed milk.

Remarks

on

Charter

Schools.

IRELAND, Sbct.VIT,

To the remarks I hare already made on the Charter. Schools which I viilted, k will not be improper to add the following hints for their improvement.

In the diet table the quantity and quality should be fixed for every day in the week.— The master and mistress should attend the children at their meals, and dine within half an hour of their time, that the business of the house be not interrupted, and late hours introduced among the children.—The regulations for mailers—children—and servants, should be printed on a board and hung up} and the bdl rung at the times of rising, prayers, meals &c.

To every fifteen children there should be one maid-servant; and in large schools, there should be a cook, who ought also to manage the dairy. The whole of Saturday should be appropriated to cleanliness. There should be a larger allowance for , llarch, candles and fuel; and proper utensils for cleaning the rooms.—The children’s linen constantly changed twice a week.—A crib bedstead for every two children at most, and single beds for the sick children. In the mailer’s or mistress’ bed room a window to look into the children’s dormitory. An infirmary in every house, with beds and proper bedding kept neat.—Every house once a year to be lime-whited, that is, waihed with boiling water in which fresh lime-Jlcne has been flaked. * The sashes of the windows both upper and under should be moveable.—A dairy and pantry in every house: a pump is necessary: a convenient bath: a proper vault with separations: the master to keep only one dog: no pigs nor fowls ever to enter the house.—The master and mistress to accompany the children to and from church, and fit with them there.— The time for the children’s work not to exceed four hours a day, and the mailers and * mistresses not to be charged for it.—Large and neat gardens for a supply of vegetables, instrudion and work for the boys.—The girls to be employed in {pinning and knitting, in

. # I have often mentioned the want of lime* whiting in the prisons, hospitala and schools in this country, whea they appeared to me very dirty; as it is attended with little expense, is exceedingly salutary, and tends to inspire young persons in particular with a love of cleanliness. Of this last circumstance, I am convinced from experience in somewhat similar instances; as I have repeatedly observed, that when I have pulled down old cottages that had clay floors, and no pantry, no pump, no outhouse for fuel, nor any vault, and have built new ones with these conveniences, which have also been white-washed both within and without; the very fame families that were before slovenly and dirty, have, upon this change of their habitations, become clean and neat in theijr persons,' in their houses, and gardens.—It was in consequence of these observations, made during my residence on my estate in Bedfordshire, that the clause for white-walhing gaols was inserted in the a8 for preserving the health of prisoners.—In addition to what has been said with regard to cleanliness, it maybe observed, that when quick lime is flaked in boiling water, and immediately used, it not only destroys vermin, but is found to be one of the flrongeH antiseptics. In confirmation of this fad, I shall take the liberty of mentioning a remarkable instance of its efficacy in this respect. Dn John Hope, the first physician to the royal infirmary at Edinburgh, informed me in one of my visits there, that two or three years before, a putrid fever had prevailed in that hospital, and that one large ward in particular was so deeply infected, as to prove fatal, for some time, to the patients that were lodged in it; but that lime-whiting the walls had eradicated the infection, after washing die ward repeatedly with vinegar had failed of this effect; and that this J'alutary practice had been continued ever £nce«

As the society’s lands are out of, condition, every matter’s expense in improving them Schools. with lime, marie See. should be fully reimbursed by the local committee, in case of his difmission or death.

The protestant gentlemen, within ten miles of a school, should be eameftly requetted to be of the local committee, and to make frequent visits to it.—The ladies within the same distance should also be desired to favour the schools with their visits; and both should make their remarks in a book kept for that purpose.

The local committee should be permitted to give stipulated premiums to die mott cleanly, orderly and diligent children, and those who make the best improvement.

This to be done with a proper degree of applause, addressing them in such a manner as may tend to excite their emulation, and this before persons whom the children mott re-ipedt; and the names of those children who obtained the premiums should be written in the visitors’ book, and sent to the committee of fifteen in Dublin.

The committee of fifteen should pay the greatest attention to the remarks of a local committee.

Some of these remarks were made in my former publication, but being more folly convinced of their importance, they are now repeated. The alterations proposed may be thought too expensive j but I am persuaded that the penurioufnefs of the society in providing diet, clothing &c. which has been long observed by those who visit the children, or fee them at church, has considerably reduced the subseripdons: and these improvements would probably recover and increase them. They would at least retrieve the credit of the society, and do honour to the protestant cause.

I cannot forbear here expressing a wish that the benefits of education were more generally extended over Ireland, than they are by theje schools. If free-schools were infti-tuted in every parish for instructing in the lower parts of learning, and the rality, children of each sex, and of all perfuafms •,it would perhaps more than any thing tend to

soften the manners of the Irish'poor, and enable their youth to relict the various temptations

• ' A X ’

to vice, to which they are inevitably exposed in their crowded huts and cabins.

The lower class of people in Ireland are by no means averse to the improvement of their children. At the cabins on the road fide I saw several schools, in which, for:the payment of js. jd. Irish per quarter, children were instrutted in reading, writing and

accounts. Some of these I examined as to their proficiency, and found them much forwarder than those of the fame age in the charter schools. They were clean and wholesome, andconfifted of the children of both protestant and catholic parents. I hope I shall not be thought, as a protestant dissenter, indifferent to the protestant cause, when I express my wish, that these distindlions were less regarded in bestowing the advantages of education }. and that the increase of protestantiftn were chiefly trailed to the diffemination of knowledge and found morals.

Remark.. Tn Scotland, almost every village has its settled school-master; die beneficial efie&s of Charter which are evident: for it is principally owing to this, that the numerous emigrants from Schools, that country, dilperfed over almost all Europe, appear with credit, and advance themselves in their several stations. * The Sunday schools lately established by the benevolence of the public, in so many parts of England, will doubtless in some degree produce similar good effects j if the benefactors abate not of their zeal and attention. But no plan that I have seen for the extended instruction of the poor seems more judiciously calculated for the purpose, than one lately instituted by the trustees of the Blue-coat Hospital, in the

• In Dr. Johnson's Sermon to the Society in Scotland for propagating chridian knowledge, published in 17869 he informs us, that “ about seven thousand poor children are indru&ed in their different schools, in reading, writing, arithmetic, the principles of the christian religion, and the ufefiil arts.’* In a fumnary me count, published in 1783 by this exemplary society are these words: " The whole annual revenue of the Society “ in Scotland does not exceed £ 2000, of which there is not above £ 1500 applicable to their great object, “ the propagation of religion in the Highlands and I (lands; yet on this small revenue they now maintain about “ one hundred and eighty schools, and educate about seven thousand young people. The sum is so dispropor-“ tioned to the object, that it would be impossible for the directors to maintain so great a number of schools,

* were they not dri&ly attentive to the ffate of the parishes, and in requiring the inhabitants, as far as they « can afford it, to contribute in part to the support of the schoolmaders, by a small quarterly fee, and “ especially by filmKhing them with a house and school-house, with fuel and a cow’s grass: this is no hardship " on them, but it is a material aid to the mailers: in a few indances, the gentlemen or noblemen in the “ neighbourhood pay a part or a half of the salary. By such frugal management the directors are enabled to « make the charities intruded to them more generally serviceable than otherwise they could have been.”

The greated part of the schools supported by the society are situated in the mod remote parts of the highlands, where the young people have no other means of indruftion; for in the low country of Scotland I had the pleasure to find parochial schools, established by law (as I have mentioned in a former publication) which afford to the poored of the people, an opportunity of giving their children a proper education.-—! mud dill add, what was highly commendable, that « the society, desirous of obtaining the fulled information with regard to

* the situation and circumstances of their schools, and the conduit of their schoolmaders in the highlands and * islands, granted a commission to Mr. Lewis Drummond, Lieutenant in the late 115th regiment of foot, in “ whom they placed a very great confidence, to visit their schools in different parts, and to make an exalt report " of all the particulars relative thereto, according to indrultions given to him for that purpose. Mr. Drummond,

in two several visitations (in 1771, 1772) each of which continued for many months, executed this trud with « such fidelity, diligence, and zeal, as judified the good opinion which the society entertained of him, and gave « them entire satisfaction. He made two didinit and complete reports of these visitations, which conveyed to " the society much intereding intelligence, concerning the (late, not only of their schools, but of religion in « general, in the highlands and ifiands of Scotland, and fuggeded to them some material alterations for the im-u provement of their plan.—

u From Mr. Drummond's reports of the date of their schools, the society have been led to adopt several m useful regulations respecting them, to which, as well as to those formerly madg, they are determined " (Iri&ly to adhere.—In order to render their schools as useful as possible, the society have lately revived an u old regulation, which requires that they shall be ambulatory, that is, that they shall remain in one place no •* longer than three years; at the end of which space, they shall be removed to such other dations in the fame u or adjacent parishes as to the society shall seem meet; provided always, that the conditions above mentioned m shall be performed by the inhabitants, who mud also be at the expence of transporting the schoolmader with his

city of Chester, where, to an ancient establishment of an hospital for poor , a charity for the education of a large number of out-scholars has been annexed, and has been productive of the happiest effects, I will therefore here transcribe the following particular account of it.

“ Of late years, the whole income of this charity has been expended in the maintenance * and education of thirty boys, whom we now call in-scholars. The annual expense of “ each in-scholar has been about £ 13, and the education of each boy for four years has coll <c £52. Such large charitable benefactions being bellowed on a few, a much larger * number of boys, equally destitute, have been suffered to grow up to men unemployed “ and uninftruCted.

“ In 1781, when the income of the hospital was augmented, it was proposed to educate “ sixty more boys, as out-scholars, to be taught reading, writing, and some arithmetic; “ but not to be clothed, maintained, or lodged in the house. This proposal was not “ accomplished till the autumn of 1783. The improvement of the sixty new scholars “ in reading, writing, and behaviour, was so remarkable, and so pleating, that, in * December 1784 a proposal was made to double the number, which was unanimously “ approved by a full and respeClable meeting of the trustees. Two mailers now teach “ one hundred and twenty out-scholars. The salary of the first mailer is £. 40, and of “ the second £25, a year. Hence the expense of each out-scholar is 10 s.

“ a year to the mailer. The annual expense of each boy in books is is. and “ in coals 4 \d.A green cap, which colls 1 s. 6d. is given to each scholar every “ year. Hence it appears that the whole annual expense of each out-scholar is 14 r. “ Consequently, more money is bellowed on one in-scholar, than would educate eighteen “ out-scholars.

" A good education is now given to thirty in-scholars, and one hundred and twenty “ out-scholars, which comprehend above one third of all the boys in Chester. The boys “ are appointed scholars about nine years old, in order to have their inltruction com-. “ pleted about the age of going apprentice. When die out-scholars are of two years t( Handing, fifteen of the bell are annually elefled in-scholars, for two years; and the “ boys not thus elected remain two years longer in the out-school.

“ It is an interesting truth, which deserves public attention, that two mailers can teach u one hundred and twenty scholars. At the examination of lall April, all the boys who “ had been two years in the school, though several did not know a letter on their admis-“ fion, could read and write very well, understood some arithmetic, and had very perfectly “ learned their catechism.”

Having in many of die schools I have visited observed, among other irregularities, the rudeness of the boys, and being persuaded that wo instruction is given them relative to a decent and becoming deportment, perhaps hints may be taken for their improvement in this respect from fbme of the rules of the excellent institution of the Quakers, at Ackworth in for the education of children of their perl'uafion, which I here copy.

-INSTRUCTIONS TO -

u That the schools, during the summer season, open at half after fix o’clock in the * morning, and in the winter at half after seven o’clock, and that they close at eight; “ that after breakfast they open at nine and close at twelve; that after dinner they open * at two and close at five. These times to be observed as near as conveniendy may be.

“ That they observe that the children come into the schools, when the bell rings, w in a quiet and becoming manner, with their faces and hands clean, hair combed, and take w their feats at the time appointed.

<c That the boys be instrufted in spelling, reading, and English grammar j that after “ dinner, the boys who attended the writing matters, shall attend the reading matters; and * the lads who attended the reading matters, shall attend the writing matters.

" In order that punishments may be inflitted with coolness and temper, and in propor-* tion to the nature of the offence, the following method is agreed upon, . That the “ treasurer and each matter keep a book, and minute down offences committed within the “ day j that once a week, or oftener, they meet together and inspect these books, and ad-* minister such punishments as may be agreed upon j using their endeavours to convince “ the children that the only purpose of correction is for their amendment, and to deter

others from the commission of the like offence.

“ That they fit down with the children and family on ift day (Sunday) evening, read-«* ing to them, or causing them to read suitable portions of the holy scriptures, and other *c religious books, the treasurer and principal matter feleCting such parts and subjects as are '* most instructive, and best adapted to their understandings.

“ That they in particular endeavour, by divine assistance, to impress upon the minds of * the children the necessity of a ftriCl adherence to truth, and abhorrence to falfehoodj as * well as a remembrance of their Creator in the days cf their youth; having the fear of the « Lord before their eyes, which will preserve under the various temptations to which they

- rious influence this doctrine has had, though so contrary to common sense and common observation. Let any one recollect the character of bricklayers, joiners, shoemakers and other mechanics, as well as of domestic fer-

« vants, and he will certainly discover, that the most honest, sober, industrious and useful both to their own « families and the public, are those who have been accustomed to attend divine service, and who were instructed, " when young, in moral principles, reading, writing, and accompts.”

I cannot better conclude this subject than in the words of my learned, much respected and honoured friend Dr. Price. “Seminaries of learning are the springs of society, which, as they flow foul or pure, diffuse through successive generations depravity and misery, or on the contrary, virtue and happiness. On the bent given to our minds as they open and expand, depends their subsequent fate; and on the general management of education depend the honour and dignity of our species.”

ENGLISH PRISONS and HOSPITALS.

THE TOWER.

Tower.

THE Tower is the only prison in England for state delinquents of rank. There has been no prisoner since Mr. Laurens went out, December 31st, 1781.

Here, in 1787, I saw a great quantity of junk or old cordage, and having again found the prisoners in the bridewells in and about London without employment, I cannot avoid repeating my former remark: “If the great quantities of old cables and ropes piled up at the Tower were delivered out to the several keepers of bridewells in and about London to be wrought for use, and prompt payment made for the work, this would prevent the excuses of keepers for not employing their prisoners.”

NEWGATE.

N£wcati. No alteration.* In three or four rooms there were near one hundred and fifty women

crowded together, mstf.y young creatures with the old and hardened, some of whom had

been confined upwards two years: on the men’s fide likewise there were many boys

of twelve or fourteen years of age; some almost naked. In the men’s infirmary, there

were only (even iron bedsteads j and at my last visit, there being twenty sick, some of them,

naked and with fores, in a miserable condition, lay on the floor with only a rug.

There were four sick in the infirmary for women, which is only fifteen feet and a half

At my last visit I went over the wards of the criminals with Mr. Curtis the new Sheriff, from whose activity and zeal I would hope something may be done for the naked objects left by the late sheriffs.—The allowance of bread should be weighed m gross, and delivered to the prisoners every day. * Unless the debtors be removed to give room for the separation of the other prisoners, and a reform be made in the prisons, an audacious spirit of profaneness and wickedness will continue to prevail in the lower class of the people in London.

• In all prisons where great numbers are served with bread, if it may not be expected that every single loaf should be weighed, yet they might be weighed by tens or twenties. To every ward here, and at both the Compters, there is an orderly prisoner called a nuardfman, who should wash, sweep and keep his ward fresh and clean, and who had for many years a double allowance of bread, till a late sheriff, Sir Robert Taylor, took it off. I wish this small encouragement to deanliness had been continued.

+ In my former work I have given an abstract of Sir Stephen Theodore JanJJen's table of convicts See. But, as in the riots in 1780, all the records of the Old Bailey were burnt, that table, as being the only remaining memorial, is now become so valuable, that I have thought proper to annex it entire at the end of the book. A careful perusal of it will, I doubt not, suggest many useful remarks; particularly, if the number of executions in former years be compared with the constantly increasing number of the present time, it may, more than any thing else, excite a conviction of the necessity of no longer delaying the erection of penitentiary houses9 in order to avoid the charges of inhumanity and impolicy, in hurrying out of the world so many young creatures, who might have been reclaimed and restored to society by a proper course of discipline.

I have also given a table of all the executions for London and Middlesex during the twelve subsequent years, and at the end of this book shall continue it to December 1788. These tables together with Janfens will give the total number of executions for forty years pall.

* One advantage that was expected from the abolition of the tap in gaols, was preventing the comrades of criminals from associating with them, which gave an opportunity of plotting further mischief, and tended to suppress impeachments, through the false hopes with which their companions encouraged them before their trials; but, by the unrestrained visits of their friends, and the permission of beer, wine &c. to be brought to them from certain public houses, this intended advantage is in a great measure frustrated.

t The prisons of late years are visited by the sheriffs, and they are much more healthy places of abode than they were formerly. The debtors, by the liberal contribution of the sheriffs and others, live in the compters better than many indufiriout tradesmen; but there is little attention to the separation of prisoners, or their morals.

WESTMINSTER PRISON.

This Prison, adjoining to the bridewell in Tothill-fields, the property of the dean and chapter, was erected in 1779 when the gate-house was taken down, and isvnow used in aid of the Savoy. It consists of four rooms, nineteen feet nine inches square, one of which is for the confinement of the refractory, in which there were two prisoners. The other three are lodging-rooms, very dirty, and the prisoners have neither bedding nor straw. Many were almost naked, and had no shoes, stockings or shirts. Several deserters had been confined from fifteen to seventeen months. Some were in heavy irons for attempting to break out. Mstny of them were sickly, and objects of compafiion. Allowance, four-pence a day each, for which they are supplied with proviGons. The stoppage of the two-pence of their pay, while they lie on the bare boards, is very severe.

Several prisoners were drinking in a room used by the turnkey for his ihop. Here is also a room for the deposit of bonnets and other articles of clothing, which may be a convenient security for the keeper’s fees; one woman, however, I turned out, who had remained four days after the expiration of her term, and had no share in the property contained in this room. In some county gaols the salaries to the gaolers are in lieu of all fees j whereby the hardship of forcing poor creatures to part with some of their scanty clothing, in order to purchase their discharge, is prevented.

The wards in general are twenty feet wide, and twelve high, and each contains about eighteen beds, which 'have no tellers. Over the doors were square apertures. The passages, which are eight feet wide, are dark. There are no citterns for water: -the vaults are often offensive. In this, and our other -hospitals, medical and chirurgical patients are together. Here -the middle floor is occupied by the women, and the lower and upper floors by the men. Would it not be better if the men were on one fide of the -house, and the women on the other ? I could wish that there were two wards appropriated to Jew patients, as -they mull almost starve, on their scanty allowance of bread and beer, with only two-pence halfpenny a day.

"Perhaps a proper attention -to them might be repaid by subscriptions from die opulent of their own profession. In a dirty room in die cellar there is a cold and a hot bath, which seem to be seldom used.—The wards were not dirty, but the house has not been white-washed for feme years; nor has it, within or without, the appearance of neat-«iefs. Patients are generously admitted without any fee or reward to nurses &c. nor is any security required for the expense of burial or removal; but for parish poor and soldiers, four-pence per day must be pud for their subsistence.—All accidents, whether recommended or not, are received at any hour of the day or night.—Here is a large chapel, in which divine service is performed twice every Sunday; and prayers are read three days in the week.

The patients’ diet I disapprove of; as, their common diet is 8 ox. of meat every day for dinner; and for supper, broth fix -days in die week. No vegetables, and only 12 oz. of bread a day.—The middle diet is 4 oz. of meat every day for dinner; and for supper, a pint of broth or panado. No vegetables, and only 8 oz. of bread. The breakfast for every day, of those patients that are on common diet, is one pint of milk pottage or water-gruel. Those on the middle diet, one pint of panado pr water-gruel.

The wards of this hospital, which are three fides of a ipacious quadrangle, are on the ground floor and three stories above.

The two foul wards for women were clean and fresh. The wards are lofty, twenty-two feet wide, and in each were about fifteen beds. The bedsteads are wood, and their tellers, though lofty, are a harbour for dull and lumber. The beds were not crowded, and the wards were quiet. The staircases are wide; the landing places Ipacious; and the windows were open.—The diet of the patients is nearly the fame as in the London hospital, except on Thursdays, when instead of 8 oz. of meat they have 4 oz. of cheese and 2 oz. of butter i and every day a pint of milk pottage, but on Thursday a pint and a half j and every day three pints of beer. The allowance of bread is too small.—Here is a large cold bath, and a room adjoining for a warm bath. To each ward there is a filler and a nurse; the former has a room adjoining, but no window into her ward. Fees are taken for the admission of patients: for clean patients 2 s. viz. 1 s. for the After, 6d. to the nurse, 6 d. to the beadle; for foul patients £ 1 :5: 8, viz. 5 s. for flannels, 18 s.8 d.for two months subsistence at 4 per day: 2 s. ward dues.—Every pa-

The mathematical, and feme other school-rooms, are lofty and good; and the dining room is large, fir which the children meet three times a day. The beds are improperly close to the wall, and have wooden tellers. The boys lie two in a bed, and the beds have clean linen once a month. The kitchen has a cupola, and is the frelhefl and bell kitchen for an hospital I have ever seen. The fiaircafes, school-rooms and dormitories should be lime-whited every year: great attention is paid to the cleanliness of the boys: they are washed morning and evening, and have clean linen twice a week.

No children are admitted under the age of seven. The girls are discharged at fourteen, and the boys at fifteen, except the mathematical boys and those intended for the university.

The boys have coats once a year: breeches twice; shoes and (lockings every quarter: caps and girdles yearly; and bands four times a year.

This hospital, built in 1755, and supported by voluntary contribution, consists of Middlesex sixteen wards, of which only four are occupied, the funds being very low. The rooms are close and dirty, except one called the founder’s. The bedsteads and wooden tellers are old: the house wants white-walhing, and the whole has an air of poverty: yet an order is hung up, that no servant shall take any fee, gratuity or reward.—In the printed laws, and orders I am sorry to find the following one. “ That all drugs, cc medicines, materials and necessaries be bought from persons, who will furnish them “ at the cheapest rate, and that the preference be given to tradesmen who are subscribers”

I made a remark on the impropriety of the blue-coat school boys in Dublin being accustomed to so much animal food, without potatoes or any kind of vegetables: I mutt make the fame here, and especially, as I am now persuaded that that school and several others copy after this excellent charity. On this subjelt many authors might be quoted; but I shall only mention Dr. Macbride, who, in his Experimental EJfays, Ihews, «that a property common to all fresh vegetables, is, that when mixed with* €t any animal substance, and placed in the proper degree of heat, they presently run into fermentation, and, in the u course of that fermentation, throw off a subtile vapour, or spirit, of surprising activity, endued with a power of “ restoring sweetness to putrid animal fluids.* * And the Doctor u lays it down as a po fit ion, not easily to be con-* troverted, that the genuine putrid scurvy has never been known to yield to any other medicines than to such as are * composed of frejk vegetables; and provided they be fresh, and of such a nature as will allow them to be takeii freely, it is almost no” matter what they are. The acid, the sweet and the bitter, all of them cure the scurvy.*— “ Sir John Pringle ascribes, and with great justice, to the frequent use of fresh vegetables and sugar, which now “ make up'so great a part of the diet of the European nations, that we at this day so seldom hear of the dreadful “ putrid diseases which formerly swept off such multitudes, every thirty or forty years, and generally went * under the name of plagues.”

Here is a clean and separate court, with wards for the sick. Only one of these was occupied, in which were five children.. I was informed that only two died last year.

The charges and orders for the several officers of this hospital are published, and given to the governors: and with pleasure I confirm the remark of my worthy friend the late Dr. Fothergill, “ that in this, which is one of “ the largett public schools for the education of children in this kingdom, and in the centre of the city of “ London, and where people of all ranks and orders are perpetually passing and repassing; such is the due r‘ subordination that is imprejfed upon them by their superiors, that one fees amongst them, while at play in u the public courts of the school, much less rudeness and disorderly conduit than might have been expelled S even from a more confined course of education.*

“ XII. That if any surgeon have any considerable or extraordinary operation to cc perform, he shall give notice of the time*of his doing the fame to the other surgeons, “ that they may be present.” But I searched in vain to find (what I have often wished were a {landing order in all hospitals) that no amputation should ever take place till after a consultation of three medical gentlemen, who shall be of unanimous opinion that it is absolutely necessary, and that there is no probability of effecting a cure without the use of the knife and saw.*

• In a county hospital, I have known one of the mofl excruciating of all chirurgical operations prevented, by the spirited exertions of the good old house apothecary: and the patient by his attention and care was cured. And even in the experience of a private country gentleman, ^among the surrounding poor, some instances have occurred, in which rest, regimen, and cooling fhyfic have /avid limbs, which gentlemen of the faculty were decidedly of opinion mull be amputated.

Guv’s Hospital in Southwark.

This hospital was founded and endowed at the foie expense of ’Thomas ,a Guy’s private citizen of London, and ereRed during his life-time. The wards in this SP1TA4‘ hospital are in general too low: the height of some is only nine feet and a half.

In several of the old wards (each containing about thirty beds) the beds and tellers are wood, and infefted with bugs. In the new wards, which were clean and fresh, * are iron bedheads and hair beds; and each patient has a box which Hides under the bedhead, and makes a feat when drawn out. The window at the upper end of each of these wards opens horn the deling to the Boor if and there are also ventilators in the cielings which communicate with the chimneys of the wards over them, and by means of the common fires draw off the foul air. The water closets in the new wards are on the heft conhruction, and not in the lead offerfive-, for by opening the door, water is turned into them. $ Here is a good contrivance for easily opening the upper falhes, which in other hospitals, being lofty and heavy, are opened with difficulty. The medicines are principally prepared under the care of an ingenious gentleman, who has been fumished with a laboratory and mills, that they may be certain of having their drugs free, from adulteration. The patients box and medicine-tray, are numbered: this prevents confusion, and consequently mifrakes which may be sometimes fatal, through the ignorance or carelessness of nurses. Here are excellent baths, in clean and neat rooms. The alterations in this hospital are to go on, and as it is situated in a very close part of the

They are so simply conttru&ed that they require little attention, and are not liable to be easily put out of repair. They are free from ill feents.

If the annual sum paid in several hospitals for the deltrucVion of bugs, were expended in airing, beating, and brulhing the beds, the end, perhaps, would be much better answered. For in the country where the air is fresh, and freely admitted into lodging-rooms, there are few or no bugs. In the hospitals in Sweden I observed a very good mode of sweetening the beds: on every fine day a certain number were brought into the open air, and beaten and brushed on a deal machine made for that purpose. I could wilh that such a practice were adopted in our hospitals, and that the rest of the bedding were more frequently washed and aired.

• A prejudice prevailing in the minds of many people against such hospiteds will, I hope, be my excuse for copying the Introduction to the AbstraQ of the Rules and Orders.

“ The disease which intitles the objects of this hospital to reEef, is in itself extremely loathsome, and direful in its effects; and the unhappy sufferers, if poverty be their companion, are doubtless involved in the moll deplorable wretchedness.

Many a worthy woman has here to lament the diabolical profligacy of an abandoned husband.—Many a poor and helpless infant to deplore its being the offspring of a distempered parent*—Many a young creature of tender years, yea, even in infancy itself, Yus to bewail the inhuman violence of a diseased, filthy, and loathsome ravisher.—Others who have been led away by the arts and wiles of seducers, by promises made only to be broken, and fair words meant only to deceive.—And lastly, many who have inadvertently fought their own ruin, have also been cured in this hospital; such, many such, but for this house, had rotted and perilhed miser-ably. Some of these, whose lives have happily been preserved, have kissed the rod of afHi&ion; by the blessing of God have turned from their iniquity, and been happily restored to their family, their country and themfel'ves,

Therefore their having brought on themselves the disease by their own fin and folly is no reason why they should be left to perish. A life loft to the public, from whatever cause, is still a loss.—If we speak of the matter in a christian view, how dare any, who profess to know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, make this an objection ? Suppose the Redeemer had urged such a pica against becoming poor for our fakes; suppose he had said of us,—*" Leave those sinners to the consequences of their fin and folly—they are miserable, guilty, loft and u undone, but it was their own fault—wlet them perish eternally—let the law take its vengeance on them—Pll * not become poor for their fakes, to save them from its curse, for they do not deserve that I ^hould,—had this been the language of our Lord, where had we now been ?—We should not now be partaking of his mercies, but feeling his righteous vengeance—not invited to an opportunity of shewing pity and compassion to others, but ourselves in torment, crying in vain for a drop of water to cool our tongues.

And though this charity gives encouragement to repentance, by giving the most profligate, one fair opportunity to reflect, and amend their lives, yet it destroys all incitement to preemption, by affording no repetition of its countenance and favour, to the hardened'and impenitent.—For it is a fixed, determinate, fundamental rule of the charity, that no person whatsoever, if once discharged, is ever to be admitted a second time.—

On the four floors there are about two hundred and seventy rooms: these were quite clean and not offensive, though the house is old and wants white-walhing. The galleries have, very properly, rooms only on one fide. The patients communicate with one another from the top to the bottom of the house, so that there is no reparation of the calm and quiet from the noisy and turbulent, except those who are chained in their cells. To each fide of the house there is only one vault: very offensive. There are no citterns at the top of the house, nor water in the upper floor.

There are fitting rooms with fire-places properly guarded with iron —a cold bath and airing grounds for each sex — no chapel — Bread allowance to patients, i a day (8 oz. at dinner, and the fame at supper). Their bread, butter, cheese and beer were very good. Two house-keepers, “ when a patient is to be admitted, enter into “ a bond of £ioo to pay for bedding andPclothes, during the patient’s continuance in the * hospital, and to take him or her away when discharged by the committee, and to pay u the charge of burial, if the patient die in the hospital.” When a patient is dismissed as incurable, his name is entered, that when there is a vacancy among the incurables (the number of whom is sixty men and fifty women) he may be admitted, paying only half a crown a week.—Vifiters are admitted by a governor’s ticket, only on Mondays and Wednesdays, between the hours of ten and twelve. Sept. 26th, 1788, Men 133. Women 139.

St. Lvke’j Hospital for Lunatics in Old-street Road.

This spadous building was first occupied on new year’s day 1786; the former in Moorfields being old and inconvenient. Here are on each of the three floors, three long galleries and wings, with opposite cells for the patients; and in the centre are apartments for officers &c. On one fide of these apartments are the men, on the other the women. In each gallery there are thirty-two cells which are arched, boarded and wain-

And all the patients, have a paper of rules and directions delivered to them at their admission, at the bottom of which Hand these words.—

N. B. u Having bun once curedor discharged for any other cause out of this hospital, you never can be admitted again”

Therefore the language of this inflitadon is, like that of our blessed Lor d — " Go andfin no more,” and like him it adds, “ left a voorfe thing happen unto thee ”

footed (ten feet four inches by eight, and thirteen feet three inches high) and each cell has a window outward, and a large aperture over the door, with inside wire lattice to the iron bars, to prevent accidents, and (very properly) no shutters. The cells were very clean and not offensive. The boxes on which the beds or straw lie are on a declivity, and have false bottoms. The cells open into galleries fifteen feet wide j and in each gallery was a vault, which was not offensive. There are many citterns on the top of the house, which are filled by four machines or forcing pumps, to supply the galleries with water. These machines cost £ 200. Here are large airing grounds for men and women: there is also a new, but very inconvenient bath.

Every patient is admitted till cured, or for one year, and must bring a security from two householders of ,£ 100, to take him out at the end of that term. If within the year he be dismissed as cured, and relapses within two months, he may be readmitted on the former petition. At the end of the year the patients who are not cured, are put on the lift of incurables. Here are forty incurables, who are called boarders, for each of whom their friends pay five fallings a week.

Here are very properly two fitting rooms in each gallery, one for the quiet, the other for the turbulent; but I could wish that the noisy and turbulent were in a separate part of the house, by day and by night. I have mentioned the propriety of hair beds for the sick, and in such houses as this they are peculiarly necessary, because water runs through them.

Several women were calm and quiet, and at needle-work with the matron. A chapel would be proper here for the advantage of recovering patients, as I have seen in such houses abroad.

Though this noble hospital was neat and clean, yet I gready prefer one at Constanti-nople, which is described in this volume, and the Dol-huis at Amsterdam, which is particularly mentioned in my former publications. Sept. 25, 1788, Men 54. Women 108.

I shall beg leave to subjoin a few general observations concerning defefls^ in the London hospitals, premising, that I fear the public attention to them is much relaxed of late years, in consequence of the newer establifhments of dispensaries, which have multiplied so as to injure the funds of the older institutions.

The securities and fees required at admission into many of the hospitals bear hard upon the poor, and absolutely exclude many of those who have the greatest occasion for charitable relief. The nurfes1 fees in particular open a door to many impositions.

The visits of Governors are too often only a matter of form, the visiter hurrying out of an offensive room, and readily acquiescing in the reports of nurses &c. Hence 1 apprehend, many instances of neglect in surgeons and their dressers, as well as other officers, go unnoticed.

I have never found any clergyman administering consolation and admonition to the sick i and prayers are usually attended by very few.

White-washing

Sect. VIII.

LONDON.

141

"White-washing the wards is seldom or never practised; and injurious prejudices against Remarsj. washing floors, and admitting fresh air, are suffered to operate.

Bathing, either hot or cold, is scarcely ever used j I suppose, because it would give trouble to the attendants.

There are no convalescent wards or fitting rooms, fb that patients are often turned out very unfit for work, or the common mode of living.

The admission of great quantities of beer for the patients from ale-houses, by alledged, or pretended orders from the faculty, is a great and growing evil. Every article of diet should be provided by the hospital, and no other, on any account, be admitted.

It is a pity that for want of attention to these circumstances, such noble institutions should be rendered of much less public utility, than was intended by their generous founders and supporters.

I gave in my Iaft Publication some hints on the Construction and Regulation of Hospitals, most of which were collected from the observations I had made abroad: I shall now take the liberty of repeating them, with a few additional observations.

The Jituation of an Infirmary or Hospital should be on elevated ground, near a stream of water, and out of a town.—The wards, if only one for each sex, to be from twenty-five to thirty feet high, arched, and without apartments over them; otherwifo, the building to consist of only two Jlories beside the cellars, and the area extended as far as necessary upon this plan, that the inconvenience of higher rooms may be avoided. The first floor raised four or five steps from the ground, and the ascent made easy to the entrance. The wards fifteen feet high to the cielings, and distinct ones for medicaL and chirurgical patients. Two doors to each ward, one of them iron latticed, or canvass. Staircase of stone, spacious, convenient and easy, as in Italy, Marseilles, Malta &c. No room to contain more than eight beds. The windows lofty and opposite, or large circular apertures (as at Leeds infirmary) opening into passages not less than fix feet wide: hafps and staples to the upper faflies to prevent their being (hut at improper times: one of the windows should open from the deling to the floor, either as folding doors, or like those at Guy’s hospital: a stone gallery for more readily opening and shutting the windows*, as in the Italian hospitals. The cielings lathed and plastered, and proper apertures in them. The fire-places in the middle of the longer fide of the wards: the beds in spacious recesses, as at Toledo and Burgos; or to each bed a with curtains as at Genoa, Savona &e. The bedsteads iron, painted, and with a screw, that the backs may be easily raised or lowered; the beds on varnished boards or laths, with hair mattresses.

In each ward a cistern, basin and towel for the patients. Vaults on the outside of the wards, and water clolets, as at Guy’s hospital: for every improvement that may render such places less offensive, should be carefully adopted in all houses containing a number of

inhabitants. Airy rooms and refe&ories for convalescent patients; one /pare and unfur-

Remarks. nished ward; each ward to be taken in succession, and called the spare ward. The kitchen, walh-house, brew-house and bake-house, out of the house: but if the kitchen be in the house, it should be lofty, as in Christ’s hospital (not under ground) and the entrance through the servants’ hall. A convenient bath, with an easy descent into it. A piazza and i'pacious walk to induce patients to take the air and exercise. The wards washed once a week—fcraped and lime-whited at least once a year. (The machines at Northwich for supplying the salt mines with fresh air, being on a Ample construftion, would be of admirable use in hospitals, especially if situated in close and confined places.) The patients washed at their admission in the cold or warm bath, and to conform strictly to the rules . of nicety and cleanliness.

It may be proper to suggest, that many of these ideas may be adopted with equal propriety in the conjlrublion and regulation of poor houses.

The debtors’ court and apartments are convenient and spacious. They have very properly a large day-room and work-room. Though- the greatest number were in the former, yet in the latter some weavers and shoe-makers were at work. The felons’ court is also spacious, and paved with flat stones; and I hope will never be spoiled with cells or any other buildings. In a narrow court on the women’s fide, there are eight new cells. The women are in the infirmary, which has never been fornished with beds &c. for the lick. The roof of this prison is now covered with copper, it having been laid too flat, which is the fault of almost all the new prisons. Allowance 1 \ lb. of 'bread, and a quart of small beer, for which the county pays the keeper 3*/. a day. Transports have the 1 s. 6 d. a week.

Acquitted prisoners are kept in irons till the judge leaves the town, unless the fees to the clerk of the crown be paid. Forty convicts here (some of whom had been under sentence of transportation three or four years) regularly receive the king’s allowance of a week. In many other gaols

the convicts have only the county allowance j -and several gaolers have observed, that when released after long confinement, they seldom live ,above a year or two. Here is a better contrivance for the execution of criminals than that at Newgate. The hooks and eyes being fixed in the wall, die scaffolding is easily placed; and, by a simple contrivance, the platform falls back, and the criminals are left hanging. I have now no complaint of the neglect of the chaplain’s duty; but I could wish that here, and in all county gaols, those. gentlemen would note down every time of their attendance in a book kept for the purpose, for the inspection of the magistrates j as is done in some hospitals.—Gaoler’s salary £ 280 in lieu of the tap.

Here are many good alterations. The "Debtors' is new and separate} and the

gaoler’s house is now between that and the felons’ prison. The rooms that were lately the debtors’ on the first floor, and also their court, are now occupied by the felons; yet they are still crowded and have too litde air. The infirmary, which consists of two close rooms, is in one of the courts. No bath. Two years ago, about twenty died of the gaol-fever. The thick wooden bars in the windows - of the wards greatly obstruct the air and light. Divine service is still performed on the staircase. Several windows both of the debtors and felons are towards the street, which occasion many inconveniences to the neighbourhood. Here are no rules respecting the quantity of liquors which may be admitted for the debtors: indeed rules would be almost useless where the windows are so fituatei. Debtors and felons have the county allowance of bread and beer, and the assize convicts have also the half crown a week. Some of the prisoners expressed their desire of having their bread allowance increased, though they were to have less beer.

The Gaol was clean. I observed that the irons on the felons were very light, which induces them to use exercise; and I am persuaded that a good gaoler can more easily manage his prisoners by humane attention than by severity and heavy irons. Gaoler’s salary £ joo in lieu of the tap.

Here was a prisoner under sentence of death in one of the dungeons. The gaoler agreed with me in opinion, that execution should not be deferred longer than ten days after the sentence.

No alteration in this prison. The men and women felons associate togetjier; their night-rooms are two dungeons. Only one court for debtors and felons; and no apartment for the gaoler. Convicts have not the is. 6d.a week. A table of fees, and the act for preserving the health of prisoners are hung up; but rules and orders, and the daufes against spirituous liquors are not hung up: no infirmary: no bath: prison not kept so clean as in the former keeper’s time. Coals allowed both to debtors and felons. Chaplain to the gaol and bridewelltthe Rev. Mr. Crowe; his salary 40. Gaoler’s salary £ 60 in lieu of the tap.

• I shall here beg leave to make a lhort digression, in order to recommend to notice and imitation a irk-beufc situated in the adjacent parish of Cardington. This is a neat building, with rooms ventilated by

windows, having detached, an infirmary, and various offices, as wash-honfe, bake-house, cow-house See. together with a good garden and drying ground. The poor in it are neatly clad 1 and their diet, employment, and treatment in sickness and health, are all regulated with drift order and humane attention. The children are kept clean, apd made cheerful and happy, in cenjiant employment, yet not to the neglect of their inftrnOiem in what regards their best interestt. It is to the nnabating zeal and assiduity of a young lady, that tbit parish is indebted for the txvoplary management of its poor.

COUNTY GAOL, CAMBRIDGE CASTLE.

A good lized court for debtors is made out of the castle yard; and a small court for felons: this. I am persuaded is little used; for at my visits I found them locked up, as is generally the case where the keeper lives at a distance. The felons have no fire-place; their rooms are close and offensive, especially the inner room for women. Transports have not the two shillings and sixpence a week. Acquitted prisoners are confined till the judge leaves the town. Chaplain, the Rev. Mr. , his salary £ 45; twenty pound

There is also a mill for beating hemp and cutting logwood.—Here is an infirmary; and a chapel in which the Rev. Mr. Beevor kindly officiates every other Sunday. The prisoners have no use of the large court, but for walhing themselves at the pump in the morning. The rooms Were dean, and none of the prisoners in irons. Keeper’s salary £ 62 and one fourth of the prisoners’ earnings.

A lift of the prisoners is made out for the inspection of the magistrates at every quarter sessions, containing—their names—crimes or offences—time when committed—-by whom committed—for what time committed, and punishments to be inflifted— ages—distinftion. of fexes—trade or occupation—employment—behaviour—total earnings—and expense of maintenance.

I have been the more particular in my account of this prison, as it affords one of the best examples of the proper management of a house of correction, lo as to render it a place of rformation for the idle and dissolute. It is to the unremitted attendon of a

neighbouring magistrate. Sir Thomas Beevor, that the public is indebted for the improve-' ments in this house, and the strict execution of its salutary regulations. The other bridewells in this county, I understand, are on the fame plan.

NORWICH CITY and COUNTY GAOL.

The gaoler’s salary is £6§ ;and now no illegal fee or gratuity is paid to the sheriffs. Norwich No free ward for poor debtors. The chamber rent is high: the price fixed over the door Gaou

of each room as in the castle. The gaol very dirty: the rules not enforced. No proper separation of the sexes: this and several other defects I intimated to the magistrates who met me here in 1787, but there has been no alteration since, except in the infirmary.

The gaol-delivery for this populous city being only once a year, prisoners are often confined before their trials ten or eleven months. The Mayor, Sheriffs and Citizens have lately petitioned his Majesty, that the assizes may be at Norwich, twice a year.

Surely there will be no denial to the justice and humanity of this petition. A county meeting-was also held on July 19th, 1788, for obtaining the removal of the Lent assize from Thetford to Norwich.

The rules, and orders, which were hung up, are to be observed, and enforced at the Houses of CorriBion, in the County of Norfolk. These rules are in fourteen sections, but the first thirteen, being similar to those at Bury, and the fourteenth as the £xteenth order in that paper, I here omit them; as I shall give them under the article of Bury St. Edmund*s.

The Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.

This lpacious infirmary was perfectly neat and clean: the beds not crowded: the wards quiet and fresh j and the dietary hung up. A notable matron. There are about ninety beds: at my last vilit fifty-two were occupied. If I might hint at a defeat in an hospital which does honour to the governors, I would mention the impropriety of the walh-house being within the house, and the preservation of the urine as a perquisite of the nurses.

In this city there are two large paor-houjcs; and a new and good inditudon of lpinning schools for children of both sexes, where they (pin in the Scotch way.

I visited also the hospital for aged persons, which was formerly a monastery, and given to the city by king Henry the Eighth. The houfo and lands are appropriated for an asylum to the aged of both sexes. Here were eighty-six persons who lodge in enclofod beds in halls, where I found all the windows Ihut. Some of them said they differed this inconvenience from the obstinacy of one or two who lay in the fame hall. It would be much better if each person had a room with a window, as at the hospital for old people at Edinburgh, page 77.

This prison as usual, was very clean. The house is much quieter since the late Att; the felons having only small beer: and the magistrates have properly ordered, that no debtor shall have more than one quart of beer in a day} to which order the gaoler and turnkey ftrUlly adhere. In consequence of the Act, and similar regulations, I have found in several prisons, fewer debtors. Here the number of insolvent debtors, on an average, was formerly fifteen; of late, not more than nine; and now it is reduced to seven. The gaoler’s salary is now £ 200. The Rev. Mr. Bronte is still afiiduous in his attention to the prisoners; frequently weighing the bread, and making his reports to the magistrates: and he fees that a proper distribution is made of Mr. s charity. I was pleased

with his observation, that he could not attribute the health and regularity of the prisoners in general, and their constant attendance at the chapel with great decency and devotion, to any other cause than to the total abolition of the tap.

• At several of my former visits to this town, I looked in at the poor-house', bat generally finding it in a dirty and sickly condition, and affording no subject for imitation, in conformity to my usual custom, I passed it over in lilence. I had now, however, the pleasure of finding this large house, containing throe hundred and two persons, quite dean; the poor taking their meals in a clean and spacious hall, formerly a crowded bed-room; the old wooden tellers removed; and the bed-rooms kept fresh and clean by washing twice a week. In such houses much depends on a neat and notable matron, who has humanity joined with firmness, and good sense enough to be directed by those who have more knowledge than herself. Such a woman is a in an hospital or

parish work-house.

I also viiited a eharity-school here, where I law thirty fine healthy boys and twenty girls. I was pleased with a practice I observed of taking the boys to bathe in the sea, under the inspection of their mailer. This is done in.a very orderly manner, three times a week, during the summer. Cold bathing, especially in salt-wateri prevents many cutaneous and other diseases, promotes perspiration, and strengthens and invigorates the whole habit. IlSvould also be useful to encourage the children in learning to swim on these occasions.

Gaoler’s salary is £ 140 in lieu of the tap. The prisoners are healthy, and the debtors are fewer since the sale of liquors has been abolished. * Here are three new cells (seven feet two inches by fix feet nine). Escapes by ladders on the outfxde are now prevented, by a few courses of loose bricks laid on the stone coping. The convicts in several gaols, not being removed for a long time after their sentence, become desperate, and often break out, as they did lately at this prison. There were two women in the bridewell

• Mr. Simffon, and some of the most reputable gaoler* have said, “ it is a great happiness to this country that the taps are taken from the gaols," and they are pleased with the alteration; but especially their wives, as the prisoners are more quiet and orderly. Other keepers have said, “ if my prisoners were to have no other drink but milk and water, they would enjoy better health.”—I add, now, persons of reputation will more readily accept the important trull.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL.

READING. A new prison, containing fix close (called refractory) cells, nine feet and a half by seven and a half* eight solitary cells, ten feet by seven feet nine inches, with' courts about the fame fizej and fix wards for prisoners, who are permitted to be together. The rooms are furnished with bedsteads and straw mattresses, but no coverlets. The sewers make most of the rooms and courts offensive. Here is a chapel, where the worthy chaplain officiates twice a week. Allowance, a threepenny loaf daily (weight 2 lb. 3 oz.) and meat on Sundays. No employment. Keeper’s salary 50. No fees. The names of die prisoners, and terms of confinement, are written on the doors of their cells. I observed feme were for one year: a severe confinement, to be so long in solitude, unemployed, in nauseous cells, and without fire in winter.

1788, July 12, Prisoners 17.

* I wish all prisoners to have separate rooms; for hours of thoughtfulness and reflection are necessary. The gen* tleraen of this county, by their building this house of correction, and in various other instances, have shewn themfel vet so attentive, and zealous in whatever may contribute to the real interests of their fellow creatures, that I am glad to take this occasion of making some remarks on solitary confinement. The intention of this, I mean by day as well as by night, is either to reclaim the most atrocious and daring criminals; to punish the refradory for crimes committed in prison; or to make a strong imprettlon, in a short time, upon thoughtless and irregular young persons, as faulty apprentices, and the like. It should therefore be considered by those who are ready-to commit, for a long term, petty offenders to absolute solitude, that such a date is more than human nature can btar, without the hazard of dittradion or despair; that it is repugnant to the Act which orders all persons in houses of correction to <work; and that for want of some employment in the day (as in several houses of correction) jiealth is injured, and a habit of idleness or inability to labour in future, is in danger of being acquired. The beneficial effects on the mind, of such a punishraent, are speedy, proceeding from the horror of a vicious pejfon left entirely to his own reflections. This may wear off by long continuance, and a sullen insensibility may succeed. 2 READING

chapel over it, will be built entirely by the convi£ts. These were at work, and guarded only by one man, though several of them, for their good , had their irons taken

off. This proves, that among such delinquents many are reglaimable, and not so entirely abandoned as some are apt to suppose. (They were going to wprk on the navigation). The encouragements here given with respect to their diet, clothes, and term of confinement, have been the means of recovering many from their bad habits, and of rendering them ufefyl member? of society. Here the convicts are not defrauded of the king’s allowance of 2 /. 6 d. a week.

In my former edition of The State of the Prisons, his Majesty’s kind donation of £ £oo for the discharge of insolvent debtors at Salisbury was inserted. His gracious My'efty lately left £ 300 at Oxford for the fame humane purpose; by which bounty twenty-six debtors out of twenty-seven were released: all their creditors, one only excepted, readily coming into the composition, and the twenty-seventh received £ 25, to recover a dent for the benefit of himself and hi? creditors. With pleasure I mention this proper and faithful application of the money, well knowing that part of the donation at Salisbury was spent for the benefit of the gaoler’s tap.

The felons lodge in the old castle. Here all the rooms were much cleaner and fresher than I had seen them at my former visits. One of the regulations is, that 00 viikers shall be admitted on Sundays; which would be very proper in all gaols, as that is, coo generally, a day of confusion and intoxication. This is remarkably the case in the prisons *t London. The new gaoler’? folary is £ 105. 17 87, Nov. aft, Debtors 12.

I am sorry that I mull repeat my remarks on the closeness and offenfivenefs of four out of the five large wards of this county hospital, viz. three of the men’s and the lower one of the women’s. None of the windows of the staircases were open; the upper sashes are fixed; as is one part of the falhes in several of the wards. The dryt. jubbing of the floor?, which is too generally practised in hospitals, is almost as bad as hiding the dirt with sand. Here is a convenient and good bath; and, very properly, the wash-houfo and brew-house are detached buildings.

Won* Here are eighteen new cells and a day-room for men, and two cells and a day-room Cas*tlb. for women felons, and over these, two rooms, with JmaU windows for women-debtors.

The workmen were repairing the dunge<my in the court. In each of the cells, felons (very improperly) lie together on the floors. These cells were dirty; and the apertures for air were all stopt, through the inattention of the gaoler. Debtors and felons are in one court: this should be divided: and there is only one day-room for felons and convicts: these should have separate day-rooms and courts. Convidts have not the half crown a week.

The two sick-rooms are badly contrived; one of which has no window. The late keeper and his wife who succeeded him, both jiied of the gaol-fever. * Acquitted prisoners are kept in irons till the judge leaves the city, when the gaoler pays 2 for each, and 12 s. 6 d. for the calendar.—The gaoler is a butcher, and lives some miles distant; and his son, a young man, has the care of this large prison.

• In the course of my pursuits, I have known also several amiable young gentlemen, who, in their zeal to do good, have been carried off by that dreadful disorder, the gaol-fever; and this has been one incentive to my endeavours for its extirpation out of our prisons. I shall mention one affecting instance which happened here, of a young physician falling a sacrifice to this distemper through a benevolent attention to some prisoners afHi&ed with it, as the circumstance is related by Dr. Barnes in the Manchester Memoirs, vol. II. /. 85. w Dr. Johnstone 44 junior, of Worcester, has lately fallen a much lamented martyr to a noble discharge of duty, in attending 44 the prisoners ill of a fever in Worcester jail (1783). He attained, at an early period, to great and deserved 44 eminence in his profession: and will be ever regretted as a physician of great ability and genius, and as one of the most pleasing and benevolent of men; prematurely snatched from his friends and country, when become highly 44 agreeable and useful to them.”—And yet, alas ! the dreadful dungeon here, the planks of which were periihed by damp and the breath of prisoners, was at my last visit preparing again for the reception of others.

f His Majesty, in his late visit to this city, very humanely left £ 300 to be applied to the releasing of debtors from confinement. I could have wished he had made such a kind visit,to this castle as he did at Oxford*

COUNTY GAOL at STAFFORD.

No alteration in this crowded prison. Only one small day-room for men and women. Stafford In the dungeon for male felons, I saw fifty-two chained down, hardly fourteen inches C<3aol7 being allowed to each. The moisture from their breath ran down the walls. I need not intimate the heat and offenfivenefs of this dungeon, and the paleness of the prisoners.

The women were in irons, and lay in another dungeon. Last year, seven of the felons died in their dungeon of the gaol-fever: and the free-ward, or county chamber, being directly over it, nine out of thirteen of the poor debtors died. No infirmary: no bath.

Act for preferring the health of prisoners not hung up. Though this prison is bad and crowded, many things might be done by an attentive and humane gaoler for the convenience and health of his prisoners, consistently with his own security. One debtor’s attempting to escape was not a sufficient reason why a window should be bricked up in the county chamber, which before was too dark and close. A lofty and good room with a fire-place, over the women’s dungeon, was kept during the sickness, and is still retained, for the gaoler’s lumber. I am sorry that when this circumstance was publicly mentioned, some gentlemen should so readily acquiesce in the gaoler’s that the room was

not secure. It is a strong room: but even admitting it not so strong as the dungeon, it is sufficiently secure for some who are not the nribft atrocious criminals, and especially such.as are lick, or in dying circumstances. Allowance, two shillings, in fifteen penny loaves and a Ik.of cheese a week. The bread was good and of proper weight. Convicts have the two shillings and sixpence a week.

This county obtained an act 26 Geo. III. I

I cannot but lament; as it is one gnat and obvious reason why our prisons are so crowded both with debtors And felons. Many magistrates are sensible of this evil, yet so dreadfully supine and timid, as to grant frelb licences (often at the intercession of their interested clerks) m which their conduct is highly culpable. It should be remembered, that it is the /pint of our laws, and therefore the duty of magifbates, by every means to vent, if possible, the commission of crimes.

* Such a quantity of cheese is improper in prisons. For the gd. a week here in milk, oatmeal, potatoes Or other vegetables, they might have a hot mess almost every day.

f I have often wished that gentlemen would make Rules for the c<mdu3 of gaolers, as well as for prisoners, end many gaolers have wiftied for such rules. New keepers would then be informed that Jleady discipline, and Jlritt regularity will do more to keep prisoners in health, and prevent -the commission of crimes in gaols, than fe verity and opprejjton. I have often thodght that a sober, humane, half-pay cjjicer would make one of the best gaolers.

X The late gaoler’s charge to the county for the lick, for four years, in wine &c. was^ 3^6: 15: of,cx* elusive of the surgeon’s and apothecary’s bills. Probably, if a tenth part of it had been allowed for clothes, linen, soap, and other nccelkiries for cieanliness, with proper bedding and nourishment, it would have saved the lives of many of our fellow creatures.

All the nurses here, and in the hospital at Plymouth, are women, which is very proper, as they are more cleanly and tender j and they more eaflly pacify the patients, who are seafaring men. Vifiters are admitted, very properly, only on two days in a week. The staircases are spacious, but they are of wood: the rises are too high; and there is no hand-rail on the wall. The inftde sewers are offensive: there are no cisterns in the wards: the pipes by which they are

supplied with water, both for drink and walking, adjoin (indelicately) to the sewers. The two cells for lunatic patients are too close and badly situated. The cieling of tire attic floor is too low (seven feet); when the hospital is new lbofed, it may be raised with little additional expense. To each wing diere should be a sea-bath; and a circulation of air is as absolutely necessary through the centre of the front as in the wings. If there were apertures into the passages, near the cieling, they would keep the wards fresh at night. Under several of the wards there are cellars for wood, lumber &c. which are dangerous in case of fire. For security against fire and infectious disorders I prefer the hospital at Plymouth, a plan of which is in my former work.

Some of the principal offices, such as the dispensary, water-works, wash-house, bed-house and fumigating-cells, being very properly detached buildings, are not in the plan which I give of this hospital at Haflar. See plate xix.

* A prisoner, Thomas Plat, lately died in one of the foKtary cells, and the verdict of the coroner’s jury was, died by hunger mid cold. Since this, the allowance was augmented as above.

f The work-house for St. Peter's parish in Marlborough, adjoining to the bridewell, is quite out of repair, and the clay floors in holes. The rooms and inhabitants were very dirty, and had no linen or means of deanliness. They had little or no bedding: some lay on straw on the floors, and others had a few rags to cover them on old bedsteads. It is no wonder that a putrid fever lately ran through this house. The other poor-house, in St. Mar/s parish, is equally neglected: three or four lay in a bed with only rags and straw, and some of the children were almost naked.—Parish officers so inattentive to what humanity and decency require, expose the inhabitants of whole towns to the danger of contagious disorders, by such objetts wandering about the streets. I have in a former publication, mentioned an instance of a foreign gaoler being made an example of (being hanged) for starving his prisoners.

A new gaol, on a bad plan, and slightly built. A much better plan was proposed

Allowance to both debtors and felons i lib.of bread a day. It was weight; but of bad quality, and not well baked, though the county pays for the belt. The convicts have not the is. 6d. a week, though I suspect it is charged in the bill of cravings: here

and in several other counties, this article in the under-sheriffs bills should be examined.

Acquitted prisoners are kept in gaol in irons till the judge leaves the town, unless certain fees be paid to the clerk of the crown, cryer &c. but if the fees be paid, they are immediately discharged; for such as have money have no fear of detention for other indictments.

I had the pleasure to find that the proprietor, John Denny Roll Esq. has given £ 1000 Ex iter towards a new gaol, which will be now under the direction of the county magistrates by an High Gaol Act of Parliament. Neither the late gaoler, Waber, who died of the gaol-fever, nor his widow who kept the gaol one year after him, nor the present gaoler have received any money from the county for the fees of acquitted prisoners; according to the act, though they have paid Mr. Follet, the clerk of the crown, his demand for the Judges’ Calendars.

There were three women in their sick room, and I was surprised at finding with them a shoe-maker at work at his trade. On inquiring into the cause, I was informed that he was the husband of one of the women who was committed Sept, ift 1785, and on the 20th of March 1786 was sentenced to be transported for seven years, for dealing a

calfs skin. In Nov. 1786 she was ordered to the hulk at Plymouth, but on account of lameness contracted by a fever in the gaol, Ihe could not be removed: a fine child, which is her fifteenth, was born in the prison. Her husband persisted in declaring he would never leave her, but would go abroad with her. Such conltancy of affection in prisons is very uncommon in men, though I have frequently found it in the other sex. — But by the kindness of Lord Sydney, the woman received a free pardon Dec. 27th, 1787: and I since leam that this couple are useful and worthy members of the community.

Here the assize convicts have the is. 6d. a week j but those convicted at the sessions only the county allowance of 11 ox. of bread, which was good, ahd full weight. The under-sheriff in his late bill of cravings charged the fame for both; but the latter was not allowed. However the county indemnified the gaoler, who had paid the is. 6d. a week to the fession conviCts. Prisoners indicted for felony and acquitted at the assize, are not immediately discharged, as ordered by the late Act, but are kept in prison several days, till the judge leaves the town; unless the clerk of the crown hand over a paper to the gaoler as an intimation that his fees are paid: then there is no pretext of detention made, for fear of other indictments being brought against them.

I found at my last visit that the gaoler’s salary is now £ 100, ahd that the county pro- ' poses to build a new gaol, for which a situation is chosen, much better than that of the present gaol.* 1787, Nov. 13, Felons 22. 1788, June 29, Felons 23. Deserters 2.

SHERIFF’S WARD, EXETER.

The frequent broils between the keeper and his prisoners for two or three years past shew the necessity of rules and orders for prisoners and keepers being fixed by parliament I put the fame question here, that I had proposed at York, Durham, Newcastle, Nottingham, Leicester, Norwich &c. namely, what was the number of debtors who had flung themselves into prison, through the hope of an insolvent act during this year (1787) and who had fetded with their creditors, and gone out, on finding that the bill did not pass ? The number was twenty, and their names were given me; but he said, that the number was greater in 1786, when an insolvent bill was thrown out.

I am sensible however that there are real objects of compassion in many of our prisons, fwho are even in want of the necessaries of life, having no allowance; no friends. Such is William Luckis, who has been here confined since April 1786 under a heavy treble penalty, on a conviction for smuggling: he was only a hired servant to a farmer, and when he came in was a hale young fellow, but is now much thinner through want; yet, such unfortunate persons, being king s fines,insolvent bills exclude.

after this, being fumished with the hospital-dresses, they should be examined and sent to their proper wards, from a door to be broken through the wall of the hospital: with such precautions, it is obvious that the-hazard of spreading contagion mull be much lessened.

A window should be made near the door of each ward, and opposite the window in the lobby, for the better ventilation of the wards.

Two pavilions at the entrance of the hospital, contiguous to the steward’s and agent’s offices, are wanted—for a council-room, and for the purpose of surveying invalids; the present one being inconvenient, and subjectijd to noxious smells on account of its situation in a narrow passage up one pair of flairs—likewife, for apartments for assistant-surgeons and assistant-dispensers in time of war, who, for reasons too obvious to mention, ought to sleep within the hospital.

The chapel should be on the ground floor; it is now up flairs, and the deling is too low. It might be converted into a dispensary, much more convenient than that used at present, which is too dark, and not sufficiently large for the purpose.

A nurse’s room or cabin injures several of the wards: the others are more free and open.

• I hope I shall be excused in repeating what I have had occasion to mention with respect to many prisons, that there is no bath, though baths are ordered in all gaols by the Act for preferring the health of prisoners. I would here also remind gentlemen, that when baths are provided in compliance with the act, if they be not made conrc-' went, so that felons in their irons may eommodiously use them; and if there be no allowance for soap and towels; these prisoners will receive very little if any benefit from them, and will never bathe but when actually compelled.

t In most of the county gaols I have, in my late tours, inquired of the gaolers, how many debtors they candidly thought had Hung themselves into their gaols, on what are called friendly actions, and who on the insolvent bill not passing have gone out ? After some deliberation, they have told me the number; and (bme have added, “ Few people know how much this country is obliged to the Chancellor for his opposing the insolvent bUls.*

t I am generally most attentive to the dungeons and rooms of the felons: for, though the debtor apartments are often equally dirty, yet, besides having other privileges, their rooms are opened sooner, and (hut much later: it is seldom that any contagious disorder begins with them,

Here, the gaoler said he had sometimes thirty prisoners, who were almost stifled. Only one window; another that was opposite being flopped up. The gaoler pays the hard tax on windows, £3: 15: 6. Salary none: has license for beer. 1788, June 30, Debtors 3.

• The Bristol Infirmary now building in the close and confined situation of the old one, will be a monument of the unlkilfulnefs of the fub/cribers, or of their inattention to what constitutes a healthy hospital, when a fine situation was proposed, at no great diitance, and was strongly recommended by the gentlemen of the faculty.

Colfion's hospital for one hundred boys. Their uniform is blue with an orange-coloured lining. The school and bed rooms were clean: the boys looked healthy: every thing regular and in order. The daily allowance of bread (which weighed only 1202.) is too scanty. They have 6 oz. at dinner, three for breakfast, and three for supper. (The bread allowance was lately increased to the boys at Christ Church Hospital London.)

f I am generally attentive to the staircases and passage windows in hospitals, that the wards, by apertures, (as at Leeds) may be freshened from them. I have often mentioned the upper sashes being fixed; for if lofty and moveable, the smallest opening produces a circulation of the stagnant air, and that so imperceptibly to the patients, that there is little danger of either the nurses, or them shutting the windows.

This is one of the befi bojpitals in the kingdom. In the wards, which are fifteen feet eight. inches high, there is great attention to cleanliness j and fix circular apertures or ventilators open into a passage five feet and a half wide. There are no fixed tellers: no bugs in the beds. Many are here cured of compound fractures, who would lose their limbs in the unventilated and offensive wards of feme other hospitals.

• In myvarious tours, I have often heard of the death of one or more prisoners by intoxication and quarrels in frifons. Here one had lately been unhappily killed.

f In all manufacturing towns it would be proper to have solitary cells for the confinement of faulty apprentices and fenrants for a fnn days, where they should be con drained to work, End have no vifiters unless clergymen: for a short term would probably do more to effect a reformation, than three or four months confinement; as it is generally found that in the first two or three days prisoners seem to have their minds most affected and penitent.

A county magistrate said, “ we have thought it necessary to refrain from commitment in many cases where that mode of proceeding would otherwise have been salutary, from a full persuasion of the total unfitness of the places of confinement or of correction, to answer those reformatory purposes for which a well-regulated restraint is peculiarly calculated.”

% Here is a well-regulated 'wori-bcufe, which I found at this, and at my former visits, clean and quiet. There were 49 men, 65 women, 38 boys and girls. The provisions were good of the fort, and the dietary may be acceptable to some of my readers.

At this, and several other work-houses, I collected the rules and orders for the better government of the poor; on which, not being die main object in view, I make no observations.

• In the foor-bou/e there were fifty-four men, one hundred and three women, sixty-fbur boys, and fifty-four girls. The house and the numerous inhabitants were, as at my former visits, clean and neat. The placidnefs of their countenances bespoke the attention of the notable matron Mary Ecken, who has been there thirty-one years.

I would lay great stress on the regular catechising of children in all work-houses twice a week. This exercise might be highly beneficial also to many older persons there, who are very ignorant, and I am fully persuaded can receive but little advantage from attending upon public worship and hearing sermons there, without some more easy and familiar instruction, to inform their minds, and enlarge their comprehension.— On catechising likewise, and plain* serious, familiar discourse on the great practical principles and duties of religion, the beneficial effects of Sunday fihools will in a great degree depend.—Pilfering and dealing are frequently owing at first to the want of proper instruction in early life; and these naturally lead to the commission of more enormous offences; for, corrupt as our nature is, robbery and murder are seldom, if ever, the first crimes of the unhappy wretches who commit them; but when once persons have entered upon evil courses, they commonly advance by hasty steps, till they become totally depraved and abandoned to all kinds of wickedness.

• In looking into the Cloth-hall in this town I was (truck with the elegant neatness and plainness of the building, as affording many good hints for a penitentiary house: I therefore determined to give the elevation of part of this building in my plan. (See plate xx.). The area is 110 yards by 90: the building is quadrangular, containing 315 rooms; their size twelve feet and a half, by eight: the windows 3 feet wide: the staircases and passages are of done; the latter 6 feet wide to the iron balustrade, and also, •very properly, 3 feet 5 inches high*. The rules and orders are hung up on the staircases.

f At Ackivorth, near Pontefract, there is a school belonging to the people called Quakers || in a healthy and fine situation. The house was built as an appendage to the foundling hospital, but was purchased (for about £ 7000) at the desire of that excellent man Dr. Fothergill, and intended for the education, maintenance and clothing of children of both sexes whose parents are not in affluence. They are instructed in reading, writing and accompts, and the girls in knitting, (pinning, plain needle-work and domestic occupations. A fraall part of every day is devoted to silent and serious thoughtfulness, which does not seem tedious or irksome to the children, for they are habituated from their early infancy, at dated times, to silence and attention.

The house is a good and spacious building, and well adapted for the proper separation of the boys and girls. No children are admitted younger than nine years of age, except orphans, and but few remain in the house after they are fourteen. As the school is partly supported by donations and legacies, the expense to the parents is easy (about eight guineas a year for each child). The general average number of children is three hundred and ten. From the 18th of October 1779, to the end of 1787, nine hundred and ninety-two children have been admitted. Of these only twelve have died; three of them by the small-pox in 1782, in the natural way. Of thirty-two who were inoculated, none died.

At my visit, Jan. 10th, 1788, there were one hundred and sixty-two boys, and one hundred and eight girls, neat and clean, at their several employments, and the school-rooms were in great order. The children were calm and quiet, and their countenances indicated that this did not proceed from fear of the severity of their masters or mistresses. (I well remember an epression of the doctor’s to me with reference to this school, “ we have got a person at the head of it, who is made for the purpose.”) Their bed-rooms were clean and in order s the children (properly) lie on hair mattresses, and in each room is an uftier or mistress. — I omit the diet table* because I do not approve of beer for children, nor of meat oftener than once or twice in a week.

U This] much respected people, with whom I have passed many agreeable hours of my life, I trust will believe me when I say I cordially join in opinion with Dr. Perch/*/, who in his Dissertations fays, “ The people improperly, because opprobriously, called Shaken, 4t certainly meric a very high degree of esteem from their fellow citizens, on account of their industry, temperance, peaceableneft, << and catholic spirit of charity.” To which I will add, as an amiable property, their uncommon ncatnefi in their person* and housej.

• " One circumstance peculiarly worthy of notice, is the perfect and uninterrupted health of the inhabitants of “ New Zealand. In all the vilits made to their towns, where old and young, men and women, crouded about our voyagers, they never observed a single person who appeared to have any bodily complaint; nor among u the numbers that were seen naked, was once perceived the (lighted eruption upon the (kin, or the leaf! mark u which indicated that such an eruption had formerly existed. Another proof of the health of these people is the u facility with which the wounds they at any time receive are healed. In the man who had been (hot with “ a musquet-ball through the flelhy part of his arm, the wound seemed to be so well digested, and in so fair u a way of being perfectly healed, that if Mr. Cook had not known that no application had been made to it, he u declared that he should certainly have enquired, with a very interested curiosity, after the vulnerary herbs u and surgical art of the country. An additional evidence of human nature’s being untainted with disease in u New Zealand, is the great number of old men with whom it abounds. Many of them, by the loss of their M hair and teeth, appeared to be very ancient, and yet none of them were decrepid. Although they were “ not equal to the young' in muscular strength, they did not come in the lead behind them with regard to chear-u fulness and vivacity. Water, as far as our navigators could discover, is the universal and only liquor of the “ New Zealanders. It is greatly to be wilhed, that their happiness in this respe& may never be destroyed by u such a connexion with the European nations, as shall introduce that fondness for spirituous liquors which hath “ been so fatal to the Indians of North America.”

See the Life of Captain Cook; by Dr. Kippis, Chap. II. p. loo. 1788.

f Here was a prisoner, lately the widow of an old gentleman, who left her an estate of £ 300 per annum and about £ 7000 in mortgages. She was afterwards married in Scotland to a Mr. Milbourne of this city, who soon spent £ 4000, but upon some disagreement (he refused to give up the mortgages of the other £ 3000. By an attachment from the court of chancery, her husband sent her to the common gaol, which confinement prevented her compliance with an order for appearance at that court in fifteen days of St. Hilary's term next ensuing. At first (he was on the mailer’s fide; but the late gaoler, after cruelly seizing her clothes &c. for chamber-rent, turned her to the common fide. Her room (nine feet and a half by eight and a half) has no fire-place. She* not having the county allowance, supports herself by spinning and knitting, and the occasional kindness of her late husband’s relations, while her present husband is living and rioting on her ellate.

By a letter dated the 14th of October 1788, from a respectable gentleman at Carlisle, I am informed that Mrs. Milbourne is Hill in the gaol, and that for above two years, Mr. Milbourne did not give her one farthing, her fubfillence being wholly on occasional charities, and the final! earnings of spinning, at which employment (he could not get more than 4 d. but now by practice and extremely close application (when health permits) can earn 10^. a week. In March lad her husband sent her twenty shillings, and in October 1788 (twenty-seven weeks after) the fame sum. The justices lait quarter sessions commiserating her hardships, have allowed her the county bounty; the first shilling of which, this modest poor woman received, the 1 ith of Odt. 1788.

COUNTY GAOL, LANCASTER CASTLE.

This prison was clean and quiet. Many of the convicts had only a Angle ring; and from a view of the prisoners in their rooms, and at chapel, I am persuaded the gaoler,. Mr. Higgins, is humane and attentive. J Allowance to the debtors who are poor, two sixpenny loaves a week; to felons 11 lb. of household bread a day, and a pennyworth of potatoes, butter, or cheese; and on Sunday, half a pound of good beef without bone, and a quart of broth, toals both to debtors and felons. The assize convicts have not the half crown a week. The good old surgeon, Mr. Wright, constandy refuses the debtors’ application for spirituous liquors, as he well knows the quarrels, riot and confusion, such admission has frequently caused

* The late gaoler killed himself by drinking; and I find, in my visits, that many others have died by this vice; the taps in the gaols having been a very strong temptation to them.

t I found the avork-house clean and quiet, as at my former visits. The cielings of all the rooms are too low, only seven feet high; the kitchen is improperly placed, and paved with pebbles, and there is no infirmary.

I In attending the service here on a Sunday, I observed some of the debtors much affected at this passage in one of the psalms which was read that day, O let the forrimfulfgbing of the prisoners come before ihee% Psal. lxxix, 12. which gave me the hint of taking it'for a motto to my present publication.

Lord , on the summer circuit 1787,

very humanely interceded for the pardon of nine of the best behaved convicts, and I hear that their conduct since has ihewn them worthy of the favour.

Debtors committed to this gaol in 1778, 109; 1779, 133; 1780, 126; 1781,96; 1782, 121; 1783, 120;

In this county the law is more /evert against debtors than in any other, owing to the court of common pleas that is held in it. The proceedings against debtors who are arrested by process from that court are ruled by the assizes, and not by the terms of the courts above; lb that a debtor may stay in gaol twelve months before the plaintiff files his declaration: whereas a debtor in London, York &c. is declared against in two terms. If the plaintiff proceed, it is two years before he can take the benefit of the Atts of Parliament, though his debt be only £ 10. Gaoler’s salary £. 210 in lieu of the tap, fees, chamber rent &c. Several debtors came in at the close of a former year, in hopes of an insolvenc act. 1787, Dec. 29, Debtors 53. Felons &c. 65, including 37 Convidts.

COUNTY GAOL, IN THE CASTLE OF LANCASTER*

I. No abuse, ill-treatment, quarrelling, or affray to be suffered amongst the prisoners; nor drunkenness, cursing, swearing, obscene or indecent language, nor gaining by dice, cards, or any other method whatsoever, on pain of being punished by closer confinement, fettering, and withholding their allowance;

* Dr. M* Far lan, one of the miniilers of Canongate, Edinburgh; in his Inquiries concerning the Poor9, (1782.) fays, that “ the habit of drinking spirituous liquors to excess has become so frequent among the common people, that we can hardly walk the streets without seeing its shocking effects. There is ko vice that has ruined a greater number of trade/men, or brought more families to misery, than this. Its effects, in general, are such, that, before mid-day the unhappy viflim is unqualified for business. Artificially exhilarated, he goes on, regardless of the consequences; and docs not retire from the scene of dissipation, till both his money and credit are exhausted. In a very short time, the whole frame is debilitated, and he is rendered incapable of any continued labour. When this practice is confirmed by habit, they must have recourse to strong liquors to brace their trembling nerves; so that, even in the moll abje<5l flnte of poverty, every pittance they receive is expended in this manner. It is an ckjett worthy of the attention of the legislature, and of every friend to mankind, to do what is poj/ble to restrain so great an evil.” f It may be asked, of what size I would wilh prisoners’ solitary night-rooms to be ? I answer, ten feet long, ten feet high, and eight feet wide; thus adopting a mean between the two extremes allowed by the act of parliament for penitentiary houses. (19th Geo. III.). Warming the rooms in any manner is unaecessary to those in health; but the sick mull be provided for.

I. Instead of /even days, the gaoler’s power to punlfh should, in my opinion, be limited to three days.

VIII. I was sorry to find that the magistrates had made no provision for the execution of this order.

X. By this good rule the keeper should have been limited as to the number of his dogs; for none should be permitted to have more than one or two.

XV. This seems too great an allowance, especially tb convicts.

XVII. I hope the magistratet will be very attentive to this good regulation.

XXI. Every regulation should be explicit. I have heard surgeons complain that they did not know who were included among those denominated poor debtors. In prisons where there are free wards, I should call those poor debtors who do not pay for a room or bed.

# By a careful inspection of the countenances of criminals in this and some other prisons, I am fully persuaded that the abolition of the tap is greatly conducive to their health. Their little money is now more generally spent in wholesome food, and they do not fell their bread allowance to buy liquors. In the northern counties of England milk is only ^ halfpenny a quart, and oatmeal, which is much used by prisoners, is about if d, a pound. Ten ounces boiled in water, with a little salt and butter, make a good mess, which is here called water pottage; or if boiled with a little sugar and currants is called gruel.—Groats and water well boiled, and parboiled currants, will keep two or three days, and, when warmed and sweetened, I think will make a good medicine for the sick in prisons; and good vegetable soup is better than meat soup. If I might advise as to drink, tea is a wholesome and good liquor; and not only prisoners, but, as I have often found, sailors when sick, are very fond of it*

The corporation have spared no expense for the new gaol which Mr. Blackburn is employed in building: there will be a proper separation of the different clafies and sexes; and with a view to security, health, reformation and convenience, I apprehend, it will be one of the first borough gaols in the kingdom.

LIVERPOOL Bridewell. No alteration. The keeper’s apartments having no view into either of the courts, may be one reason that both sexes were locked up. All the men were in heavy irons, and seven out of eight women were chained to the floors, and in bed at noon on Sunday, having had no fire for several days. * The next day, two being thus chained, at my desire, they were released and set to picking oakum.

• All the bedding was on the floors; for the bedsteads were laid in the upper rooms, because some of the prisoners had made a fort of ladder with them to get' through the floor above, in order to facilitate an escape. But bedsteads and bedding are necessary for the health of prisoners; and escapes would be prevented by confinement in separate cells. In some of the cells solid stone or brick might be worked into the walls, about eighteen inches from the floor, and cased with oak planks raised at the head, on which the bedding might be laid, as I have (een in some foreign prisons.

k f In Chester city gaol, Liverpool bridewell, and other prisons; I told the keepers that steady, lenient and persuasive methods with prisoners, are the best jneans to prevent them from breaking out; for their minds being uneasy, and their bodies harrafled, they are often driven to desperate attempts, which sometimes will be fuc-cefsful; and I mentioned the good effedb of such measures at Oxford castle.

t In the poor-house, which is finely situated near the bridewell, there were near a thousand inhabitants.

Five shillings a month is allowed for tobaecm and snuff, yet the use of tea, though purchased with their own money, is ordered to be punished by confinement in the dungeon. Aug. 1, 1788, there were eleven men, sixteen women, ten boys, seven girls.

COUNTY GAOL at FLINT.

A new gaol, built on a fine spot in the caftk yard, similar to that at Ruthin. It is not kept clean, nor has it been white-washed since it was built; a fault too common in new gaols. The pump in the felons’ court, as in many other gaols, out of order. Neither the clauses against spirituous liquors, nor the act for preserving the health of prisoners, hung up. Debtors have the county allowance. The costs being more than the debts, I copy the back of two of the warrants! debt 13 s. 3d. costs 15*. 6 d. — Debt£ 1: 19: o, costs £2:4:0. Gaoler’s salary now £ 45; and he has no chamber rent of the debtors.

filthy effects of which are more loathsome than can be well conceived, and very opposite to that spirit of clean-liness one would eameflly wish to inculcate. This indulgence is also creeping into gaols; and if I be not mif-informed, the gaoler of this county makes a constant charge on that account, which is allowed. I suppose this practice in prisons and other crowded places has been favoured with a view of counteracting infection by means of the smoke; but where proper means are used for admission of frefti air, no fumigation is necessary; and where it is thought advantageous, much more effectual methods of applying the fume, as well as fumes of a more salutary nature, may easily be adopted. On the other hand, tea is rigorously prohibited in these hoUfes, though, in my opinion, it is one of the mod innocent luxuries, and when used with milk and sugar, is a wholesome as well as an agreeable beverage. And what can be*a more proper encouragement to those who distinguish themselves by their cleanliness and industry, than rewarding them with an indulgence which renews one of the comforts, perhaps, of more prosperous days 5 and which is neither hurtful to themselves, nor offensive to others ? — I could wish that all old and dnfirm people, in all parish work-houses, had one third of their earnings, as is the case at Hamburg &c. which I am persuaded would even be for the advantage of such parishes.

Before I conclude this subject of work-houses, I mull add, that I by no means approve of the idea of parishes giving no relief to persons out of their work-houses; for, even the best establishments of this kind have fomc-thing in them repugnant to the feelings of an Englishmen. An ingenious writer has proposed parish work-shops (fimila* to what I have mentioned at Vienna): and was not Mr. Henry Fielding*s proposal of the fame nature ? u that poor people might relieve themselves; and by repairing to them in the day-time, and receiving what they « earned, they would be enabled to return to the comforts of their own fire fide, and be at liberty to en* M gage in any other occupation that might offer.” « For the original inflitution of the poor laws is, in Judge u Blackstone's words, to relieve the impotent poor, and them only; and to find employment for such as are able “ to work: a plan more humane and beneficial than even feeding and clothing of millions, by affording them the “ means (with proper industry) to feed and clothe themselves.”

If all parishes were to procure the means of labour, both for men and women, I am persuaded it would keep many out of those places of confinement, parish work-houses: and as for such persons as have nothing but their labour by which to support themselves, they should be compelled to work, in well regulated houses of correction, unless in cases of sickness, age and incapacity.

. 1788, May 22, Debtor 1.

In my various joumiej in England and Wales, I have seen many houses defaced on account of the odious tax on windows; and I cannot help repeating my concern for its pernicious effects. I am persuaded it has a very bad influence on the health of the lower classes of people; and this may be one reason of their not having now such healthy, ruddy complexions as they had formerly. The farmers’ servants having been crowded into unventilated rooms or holes, and our labouring poor having been habituated to close habitations, they dislike,

when they come into wo^-houses or hospitals, the admission of fresh air.

\

• Before I quit this subject, I would just mention, that in all my visits to the gaols and prisons, in this, and other kingdoms, I never received any insults either from keepers or prisoners; nor have I loft any thing in any of them, except, that in one of our prisons I once loft a large new handkerchief out of my pocket, which I did not raifs for some time, but on a subsequent visit, about ten months after, it was immediately presented to me by a prisoner; as, he said, he believed I had dropped it when I was there last.

Tin HULKS os the THAMES/

At both my visits, the hulks were clean, the bread good, the prisoners healthy, and many were at work. The hospital ship was cleaner and quieter than most of our county hospitals. Several convicts were lately come from the county gaols, and the captain justly observed, how different the health and complexion of such prisoners are now, from what they were when I first visited the hulks.—But 1 must repeat my complaint, that such an assemblage is entirely destrudtive to the morals of young convicts: the profaneness of the prisoners is not properly checked j and some of the guards set them a example.

March 26th, 1787, the number of convicts was 54.9, of whom the JuJlitia had 246, the Cenjor 229, and the Ceres 74. Of these thirty-six were in the hospital ship, eleven from the 'JuJlitia, twelve from the Cenjor, and thirteen from the

July 16th, 1788, the number was 741. The JuJlitia had two hundred and sixty-five, the Cenjor two hundred and forty-eight, and the Staniflaus two hundred and twenty-eight.

From the JuJlitia ninety, and from the Staniflaus one hundred and thirty-two, were at work on the shore, and in the ballast lighters.

In the hospital ship were 3 2 j from the JuJlitia twelve, from the Cenjor twelve, and from the Staniflaus eight.

The HULK at PLYMOUTH.

November 10th, 1787, the convicts at Plymouth dock were on board the hulk of the Chatham, a seventy gun ship, and were healthy and well j but the Dunkirk, which is more commodious, was repairing for them. Their bread, beef and beer were good; but the bread allowance of 4 lb.a day to fix men, is not sufficient. There were among them many fine young fellows, who all lived in total idleness, though some useful employment might here easily be found. There were ninety-two men and one woman: nine more convicts were coming on board from the gaol at Glamorgan.

June 28th, 1788, there were three hundred and sixty-six convicts in the Dunkirk, which was fitted up with several separate rooms. In one of the rooms, fifcy-seven feet by eighteen, and fix feet high, there were sixty-eight. Sudh a room, at night, when the hatches are down, must be very offensive. At one end, there is a room called the infirmary, and a recovery ward •, in the former were seven convicts, and in the latter thirteen. The meat was sweet, but the bread not good, and the beer thick.

The prisoners were all in total idleness, except six or seven who were making a boat for the captain. One ingenious man had made a small ink-stand (which I have by me) out of a bone of his meat; but his knife was taken from him. I saw some with bibles in their hands; but here is no chaplain, nor any religious service. Here also some of the keepers, by their profaneness, set a bad example to die prisoners.

Three

HULKS.

*17

Three miserable objects, for attempting to break out, were let down into a dreadful, dark and deep hole at the bottom of the ship, where they lay, almost naked, upon a litde straw j but, having been thus confined for some weeks, upon their earned entreaties, I obtained their release.

The HULK at GOSPORT.

At Gosport, July 7th, 1788, there were two hundred and seventy-three convicts in the bulk of an old Indiaman, called the Lion, which was moored here May ift, 1788. The ship was clean, and the prisoners had a healthy and placid look; but they lay two on a bed, with one blanket. Here were several to be transported for life, and some whole sentences were for a short term: among them were boys of only ten years of age. About one hundred and fifty of them were on shore, moving mould, who had irons on both legs, and a chain between them. Five carpenters were fitting up rooms for them to dine in, on shore} which is much better than returning at noon to the hulk, as the con-vi<£ts do on the Thames.

The HULKS near PORTSMOUTH.

At Langfton harbour, near Portsmouth, are three hulks. In (formerly

a French thirty-six gun frigate) there were, July 8th, 1788, three hundred and thirty-eight convicts. In the Ceres, which was the receiving ship at Woolwich, and was brought round here July ift, 1788, were two hundred and nineteen convicts. The other is an old hulk, now fitting up for an hosp ship. Two hundred and thirty of the convicts of the Fortunee, and one hundred and four of the Ceres, were at work on

Cumberland Fort; nineteen of them as masons, fix as carpenters, and the rest as labourers. Most of these were unloading the ships, and carrying (tones to different parts of the new works. They dine on shore at twelve o’clock. Their bread and beer were good, but they complained sadly of the meat, and indeed not without cause j for the beef was very lean, foil of bones, and not half the allowance, one pound to each man before it is dressed. The diet table which I had formerly seen in the cabin of the JuJlitia I here copy.

Each mt/s is for fix men, with seven pounds of bread every day.

All who are employed in the public works on shore have, each day they work, one pint of small beer, the king’s allowance. Molt of them had a ring on one leg, and the other ring fattened to their waiftband.

Both the ships were clean, particularly the Ceres. The had few sick in that

part called the hospital i but the Ceres had many more sick than the hospital part could contain, j- Several had the gaol-fever, and a few, petechiae. — Six out of ten that went from Bedford were dead> and two of the others were very Jtckly and dispirited. J—The convicts lie two on a straw bed, with one blanket; and after one is taken ill, his companion soon fickeits. Some few have hammocks, which in every view are better, and I wish they were in general use, except in the hospital ships. The Ceres being an old receiving ship, may be one cause of its being contaminated with infection> and most of the convicts here are from the country. There is not however, in general, that attention to cleanliness in the clothes, linen, and persons of the prisoners in the hulks which is necessary to preserve their health: for though some were decendy clothed in their own clothes, others were in rags i many without Ihirts. All should be clothed in a sailor's , of jacket, trowsers

&c. and I could wilh that the whole of Saturday were appropriated to cleanliness, viz. bathing, walhing and mending their clothes, lhaving, cleaning themselves and every part of the ships, and beating and airing their bedding. Thus endeavouring to introduce habits of cleanliness is an object of great importance j as many officers have observed, “ that the * most cleanly men are always the most decent and honest, and the most slovenly and “ dirty are the most vicious and irregular.” On other daysy none who are able should be excused from work. There were in the Fortunee one hundred excused from work, though the ship was healthy.

It would be better if there were a diet table painted and bung up in every hulk, for the inspection of the convicts j and if they were permitted to choose two of their number to fee that justice is done to them, as in the ninth article of the rules for the prisoners of war, which I formerly published; and proper scales, weights and measures ought to be kept for their use. There should also be a table of rules and orders, limilar to that for

• It is asserted by some persons, and government are made to believe it, that these convicts do more work than common day-labourers. But, from the frequent observation of them, I am convinced the contrary is the truth; and indeed, how could it be expected that men who labour involuntarily, with /canty diet, and small encouragement, should exert themselves with as much spirit as those who have the pleasing idea of a wife and children to /bare in their gains

*f* At my vilit to the Hospital of the galley slaves at Naples, which is on the pore fronting the bay, on my telling thzfurgeon, that in some countries a part of each galley is made an hospital (alluding in my mind to our hulks); he replied, “ that mull soon make the whole an hospital.”

t The gaoler at Reading told me, July 12th, 1788, that of the eleven convicts whom he carried on board the hulks, April ill, 1787, all were dead but three. I have observed, that convicts from the country often pine away and die without any apparent sign of iliness; and that of equal numbers, from the country, &nd from Newgate, three or four of the former die for eue of the latter.

prisoners of war, with a strict: prohibition against which, I am sorry to say, is

particularly necessary for the guards of these convicts. A gentleman of reputation should be appointed as commissary, to whom the prisoners, in case of cruelty or injustice, might immediately appeal j and who also should fee that the money allowed by government, at the end of their term, be given them. See Act 16th Geo. III. 43. and Act 24th Geo. III. cap. 12. fest. 6. By this act, and another of the same year cap. 56. fest. 9. it is declared, “ That all the time during which any offender, shall have continued in gaol * under sentence of transportation, or being removed under the provisions aforesaid, shall “ continue confined by virtue of this act, shall be taken and reckoned in discharge, or part “ discharge, or satisfaction of the term of his traiifportation.” Some of the convicts were sentenced for life, others for fourteen, seven, five, or three years: among these were boys; and all associating together without distinction. Is it not contrary to justice and humanity to fend convicts who are not sentenced for life, to a settlement so remote that there is no probability of their return; and a (till greater hardship to those who are sent after they have been four or five years and upwards in confinement, as some were in the last fleet to Botany Bay

I think it will be admitted that the mode of confinement and labour in the hulks is too severe for the far greater number of those who are confined in them. At the same time, there is no proportion of punishment to the several offences, and consequently, no distinction of guilt j which many wise legislators have long lamented as an evil which wants to be remedied.

• The great mortality that has happened among the canvi&s from the time they were first put on board

the JujUtia hullc at Woolwich, in August 1776, does not, I am persuaded, proceed from their bein^ confined on the water; (though in many other views I dislike this mode of confinement): as, from the general practice offoreigner 1 in building their prisons, hospitals and poor-house*, near the wafer, it seems, that they have no apprehension of bad consequences arising from such a situation. Dr. Heberden has expressed his sentiments on this subject in the Medical Transactions, pages 521, 524. “ In England few make any doubt of the great danger at-

“ tending wet rooms.-—Is this opinion founded upon experience, or is it a prejudice, which has been suffered to “ grow up, and get strength, merely for want of being examined ? If we inquire into the arguments in favour “ of this notion, we shall hardly find any other, than the random conjectures of the sick about the cause of “ their illness; or than their artfully substituting this origin of it instead of some other, which they are unwilling “ to own.—The air from rivers and from the sea is probably more replenished with vapors, than inland countries “ cleared of their woods; yet the most celebrated of ancient physicians recommended the bank of a running “ river for the situation of a house, on account of its peculiar healthiness; and many invalids are sent by the 4i modern physicians to the sea fide, only for the benefit of the sea air/*

THE Att for establishing Penitentiary Hou/es, drawn up by two of the wisest men this

kingdom has produced, was * a work of long and continued labour and inquiry,” and the legislature fully expressed their wife and humane sentiments in the following terms j “ that “ if many offenders convicted of crimes for which transportation has been usually inflicted, “ were ordered to Jolitary imprisonment, accompanied by well regulated labour, and religious * instruction, it might be the means, under Providence, not only of deterring others “ from the commission of the like crimes, but also of reforming the individuals, and <{ inuring them to habits of industry.”* Such a great and comprehenfivt plan will

may be proper to -alter. The time for which some of the convicts are to be committed

to the intended Penitentiary houses, viz. some one year, some two years. Such criminals seem more proper for the county houses of correction: for is it possible to think of any reformation in a conviCl^ behaviour, that is likely to prove lasting, in the compafo of a year ? I could with to have all such as are not to remain in a Penitentiary house five-years, at It aft, disposed of in some other manner.

The term Penitentiary clearly shews that parliament had chiefly in view the reformation and amendment of those to be committed to such places of confinement.

To these houses, however, I should wilh that none but old, hardened offefiders, and those who have, as the laws now Hand, forfeited their lives by robbery, house-breaking, and similar crimes, should be committed; or in Ihort, those criminals who are to be confined for a long term, or for life. I wilh that no persons might suffer capitally but for murder — for Jetting houses on fire .— and for house-breaking, attended with acts of cruelty. Our present laws are certainly too sanguinary, and are therefore ill executed; which last: circumstance, by encouraging offenders to hope that they may escape punishment, even after conviction, greatly tends to increase the number of crimes. Yet many are brought to a premature end, who might have been made ufofiil to the state. Indeed, I the more earnestly embarked in the scheme of erecting Penitentiary houses, from seeing cart loads of our fellow creatures carried to execution, “ though the generous nature of our countrymen rarely permits them to perpetrate acts of cruelty,” when at the same time I was fully persuaded that many of those unhappy wretches, by regular, steady discipline in a Penitentiary house, would have been rendered ufefol members of society; and above all, from the pleasing hope, that such a plan might be. the means of promoting the salvation of some individuals; of which, every instance is, according to the unerring word of truth, a more important object, than the gaining of the whole world.

The Penitentiary houses I would have built,in a great measure, by the convicts. I will suppose that a power is obtained from parliament to employ such of them as are now at work on the Thames, or some of those who are in the county gaols, under sentence of transportation, as may be thought most expedient. — In the first place, let the surrounding wall, intended for full security against escapes, be completed, and proper lodges for the gate-keepers. — Let temporary buildings, of the nature of barracks, be erected in some part of this enclosure which will be wanted the least, till the whole is finished. Let one or two hundred men, with their proper keepers, and under the directions of the builder, be employed in levelling the ground, digging out the foundation, serving the masons, sawing the timber and stone: and as I have found several convicts who were carpenters, masons, and smiths, these may be employed in their own branches of trade} since such work is as necessary and proper as any other in which they can

be engaged. L,et the people thus employed chiefly consist of thofe—whole term is nearly expired—or, who are committed for a short term j and as the ground is suitably prepared for the builders, the garden made, the wells dug, and the building finished, let those who are to be dismissed go off gradually; as it would be very improper to fend them back to the hulks or gaols again. By this method, they may be kept most usefully employed', and at the same time, by regular labour, some degree of separation, and proper conduit of their overseer6 to them, they may perhaps be a little reformed: for, except their keepers, and the directors of the works, they will be no more intermixed with other people than where they are now, at Woolwich, Portsmouth, or Gosport. *—I have not considered

this scheme superficially, though I can bear being told, it is absurd. Many have been reclaimed and made useful members of society, in foreign houses of correction, and have ^ thanked God for their confinement in them: these houses are called in Holland buizen, that is, bettering houses: and, the settled object in all such houses should be, to make men better j at least, more useful subjects. Their earnings constitute, in my opinion, but a secondary consideration: for surely, it is impossible to place any degree of profit in competition with the prospect of meliorating the minds of our fellow creatures.

The object I am sensible is great, but it is ufcfol. If I should not be able to accomplish this good work, I would Hill endeavour to bring materials, and lay the foundation; that others, of more (kill, may afterwards undertake the benevolent talk, and carry to perfection a plan, worthy of the great Sir William Blackstone, with whom I had the honour of much converfadon on this subject; a man, of such valt extent of capacity, as to have comprehended, in one enlarged view, the whole fabric of our laws; who was able to reduce them to a regular system; and, who further possessed, what is rarely united to great abilides, covftancy to execute his immortal work.

This great and good man Dr. Fothergill saw just before he died, to whom he then turned, and alked t( what progress we had made in the Penitentiary houses.” The doCtor answered, that we had paid all poflibk attention to the sentiments of others respecting a situ-adon, that we must soon be obliged to request the opinion of our judges concerning it, and till this was obtained, we could not proceed much farther.—Be firm in your own, was all that he was able to say, as he soon after departed to a better life.

* From greater experience, and longer bfervation, I am more confirmed in a remark that I formerly made on the notion, that catrviBs are ungovernable, which is certainly erroneous. There is a mode of managing some of the most desperate, with ease to yourself, and advantage to them. Many such are Ihrewd and sensible. bet them be managed with calmness, yet with steadiness: shew them that you have humanity, and that you aim to make them useful members of society: and let them fee and hear the rules and orders of the prison, that they may be convinced they are not defrauded in their provisions or clothes, by contraflors or gaolers. When they are ‘fick, let them be treated with tenderness. Such conduit would prevent mutiny in prisons, and attempts to escape; which I am fully persuaded are often owing to prisoners being made desperate, by the profaneness, inhumanity and ill usage of their keepers.

This account of the Judge’s last conversation I received, in a letter from the doctor, Rim a me*

in January 1780; as I was then attending the press at Warrington. I shall take the liberty

to copy verbatim my immediate answer to that letter. tia*t

. . ^ House 1.

Mr. Justice Blackstone's dying words, Be firm in your own ,seem to me the mod important direction for our conduit. We are fixed upon as the proper persons to determine upon a plan, situation &c. of a Penitentiary house. Why then transfer the office to other persons, whose station of life, and other engagements mult render them very unfit for entering into such a matter ? Let us, when we meet, absolutely fix upon one situation, as the belt on the whole, according to our ideas; and specifying our reasons, let us submit the approbation or rejection of this one plan, to those in whom the law has veiled such a power; but not give them the unnecessary trouble, or us the improper degradation, of determining, in our Head, the relpeitive advantages of several different plans. I am sensible that many amendments will occur in the execution of every part of this plan; but these mull be the refiilt of experience, as we go on. At any rate, we are the proper judges of that part which the law has committed to us, and ought to follow our own ideas with firmnejst without depending upon the superior judgment of others.

On my return from Lancashire, the doctor and I fixed on a spot at Islington, our colleague, Mr. Whatley, preferring one at Limehouse.

I shall now give the reasons why Dr. Fothergill and myself fixed on two enclosures at IJlmgtony as proper sites for the Penitentiary houses, for male and female convicts; as it may afford some hints, should such a plan, in future, be adopted.

This situation possesses the following advantages) some of which are expressly pointed out in the act for erecting these houses.

I. The situation is healthy.

II. Water is to be had on the premises; of which large supplies ipay be obtained from the White Conduit, the property of the Charter-house, but now unnecessary to them; as they are more conveniendy supplied by the New River Company.

III. Should both these sources fail, or prove insufficient, any requisite quantity of water may be had from the New River Company.

IV. It is remote from any houses; and so much ground may be purchased, as to prevent other buildings from being ere died in its neighbourhood: circumstances particularly adverted to in the alt providing for these establifhments. We apprehended the benefit to be derived from these houses would, in a great degree, depend upon the constant attention of the persons appointed to the government of the institution, the first of its kind in the nation, and deiigned as a model for others in different parts of the kingdom: and as we thought the intention of the all was, by {blitary confinement, well regulated labour, and religious instruction, to reform, as well as to punish for pafl offences, and

were convinced that these great ends cannot be so easily effected at a from

London, as in its neighbourhood, on account of the difficulty of prevailing upon proper persons to undertake the charge of the institution i we were induced by these confederations, from a sense of duty to the present and to future ages, to fix upon a place as near the centre of the metropolis as is consistent with the just and salutary views of the legislature. — Among other alterations and amendments which seem very desirable in the present act; I could wish the judges, and their successors, to be constituted perpetual guardians of the Penitentiary houses'. In this case, vicinity to the Metropolis will be essential to a proper situation for them; and, were there no other advantage to recommend it, I think a proper inspection so absolutely necessary to the good government of Penitentiary houses, that neither expen/e, nor a few other conveniences, ought to be set in competition with so important a circumstance.

V. Dr. Fothergill and I apprehended, there would be a considerable advantage at Islington in the ready supply of suitable provisions, such as the coarser parts of shambles meat} which, even from the finest animals, may be purchased at a cheaper rate than other pieces } but which can scarcely be collected, in sufficient quantity, except from die markets of the metropolis.

• VI. It would be difficult to employ the conviCts in raising large quantities of garden productions with security:they must also in this case, have frequent, and unavoidable intercourse with other people} and, so near to London, employing them in this manner would be attended with loss; as all kinds of garden produce may be bought there much cheaper than it can be raised, by forced labour.

VII. Except the houses were ereCted on the fide of the Thames (where we could not find a spacious and proper spot in the vicinity of London or Westminster) or on a navigable canal, both food, and the heavy materials on which the conviCts are to be employed, would be brought cheaper to Islington, than to any other place so near the centre of the metropolis.

VIII. Should the conviCts ever form a desperate design of effecting their escape, assistance to quell any such attempt might be much more easily procured at Islington, than at any more distant place. The assistants at Clerkenwell, at Newgate and the Compter, as well as the soldiers quartered in the neighbourhood, might soon be convened, and in sufficient numbers, for tins purpose. * And, indeed, the certainty of such assistance being at hand, might discourage any such conspiracies: whereas, if the houses were remote, and but slenderly guarded, the officers of them might sometimes fall a sacrifice to the desperate rashness of the conviCts.

• My studious friend, Mr. Loft, joins with Dr. JM in controverting my idea upon this point: one telling me “ that in no particular or possible circumstance the interference of the establiftied army should be admitted.” The other: u that the objections against employing the military are numerous, obvious, weighty, and irresistibly *ondufive.”

IX. No small difficulty and expense to the counties are at present incurred in fending their convicts to Woolwich and Plymouth, by reason of their distance from London: for when the convicts come at night to town, they are to be lodged, and securely guarded at a considerable expense, till they are admitted to the hulks. This difficulty

* and expense would be prevented by their immediate admission at Islington.

X. I allege, that the expense of building is less, in the neighbourhood of London, than at a distance from it. Perhaps it may be said that land will be cheaper in proportion farther from the capital. To this I only reply, that the Ipot at Islington would probably have come cheaper, at the time it was proposed,. than an equal extent in any other part, about London: but that, for a building which is intended for public utility, and which is to endure for ages, the difference in the price of land, between one situation and another, is, in my view, a consideration of no weight.—A Penitentiary house for male convicts, erected at Islington, would have this further advantage, that it would be seen by multitudes} yet, be lb placed and defended, that no communication could be had with the convicts. Some of them might be seen at labour; or correction, if necessary; and so exhibit an instrudtive lesson to others, who might be treading in the fame paths that brought them to such a state of confinement and punishment.

The Penitentiary house for femaleconvidts, and its inhabitants, the doctor and I intended to be totally secluded from the observation of any, by the strudhire of the building. But the lame advantages with respect to healthinels, * water, inspection, provisions, fuel, and materials for labour, would also be found in it. However, I acknowledge it has always appeared to me, that some little difficulty will arise in regard to the proper management of a house of this kind. If men are to be employed in it, great care mull be taken who are trusted in such a place. If women, which I should prefer upon the whole, it will not be easy to find such as have prudence enough to govern without either tyranny on the one hand, or too much imbecillity and relaxation of discipline on the other. Yet, probably it will be a greater difficulty to find men, though of as Heady principles as most we can expect to meet with, who will keep clear, as they ought to do, of all partialities. This 1 know from my observations in gaols. But

# In relpedl to htalthinefs, the situation at Islington it much more eligible than any of the populous parts of the city —fo that by providing airy apartments, free ventilation, plenty of water; and by promoting cleanliness, accompanied with wholesome food, and a proper degree of labour; the convicts may there enjoy better health than falls to the lot of many thousands of reputable tradesmen and mechanics: and at the same time, these Penitentiary houses would not be so near any other buildings as to facilitate escapes, of prove an annoyance to the neighbourhood.—I will only add, that when I was supervisor, I listened with eagerness and impartiality to every situation that was proposed, visited the places, and attended to the various opinions that were suggested to me on the subject: nevertheless, upon the moll mature deliberation, I am fiill of the fame opinion, that taking all things together, Islington is the most proper, and bejt Ipot, on which to build the Penitentiary houses.

perhaps among a greater number of prisoners, as in Penitentiary houses, the danger would be less.

A proper plan for the government of Penitentiary^ houses is of great importance, and is snore practicable than some fulpeft. I am aware indeed of the difficulty of accomplishing so arduous an undertaking as that of reforming criminals, and inuring them to habits of induftryj yet, when it is for the public good, we ought to make experiments j and indeed, what have I been doing in c oik Sting the regulations of some of the beji directed houses of correction in Europe, and such as experience has proved to be praSlicable, but endeavouring to facilitate the execution of this ujeful design ? The , ,

and order, that I observed in die houses of correction in Holland, Hamburg, Bern,

Ghent, Florence &c. I am fully persuaded, proceeded, in a great degree, from the constant attention that is paid to impress the prisoners with a sense of religion, by plain, serious difoourfe, catechising and familiar instruction from the chaplains, together with the influence of a good example, both in them and the keepers. These circumstances make a much greater impression upon the minds of criminals, when in prison, than they would have done before they came there. We have too much adopted the gothic mode of correction, viz. by rigorous severity, which often hardens the heart} while many foreigners pursue the more rational plan of softening the mind in order to its amendment.

I hope I shall be excused in repeating some general hints on this subject, as an outline for the government of such houses.

• Many friendly hours have I spent with Dr. Fothergill\ and several of these observations are taken from hints which he fuggelled. Indeed, our sentiments on this subject so exactly coincided, that I absolutely refused ailing as a supervisor of the Penitentiary houses, unlfs Dr. Fothergill were joined with me in the office; which his Majesty graciously condescended to grant. But, the constant opposition we met with from some of those whom the act appointed judges of the situation, plans &c. would, I am persuaded, have induced the doctor, had he lived, as well as myself, to have resigned the supervisorship of those houses. I here take the liberty of introducing my letter of resignation, addressed to Earl Batburjl, Lord President of the Privy Council* in January 1781, soon after Dr. Fothergill*s death.

MY LORD,

When Sir William Blackstone prevailed upon me to act as a supervisor of the buildings intended for the confinement of certain criminals, I was persuaded to think that my observations upon similar institutions in foreign countries would, in some degree, qualify me to assist in the execution of the statute of the 19th year of his present Majesty. With this hope, and the prospect of being associated with my late worthy friend Dr. Fothergill, whose wishes and ideas upon the subject I knew corresponded entirely with my own, I cheerfully accepted his Majesty’s appointment, and have since earnestly endeavoured to answer the purpose of it; but, at the end of two years, I have the mortification to fee that not evep a preliminary has been settled. The Jituation of the intended buildings has been made a matter of obstinate contention, and is at this moment undecided. J udging therefore from what is pa ft, that the further sacrifice of my time is not likely to contribute to the success of the plan, and being now deprived, by the death of Dr. jFothergill, of the assistance of an able colleague, I beg leave to signify to your Lordship my determination to decline all further concern in the business; and to desire that your Lordship will be so good as to lay before the King my humble request, that his Majesty will be graciously pleased to accept my resignation, and to appoint some other gentleman to the office of a supervisor in my place.

The lazaretto at Xante came up to my ideas of the construction of a Penitentiary house, or house of correction, more, I think, than any building I have yet seen. It also had that exposure to the salutary influence of the breezes, and that cheer-fulness of afpeCb, which are so necessary to relieve the languor attending fickneis and confinement.

I conclude this subject in the words of an elegant writer, in the prefatory observations on a draught of a bill to punish by imprisonment and hard L hour &c. that, * if " a beginning be once made, by adopting such a plan as may appear the least liable to * objections (for none can be entirely free from diem) it mull be left to time, expe-« rience, and the wisdom of subsequent sessions, to revise, improve, and mature it. « Many useful and essential amendments may, even at present, be expeCted from others « who will give their immediate attention: and much must ultimately depend on the « aCtive, judicious, and discreet concurrence of magistrates and gentlemen of weight in « the different parts of the kingdom: for it will be impossible, in the first introduction of “ so great an establishment, to foresee and prescribe the whole detail of rules necessary to « be observed; and indeed it will be better, in every respect, to leave that detail, under “ proper checks and restrictions, to be hereafter planned and settled in the several distriCts “ to be established.”

Peters- In my publication in 1784, I gave an account of a house of correction at Petersburg House which was then nearly finished. I was desirous of giving the plan; but the drawing

of not having been received in time for that publication, it is here inserted. (Seeplate xxi.)

• At Moscow, the ancient capital of Russia, I found no traces of any such prisons or dungeons as were common formerly in the cattles of England, and in several foreign countries. That cruel mode of confinement in many of our prisons, has been, and ttill is a principal cause of the gaol-fever; no symptoms of which did I fee in Petersburg, Moscow, or in any part of Russia*

I would wifti that the rooms for solitary confinement at night were not too small, and would plead for the cheering influence of light, as well as of air,in them. The lazaretto at Zante came up to my ideas of the construction of a Penitentiary house, or house of correction, more, I think, than any building I have yet seen. It also had that exposure to the salutary influence of the breezes, and that cheer-fulness of aspect, which are so necessary to relieve the languor attending sickness and confinement.

I conclude this subject in the words of an elegant writer, in the prefatory observations on a draught of a bill to punish by imprisonment and hard labour &c. that, if « a beginning be once made, by adopting such a plan as may appear the least liable to « objections (for none can be entirely free from them) it mult be left to time, expe-« rience, and the wisdom of subsequent sessions, to revise, improve, and mature it. « Many useful and efiential amendments may, even at present, be expeCted from others “ who will give their immediate attention: and much must ultimately depend on the « aCtive, judicious, and discreet concurrence of magistrates and gentlemen of weight in « the different parts of the kingdom: for it will be impossible, in the first introduction of « so great an establishment, to foresee and prescribe the whole detail of rules necessary to « be observed; and indeed it will be better, in every respect, to leave that detail, under “ proper checks and restrictions, to be hereafter planned and settled in the several distriCts * to be established.”

In my publication in 1784, I gave an account of a house of correction at Petersburg which was then nearly finished. I was desirous of giving the plan; but the drawing not having been received in time for that publication, it is here inserted. (Seeplate xxi.) It is an elegant, though plain building, with fifty-seven windows in front, and two galleries at the back-front, supported by pillars. There is an afeent of a few steps to the first floor; all the staircases are stone (five feet wide); the rooms are aboUt thirty-three feet by twenty-three; the windows fix feet from the floor j the cielings are lofty, in the middle of which are apertures, fourteen inches square; and the roof consists of thin on plates.

• At Mcfcowt the ancient capital of Russia, I found no traces of any such prisons or dungeons as were common formerly in the castles of England, and in several foreign countries. That cruel mode of confinement in many of our prisons, has been, and dill is a principal cause of the gaol-fever; no symptoms of which did I fee in Petersburg, Moscow, or in any part of Russia.

REMARKS

ON THE

GAOL-FEVER.*

I shall take the liberty here to subjoin a few additional remarks on the gaol-fever; in which, if I shall appear to have invaded the province of the gentlemen of the faculty, I hope to be pardoned, from the consideration that my experience in this matter may, in some degree, supply my want of other means of knowledge.

If it were asked, what is the cause of the gaol-fever? it would in general be readily replied, “ the want of fresh air and cleanliness.” But as I have found, in some prisons abroad, cells and dungeons as offejifive and dirty as any I have observed in this country, where, however, this distemper was unknown, I am obliged to look out for some additional cause of its production. I am of opinion, that the Hidden change of diet and lodging so affeCls the spirits of new convicts, that the general causes of putrid fevers exert an immediate effect upon them. Hence.it is common to fee them sicken and die in alhort time, with very little apparent illness. ConviCts are generally stout, robust young men, who have been accustomed to free diet, tolerable lodgings, and vigorous exercise. Thele are ironed, thrust into close offensive dungeons, and there chained down, some of them without straw or other bedding; here they continue, in winter, sixteen or (even-teen hours out of the twenty-four, in utter inactivity, and immerfod in the noxious effluvia of their own bodies. On this account, the gaol-distemper is always observed to reign more in our prisons during winter than summer ■,% contrary, I presume, to the nature of other putrid dileafes. Their fliet is at the same time low and scanty; they are generally without fifing; and the powers of life soon become incapable of relifting so many caules of sickness and despair.

• As the gaol-fever has an immediate connexion with the subjects on which I have been treating, for the fake of such readers as may not have seen what I have formerly said upon it, I here copy it, with a little variation, from my tail publication.

+ In conversation with the physician to the military hospital at Mofarw, on my observing that the windows of the wards were (hut, he answered; “ Almost all our disorders are in winter; for the Rnjjiani cndofe themselves in hot rooms, and didike the fresh air, even before the cold months commence.”

GAOL-FEVER.

Gaol.-

Fevir.

On my visits in 1779,1 found only one person ill of the gaol-fever: he was in Newgate, under sentence of death. In 1782, I did not find a single person labouring under that disorder throughout the whole kingdom. But in 1783, when the prisons became crowded in consequence of the peace, I was sorry to observe, that through the original faulty cott-Jirufiion of many of them, and the want of attention in magistrates properly to inspect them, and enforce the orders of the Act for preserving the health of prisoners, they were beginning to return to their former wretched state.

Several instances of alarming and fatal sickness in gaols have been communicated to me j some of which I have Jieen, and noted in their proper places. I have to remark, however, that it appears doubtful to me, whether, in some of these, the disorder was the proper gaol-fever, produced in and peculiar to such situations j or an epidemic disease, which attacked prisoners only in common with other inhabitants of the fame town. It cannot be expected that gaols should be preserved free from such visitations as these: it is only to be hoped, that care and attention will be used to prevent the disease from becoming more malignant and fatal in these, than in other places, f

• It may not be improper here to put persons on their guard against an artifice not unfrequently pra&ifcd by gaojers, in order to prevent a proper examination of their prisons. When a gentleman, particularly a magistrate, has come with an intention to visit the gaol, the keeper has pretended the utmost willingness to accompany him, but at the same time has artfully dropt a hint that he fears there may be some danger in it, as he is apprehen£ve that the fever has made its appearance among them. The vifitcr, alarmed, returns thanks for the kind caution, and instantly leaves the hoofe. — On such occasions I have always the more infilled on the necessity of a close inspection; and have generally found the prison very dirty, indeed, and out of order, but no fever.

f Since my return from Turkey, f have been frequently afleed what precautions I use, to preserve myself from infection; I here again answer, that next to the free goodness and mercy of the Author of my being, temperance and cleanliness are my chief preservatives. Trusting in Divine Providence, and believing myself in the way of my duty, I visit the mod infedlious hospitals and noxious cells; and while thus employed, I fear no evil.— However, I seldom enter an hospital or prison before breakfast; in an offensive room I avoid drawing my breath deeply; and on my return, sometimes walh my mouth and hands.

CONCLUSION.

IN my late inquiries into the state of the prifo of this country, it has given me Cowclv-sincere pleasure to find, that, from the attention of the and the operation *I0W‘

of the salutary Act for preserving the health of prisoners, the gaols of the Capital, though crowded, have been freed from that disease which formerly destroyed more persons than the hand of the executioner j and those in the country have been so much improved, that most of them may now be visited without hazard of infection j whilst the judges are secured from those risks which formerly attended them in the discharge of their important office. With satisfaction I have also observed the liberal and humane spirit which engages the public to alleviate the sufferings of prisoners in general, and particularly, to release many industrious, though unfortunate, debtors. But at this point, the spirit of improvement

unhappily seems to stop, scarcely touching upon that still more important object, the reformation of morals in our prisons: yet it is obvious that if this be neglected, besides the evil consequences that must result from such a source of wickedness, a suspicion will arise, that what has been already done has proceeded, chiefly, from the folfifh motive of avoiding the danger to our own health, in attending courts of judicature.

In this further reformation, it will be absolutely necessary to begin with the Capital: for as, in my former visits, when I have met with the gaol-fever in county prisons, I have been almost constantly told, that it was derived from those in London; so the corruption of manners also, flowing from that great fountain, spreads far and wide its malignant firearm. In what prison in London is there a proper separation of criminals, the old from the young, convicts from the untried? Where are the night-rooms for solitary confinement and reflection? Where is any proper attention paid to sick and dying prisoners ? Where are the rules and orders of magistrates for the direction of gaolers, and the government of prisoners ? In what gaol are not the ears shocked with the profaneness both of prisoners and turnkeys ? Where is any regard paid to the Lord's day ? Where is not the afternoon of that day a time of greater concourse of visitants than any other ? And, though the gaoler’s taps are abolished, yet, are not publicans continually waiting to serve the prisoners, and their company ? Is not beer now sold by the debtors ? And do not turnkeys keep flops in the gaols

CONCLUSION.

Conclu-

sion.

\

No effectual reform will be made in our prisons till the root of these evils be cut off, which, from the clofelt observation, I am convinced is the vice of drunkenness. To this end, restraints must be laid, which will, to many, I am sensible, appear harsh and severe; but, in this matter, there is medium: any indulgence to particular classes of prisoners will ruin the whole design. It will, in my idea, according to the annexed draught of a bill, be absolutely necessary to prohibit the introduction of any kind of liquor except milk, whey, butter-milk, or water into gaols; and in order to diminish the apparent hardship upon debtors, I heartily wish that such an alteration were made in our laws with respect to confinement for debt, that none should undergo it but dishonejl and fraudulent debtors. Such are criminals, and ought to be treated accordingly.

With regard to the health and real comfort of prisoners, I am persuaded, they would be promoted by such a prohibition. Within fourteen years, how many prisoners, together with their keepers, have I known destroyfed by drinking, and how many convicts, going out of the world, in a state of intoxication I Criminals are, for the most part, under the middle age of life, and therefore strong enough in constiturion to bear the trial of thoroughly breaking their bad habits j and as to , * who generally live in prisons in utter idleness, they can have little occasion for strong liquors, and would receive much more benefit from a litde addition of meat and vegetables to their diet, which, by this restriction, they might better afford, f

After all, the best laws will fail in their effect, unless the assiduous and zealous endeavours of magistrates be exerted in a strict attention to their execution. Abuses, though ever fb studiously guarded against, will creep in-, and it requires the utmost vigilance to detebl, and resolution to reform them. If I have been able to point out any of these, and to foggeft their causes and remedies, it has been by that close, attention to one object, which has in some measure supplied the want of original abilities, and given me clearer notions, and a more decided opinion upon these matters.

* Of this dafs how many persons have I known, or heard of, who have gone into prison fiber men; but, who have either destroyed themselves there by drinking, or have gone out mere fits

f If Gentlemen of the Faculty, and others, still object to the exduiion of all fermented liquors front gaols, under the idea that their use is in some measure necessary as antifeptks, I would desire them to consider, that by the proposed dietary prisoners are to have a •warm dish. chiefly of 'vegetables, twice a day; —and that of female prisoners, who in general drink very lktle beer, a {mail proportion, compared with the men, die in prison.—I am sensible my ideas are contrary to the present mode of prescription,

which, I am persuaded, confirms the habit of drinking strong liquors, both in town and country; but may I not hope, that the opittitns of medical gentlemen will, in time, alter as much upon thb subject, as I have seen in their treatment of the lrnall-pox I

CONCLUSION.

To my country I commit the result of my past labours. It is my intention again to Cohclv-quit it for the purpose of revisiting Rjtffia, Turkey, and some other countries, and ,tow* extending my tour in the East. I am not insensible of the dangers that must attend such a journey. Trolling, however, in the protection of that kind Providence which has hitherto preserved me, I calmly and cheerfully commit myself to the disposal of unerring wisdom. Should it please God to' cut off my life in the prosecution of this design, let not my conduCt be uncandidly imputed to rafhness or enthusiasm, but to a serious, deliberate conviction that I am pursuing the path of duty; and to a sincere desire of being made an instrument of more extensive usefulness to my fellow-creatures than could -be expected in the narrower circle of a retired life.

DRAUGHTOFABILL.

Whereas the good and wholesome Laws made for the better regulation of the Gaols Draught of this Kingdom, and for preventing Drunkenness and Rioting therein, have not proved sufficiently effectual to answer the purposes thereby intended. May it therefore please your Majesty ’that it may be enacted, and Be it enacted by the King’s most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual ' and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the . authority of the same.

applied to the use of the county stock; the said penalty to be sued for in any of his

Majesty’s courts of record at Westminster, by action of debt, bill, plaint or information; and in case any such gaoler or other officer, being convicted thereof as aforesaid, shall again offend in like manner, and be thereof a second time lawfully convicted, such second offence shall be deemed a forfeiture of his office.

And be it further enacted, that if any person or persons shall carry, or bring,

or attempt or endeavour by any clandestine ways or means to carry or bring, into any gaol, prison, or house of correction, any liquor of any fort or kind, other than milk, whey, butter-milk, or water; it {half be lawful for the gaol-keeper or other officer of such gaol, prison, or house of correction, or his or their servants to apprehend such

Provided always, and be it further enacted, that nothing herein before contained shall extend or be construed to extend to any person bringing liquors into the house of the gaoler for the use of the private family of the -said gaoler, or keeper of such house of correction, and delivering the fame into the hancU of the said gaoler; nor to any ■person bringing into any infirmary in any gaol or house of correction any liquor or medicine prescribed by any surgeon or apothecary appointed to attend such gaol or house of correction, and delivering the fame into the hands of such surgeon or apothecary or other person appointed by such surgeon or apothecary to receive the same.

And be it further enacted, that the several justices of the peace, at their quarter sessions assembled, are hereby authorised and required to order and direct the several articles mentioned and contained in the schedule hereunto annexed, to be delivered and supplied to any prisoner who shall be committed to any gaol, prison, or house of correction, for any treason, felony, trespafs or misdemeanor, for the subsistence and support of such prisoner, during the time of his confinement there; and shall likewise order and direct that the rooms in any gaol set apart as an infirmary for the lick prisoners shall be provided with a sufficient number of straw beds, the straw thereof to be changed once in every month at the least, and shall also direct a proper supply of sheets, rugs or other coverlets for the said beds, and also a proper quantity of linen, and necessary clothing to be worn by the said prisoners, and shall also order that from Michaelmas to Lady-Day a fire shall be kept in the room used by the said prisoners as their common or day-room; Provided always that no contract for the supply of any gaol with provisions, bedding, fuel, or any other articles whatsoever shall be made with any person or persons keeping any gaol, prison, or house of correction, or any other person employed in or about the fame, nor with any person for the use of any gaoler, or keeper of any prison or house of correction, fb that he or they shall have any interest therein, or benefit therefrom.

And be it further enacted, that die expenses attending the execution of the orders Drauoht of the said justices, made in pursuance of this Act, so far as the fame respects county Bill. gaols, shall be borne and defrayed out of the respective county rates; and so far as the fame shall respect the gaols and prisons of particular cities, towns corporate, liberties or places that do not contribute to die rates of the counties where they are respectively situated, such expenses shall be defrayed out of the public stock or rates of such cities, towns corporate, liberties or places, having an exclusive jurisdiction to which such gaols shall respectively belong.

And be it further enacted, that all prisoners adjudged to be guilty of felony shall be confined and kept separate from the other prisoners confined in such gaols, prisons, or houses of correction, and shall also be put in separate cells, apart from each other, by night, and all other prisoners committed for trial, or confined for the non-payment of fines, shall also be kept separate and apart by night, as far as the structure of the said several gaols in which they may be confined will admit.

And be it further enacted, that each cell or night-room shall be furnished with proper bedding &c. and that no prisoner or prisoners who are not disorderly shall be dofely confined in his or their cells or rooms; but they shall be out in the court or yard fbme hours every day.

whatsoever.

And whereas the great number of persons that daily resort to prisoners confined in the different gaols promotes rioting and debauchery, and tends to the commission of further crimes, and to facilitate escapes from the said gaols; Be it therefore enacted, that no person shall be admitted into any gaol, prison, or house of correction, to visit any prisoner therein confined for debt, but on three days of the week, namely, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and then only three persons on each of those days to each prisoner so confined, and that no person shall be admitted to visit any prisoner committed for any treason, felony, or breach of the peace, or misdemeanor, but on Friday in each week, and then only two persons on such day to each prisoner so confined.

I have visited all the county gaols, and almost all the other prisons; yet, as there are some few of the town prisons which I did not fee, if we add twenty to the number of prisoners, we shall probably have nearly the average number of persons confined at one time in the prisons in Ireland:

viz. Debtors - 550.

Criminals - 1004.

Suppofied omitted 20.

Total - - 1574.

N. B. Where I have visited twice, viz. in 1787 and 1788,1 have taken, in this estimate, the lafi number.

TABLE III.

An Account of the Number of Prisoners in the Gaols and of England and

Wales at the last Time they were visited in 1787, or 1788.

As Tome County Gaols are also the County Bridewells, where petty Offenders are not always separated from Felons, in those Places I sometimes include petty Offenders under the Article Felons — In this Table

I have omitted mentioning all those Prisons in which, at the times of my visiting in these two Years, there were no Persons confined.

Of the hundred and twenty Sessions in the fifteen Years of Peace (eight in a Tear) only one was Maiden# in 1749.—Of sixty-four Sessions in the eight Years of War, nine were Maiden.

Sir Stephen intending a lid only of those who were condemned to die, has not in his table a column for transport convicts. But at the bottom of the sheet he notes that there were

Transported for seven or fourteen years - . - - - 5199

To which number he adds

Transported by the King’s mercy (after receiving sentence of death) - 401

Total Transportt 5600

The second number of transports 401 is, doubtless, part of the number 443, the lad of the three totals above.

I persuade myself that my readers will txcufe the insertion of several Tables here which I have before given in my last publication, as this book may fall into the hands of some who have not the other in their possession. And may I not indulge the hope that, many years after I shall be dead and forgotten, these Tables, being of a public nature, will be occasionally reviewed, and may have inferences drawn from them which will, in their consequences, contribute to alleviate the mi/eries of mankind, and add something to the general Hock of happiness among the human race?

I SHALL

C *59 3

I shall now close this work with suggesting a plan which I think would, if adopted, be attended with public utility.

Since the office of a Gaoler or Keeper of a Prison is very important, and, when discharged with fidelity and humanity, deserves great encouragement; and as the late Act prohibits women from being keepers; I could wish that there should be a small provision made by an annuity for the widow or children of every faithful and attentive gaoler who dies in that office; not out of the succeeding gaoler’s salary, but clear and independent thereof. I have known some valuable keepers, and their wives, die of the gaol-fever; and is it not a distrefling consideradon that such persons, though they have properly attended to their duty, should leave families unprovided for ? Who would not regret that such men as George Smith, late keeper of Tothill-fields bridewell, should be exposed to the unhappiness of leaving a wife, or children, or both, without any comfortable provision for their support ? This objcdl appears the more desirable, as it may now be hoped that the abolition of the tap, and the allowance of salaries in lieu of the profits which were derived from the sale of liquors, will be the means of engaging people of more credit, and who will pay greater attention to their duty, to undertake the office of gaolers or keepers of prisons. Such persons I have observed to be placed in foreign prisons; and among them, some of their wives take a very active part, looking frequently in upon the prisoners of their own sex, and paying a kind attention to them.

Should the plan take place, during my life, of establishing a permanent charity, under some such title as that at Philadelphia, viz. A society for alleviating the miseries of public prisons, and annuities be engrafted thereupon for the abovementioned purpose, I would rnoft readily (land at the bottom of a page as a subscriber of £$oo; or if such a society shall be constituted within three years after my death, this sum shall be paid out of my eltate.

• Mr. George Smith, who died in 1786, was keeper of Tothill-fields bridewell at my first vijit in April 1774: and my many subsequent visits fully convinced me of his integrity and humanity. He was a firiking example of a con fl ant, unabated xeal in the dis charge of the important trufi repefed in him.

APPENDIX.

INTRODUCTION.

IN the account of the principal Lazarettos in Europe, Which I published the beginning of the year 1789,1 mentioned that it was my intention again to quit my country, for the purpose of re-visiting Russia, Turkey, and some other countries, and adding an Appendix to that work; as I wilhed to gain further knowledge on a subject that for some year# had engaged my attention j and with the hope that the torch of philanthropy might be conveyed into remote countries. In confidence on God, who had been my help, I cheerfully set out on my journey, and dame to Amsterdam the 7th of July, 1789 j where I firfk visited the hospitals for the sick.

In the City Hospital, the apertures that have been lately made in the ceiling of the Holland. men’s ward, make that room frdher than the women’s lofty ward; and I observed to Amster-the physician, whom I met on one of my visits, that in such long wards, a window, such as DAM’ was in Guy's Hospital, (of which I shewed him die model)' from the ceiling to the floor, would be proper. All the wards were clean; but the patients, neither in their linen nor persons, were so attentive to cleanliness as might have been wished; a fault which the pre- -judice of the faculty, relative to the unfalutarinefs of fresh linen, has to answer for. The black stone or marble floor made the doctor put on flippers over his shoes: I could not but wish the floor was boarded round the patients beds.

The Pest-house is out of the city. At both my visits, I had the pleasure to find every ward sweet and clean, the patients calm and quiet, and diat order that I wilh to find in all hospitals. This I the more readily mention, as the state of this house occasioned me to censure it in a former work. Here were 107 men and 129 women.

HOLLAND.

In the Stadt-house many judicious alterations have been made in the debtors’ room, by the worthy president, burgomaster Randclp; and in a further allowance to the aliment of prisoners. He, with Mr. Sheriff Hartfmck, did me the honor to accompany me into the dungeons, and other prison-rooms. The torture-chamber, and the different engines and modes of torture, to force a confession of a suspedted crime, I give no account of, as I know those amiable magistrates wish such a practice abolished. There were fix criminals and twenty-three debtors.

I visited the Rasp-house: the prisoners talk is not heavy (50 of logwood) as they have all done at three o’clock: their friends are allowed to visit them in the court three days in the week, viz. Monday, Thursday, and Friday, but must pay two stivers, as all other persons, to the keeper. The court not washed, and is offensive. One of my visits was on a Sunday morning, to attend the public service, which began in the chapel at nine o’clock. The prisoners, between 70 and 80, came decently in, and seated themselves on benches. One on the first form flood up, and called over by his lift all their names, to which each answered. The chaplain then-began the service with a short extempore prayer; he read a psalm, and most of the prisoners having books, they sung; he then prayed for a quarter of an hour, and afterwards preachedthen catechised ten of the prisoners, and expounded each of the questions to them. He again prayed, sung an hymn, and concluded with a short prayer. The service continued two hours: the prisoners, who were neat and clean, behaved with the greatest decency and attention; not even a smile or whilper did I fee amongst them. One having for a few minutes dozed, the chaplain flopped and reprimanded him; he made a very humble excuse: the keeper immediately ordered a stoppage of his tobacco; but as he was one of the catechumens who was most expert in his answers, it was made up to him. The Jews arc, very properly, excused attending. Not the least noise in the court; which I should have heard, as I fat close to the window. —I have formerly mentioned the abridgment of the term of confinement at Lady-day by the old magistrates, who examine the books, and attend to the report of the chaplain and keeper; which is a strong incentive to the decent, diligent, and proper behaviour of prison- * ers. I must again remark, that the children of these persons, as of those who are executed for capital crimes, are not left destitute vagabonds, but are brought up in the orphan-house, that they may not be inheritors of the folly and wickedness of their parents. In the new workhouse, July 13, there wrere 730 prisoners.

The Infirmary was somewhat cleaner than at my former visit, but the patients had no sheets; the other bed-rooms full of vermin: the mendicants too thinly clad, by stuff spun and wove in the house. That part called the Spbi-house is under another direction: here all was in order; prisoners at work; the notable mistress at her desk: her rooms all neat and clean, linen on the beds, and these prisoners much warmer and better clothed. This dep rtment, from many years observation and visits, seems to me the best model of a house for the correct ion and reformation of the faulty of the female sex.

The fi.ciiff was so kind as to give me the lift of the executions at Amfierdam, with the names and crimes of the fufxerers, from the beginning of the year 1780, to the

time

HOLLAND,

time I was there in 1789; by which I find only nine persons have, during that period, been executed in that populous and trading city *.

I add.

Extracts of Observations on the populousness of Amsterdam; by Dr. Houttuyn ,published in 1783.

This gentleman supposes that there are, in Amsterdam, at least 200,000 fouls; and supports his hypothesis by

the following arguments.

1. In the year 1622, the inhabitants were numbered, and found to be about 100,000; the yearly number of deaths was then, on an average, full 4,000. The yearly number of deaths is now full 8,000; consequentljr the number of inhabitants may be estimated at 200,000;

2. In the year 1768, the number of inhabited houses was nearly 30,000; and the Doctor supposes, that from that time to 1783, there was an annual increase of 50 houses, which brings the number, in 1783, to 30,750. Reckoning, therefore, 7 persons to every house, the number will be 215,250 fouls.—A^.^. Maitland,: in estimating the populousness of London, supposes 15 persons to every two houses.

3. The number of families, in the year 1747, were found to be 41,561; and, from the additional houses built since that time, he estimates the number to be increased to 46,000; reckoning these at only 4! to each family, the number of fouls will amount to 207,000; if the families be estimated at five persons each, the amount will be 230,000.

4. This calculation is further confirmed by the number of members of the several religious persuasions. Of the Dutch established church, the number of communicants is 70,000. As these are seldom received as such till sixteen years of age, the Doctor adds 35,000 for those who are younger, agreeable to Dr. Halley’s estimate, that, of the number of those actually living, 3-ioths are under 15^ years old.

OSNABURG. HANOVER.

In the Stadt-heuse at Utrecht, there were no prisoners for capital crimes. A few men for small offences were on bread and water 5 as I have seen in Germany for drunkenness, and riot; a longer or shorter term being left to the discretion of the magistrate.—I have mentioned in my former publications, that there had been no execution in the city or province the last twenty years; I have now further to addx that there has been none since my" first visit in 1776.

The prison at Osnaburgh is both the gaol and house of correction, the description of which I gave in my former publications. The floor below the ground is for capital offenders: the cells are close, dark, and offensive •, they open into strong passages. In one of these was a poor object, who was ironed hands and feet, and also chained to the wall of his cell. His wife I found in an offensive and dark cell, in an upper floor, weeping and bitterly lamenting her unhappy situation. I waited on the chief magistrate, who very readily and kindly affined me, that orders should be immediately given to soften the rigour of her confinement, and that the door of her room should be kept open into the passage. On that floor, appropriated for correction, there were eight men and seven women j they were clothed in brown and blue coats, and were employed in spinning. They are properly fed in three meals, and have one pound and a half of bread, a good bowl of greens, and a pint and a half of beer a day, all of which I found good of the fort. These rooms also were, as on my former visits, very dirty and offensive; this I mentioned to Le Baron de Borjebi he said the prisoners should, as in Holland, have the Saturdays entirely devoted to the walhing and cleaning the house j which is the more necessary as there is no court to this prison. . These prisoners attend public worship, where there is service on Sundays, one part of the day for Protestants, the other for Roman Catholics j and each chaplain has his (proper) delk, for his books and ornaments. The Jews have every indulgence, as to their labbath, diet, and clothes. I have formerly mentioned, that the mode of torture here, is more excruciating than in most other countries} and is known by the name of the Osnaburgh torture, and this has still been improved upon by a conseiller from Paderborn.

At Hanover there were no criminals for capital offences in the prison on July 2 2d. In rooms up stairs there were seven prisoners j one a very pale object. On observing several chalk marks in his room, he said they were the weeks of his confinement (42) and his process not finished. Others were not begun. This I have hinted at before; but this well-known evil still continues. I also, in my last publication, said, that the execrable practice of torturing prisoners is here used. I am sorry to say it is not abolished, but still in the power of magistrates to inflict.

In October 1781, I had the honor to wait on his royal highness the Bishop of Ofna-burgh in the castle. 1 then informed him, that his executioner had lately been brought hither to infliCt the Osnaburgh torture on a criminal. His royal highness desired fbme description of it: the cruel mode struck his highness; and I then referred him to the judge, who was presentj adding, that in this tour I had been in Sweden, where, by a

late

kte good and popular act of the king, torture was abolished, and that the door into that cellar in the prison at Stockholm was ordered to be closed and bricked up *.—I beg leave, on this subject, to copy the late king of Prussia’s order f for the abolition of the torture* who set the noble example the 3d of June 1740.

The orphan house and house of correction, which is out of the town, was in great ■order; but, on seeing the children at dinner, I could not help observing that, by their countenances, something was wrong in that house, as they had a pale and uneasy look. We afterwards found the bed-rooms dirty, the bedding scanty, and no linen to them; the children fed by the mailer, at i gro‘ and i fenZ each, The good burgomalter Alemann, the

noble founder of this inllitution, is dead since my last visit j but I am persuaded his kinf-man, Mr. Conseiller Falke, the present director, will make some alterations for the benefit of this efhblishment.

The orphan house and house of correction for the town, is an old building, and not very clean; yet, the children had a more healthy and cheerful look than those I last visited: they, I found, were better fed, and had linen on their beds. The prison part for men was empty; but the room for women, in which were io or ia, was very dirty, and intolerably offensive. In this house I saw Mr. Conseiller Falke, with the minister, and two or three other gendemen, distribute the weekly allowance to the poor, who received what was given them with thankfulness, and retired in great order: those (poor) women, who did not refuse to sweep the streets, had a small addition made to their allowance. The town is divided into seven distriCts; to each of which is appointed a relpeCtable person, to whom the poor, in case of sickness, make application, and he makes his report to a magistrate appointed for that purpose, who direCtly orders the physician of that distriCt to attend such pauper. The physician makes his report every quarter.

The hospital of St. Nicholas is an old and good institudon for freemen’s widows, wives, or daughters. Here are 16 apartments, each confiding of a small room for a kitchen, a little dining-room, and a bed-chamber. The inhabitants pay about io on entrance, and have their apartment for life, with a little garden; and gratefully enjoy some other small emoluments belonging to this cha'-'^y.

The hospital for the lick is on one large room, crowded with beds, in which are patients of both fcxes.

A new military hospital is now building, on an improper Ipot. It is too contracted, and on a bad plan, as the rooms will be only 17 feet by about 8f, and these will open into a dark passage about 6\ feet wide.

BRUNSWICK. The tower over one of the gates, which was the prison for capital offences at my former visits, is now taken down, and such prisoners are sent to the Stadt-house. Here were on the three floors, only four prisoners; their allowance two bonne grojche a day each, which is about 2 Id. In the house of correction I read the order and conformed to it again with pleasure, viz. “ That decent people may inspect the house; but no more than four at a time; that they must put a florin (about is. 6 into the box, for the prisoners whole term is expired, to assist them on passing on their journey, and prevent them from begging or stealing: lastly, nothing must be given to the keepers, or

to

BRUNSWICK. BERLIN.

to the prisoners confined for punishment.” Here were 41 men and 50 women; the employment, (pinning and weaving. The diet is in four classes and according to their work.

I observed on the slate there were only two on the first class, or the best diet, and four on the lowest, which is 1 lb. of bread, a little soup and small beer. The house was very dirty, the floors never washed, though fb many women prisoners j the only clean room was the chapel on the upper floor.—But a proper attention to cleanliness ran through all the hospitals for the sick. In that for the military, there were nine rooms, but only two patients, the troops being at Maeftricbt. Though the torture is not abolished, I had the pleasure to hear that the last instance of a person suffering it was-about eighteen years ago, and that the room had not since been opened j but by the favour of Mr. Freder/dorfft conseiller de justice, it was opened. The descent is by fifteen steps, to a dark room, in which are some of the instruments of torture: through this room Is another arched room or cellar 18 feet by 15, very black and dark: at one end is a bench for the judge, lawyer, secretary and surgeon j opposite them is a table for candles, books &c. The prisoner who fuflfers the torture, the executioner and his man, are before them. This is done about midnight, though the thickness of the walls (three feet) the four doors (which I passed), the dirt floor, and depth under ground, mult prevent the most agonizing cries from being heard any where but in that room. I saw all the remaining engines of torture, which are kept at the executioner’s house. He seemed with pleasure to Ihew the mode of application on the first, second and last question} and very readily answered any enquiries, having been several years in that occupation at Hanover; though here (he said) he had only beheaded four or five. On alking if nothing was put into the tortured person’s mouth, as I had in some places seen, he replied “ No, the Osnaburgh executioner thinks they suffer lestand on his describing some of the modes of torture (which the wit of devils and men had invented,), he said, * Sir, the Oinaburgh torture is still ruder.”

But I hasten to another country, where the torture has not been inflicted for above twice Birli.v. eighteen years, viz. BERLIN. In the court prison there were eighteen men, debtors and smugglers, and two women (pinning cotton to earn their allowance of one grofche and a half a day: the former in the upper rooms of the old prison, the latter in a new and separate part adjoining; the old dungeons being not now used. I have mentioned the punishment of smugglers Handing exposed at the gate with a machine round them, called a Spanish mantle, similar to a plate I gave of it at Copenhagen. Here also is a machine in which the hands and neck of women are fastened, called a fiddle, and they stand exposed for one hour for three (ucceflive days. This prison was quiet and in great order. In the city prison there were about ninety prisoners, many of them smugglers or debtors; several prisoners in the dungeons (11 feet 9 inches by nine) their precedes long; the whole prison dirty, never white-washed. In the court, there were men, women, and boys. The gaoler fells liquors of all forts. The allowance to debtors, paid by their creditors, is two grofche a day, about ^{d.: the criminals have if grofche.

The Maison de travail I found in the fame good order as in my former visits; in July there were 480 persons, vagrants &c. confined; their chief employment carding and spinning wool. In their diet they are in three dalles; but the very great number of men, women, and children who were at work together in one room, and in a house where a reparation might easily be made, mull in several views be improper.—In the Orphan house there were 60 boys and 60 girls; the children clean and fresh; walh three times a day; bathe every Friday; the bed-rooms clean; the boys lie Angle. The infirmary an old house, and too far from the hospital.—In La Charite or General Hospital, several rooms contain ten beds, and the patients pay a florin, about is. a week. Here are rooms for lying-in women; and apartments of two rooms for persons who pay 100 florins. In a large room, a neat table was set out for the convalescent patients, which I have often wilhed for in other hospitals. Here is no military hospital, but each regiment has one or two Tick rooms: in each were seven or eight beds. Those I visited were clean and most of them empty, which in great part is owing to the drift discipline, constant exercising and reviewing the men, and many having wives, who also have a small weekly pay, and with their husbands a room in each caferne.

In the fortress at SPANDAU there were, August 4, 1789, a hundred and seventy-one prisoners: several of them are condemned for life: one had been here thirty-two years. Their allowance is only ilb. of bread and water, and after the first year a frock and breeches, a shirt, a pair of (lockings and one pair of shoes, annually. They are to work four hours a day for the king; and when the governor employs them as carpenters or masons, he gives them two grc/cbe a day, equal to about 3I d. Many of them were spinning cotton for their own emolument at their leisure hours; but several had an iron collar round their neck, the mark of their contentions and quarrels. Their rooms under the ramparts, very close, dirty, and crowded; and as the governor (Scott, our countryman) is desirous of softening the rigour of confinement, and has fitted up two rooms for the lick,

I will here take the liberty to drop a few hints.—The prisoners should not lie on (helves over the other prisoners; but there should be only one row of barrack beds, each person to be allowed two feet four inches, with an oak partition of ten inches at the head, and fix , inches at the feet': an aperture for light and air to be made in the centre of the vaulted rooms; and twice a year, the rooms walked by die prisoners with fresh lime and boiling water; each partition to have proper bedding, that the prisoners may not, as they now do, lie in their clothes; and also to be numbered; and no prisoner to change the place allotted him, without the consent of the governor. A room to be appropriated for a work room. The court enlarged by putting the pales 40 feet back; three or four done basons for walhing their linen; and the reservoir for (baking timber, which seemed not used, would make the most proper and salutary cold bath for them. No spirituous liquors on any account to be sold to them. The rules and orders as to cleanliness, sobriety, work &c. to be signed by the governor, and read to them in the chapel the fir 11 Sunday in every

month. In the upper room 6f one of the towers there was a state prisoner: underneath there was a dreadful dungeon j a prisoner had been removed from thence the morning I was there. I have formerly mentioned, that women are not permitted to continue a night in the castle j but whilst I was walking with the governor, the mother of one of the pri-feners humbly petitioned that she might fee her fbn, which was readily granted, and a guard attended her.

The House of Correction I found in the fame neat and good order as in 1778 and 1781. Most of the prisoners were women j the chief employment now was spinning cotton and not wool i a small part of their earnings they have to buy a little tea, milk &c.

The prison is in a close part of the city; the rooms are on the two upper floors; in one Konincs-of which rooms there were seven men j and in another, eight women spinning. 1 observed, SER0* none of the men were in irons j I was told they are never tried in irons, nor are they put on, till after conviction.* In an upper room there were eleven lick women j these I understood were not prisoners, yet, if I might conjecture, sent there to perish by nastiness and i\eglect.

In the House of Correction, August 13, 1789, there were 2 men and 42 women.

Here was no reparation of the old and young, of the lesser from the greater criminals; no inducement or hope by good behaviour of shortening their term. The first view of die countenances of the prisoners, convinced me of fad neglect: no infirmary: the sick with hardly a blanket to cover them •, the men in irons. From two or three that were dying I requested the magistrates that their irons might be taken off, as the surgeon with us had no feeling for them. The sick women in three other rooms were dirty beyond description, and seemed in want of every comfort of life. The inspector and keeper, old and infirm. The magistrates, on this visit with me, were covered with vermin. I mentioned the custom in the Dutch spin-houses of devoting the whole day of Saturday to washing, and that this also introduces habits of cleanliness in the female sex. f

The old House of Correction, which was burnt down last winter, was situated near the river, and had a spacious airing ground: the two wheels or die machine for stamping dyers

• In some Roman Catholic countries, I have been informed that the priests have refused to administer the sacrament to prisoners, unless their irons were taken off.

* f In several places I now take the liberty to mention what seemed to me an obvious remedy to some defeat that happened to strike me. I hope it will not be thought by any gentleman, that I do it in the style of a djftator. Yet should it be a iked, why I did not so generally do it in my first publications, I reply, that my purpose then was to collect what was good, with a view of a reform in my own country; as I did not think any observations of so private an individual would either reach the eye of foreign magistrates, or be attended to by them: but, it has pleased God to order it otherwise; it would therefore be, on my part, refusing to do the giod offered to my endeavours, were I to abstain from such remarks as may correct abuses, and alleviate roifery in all die places I visit.

wood were not burnt. These were worked by eight men, two in each wheel, one hundred turns; and one prisoner was inspector.

Here is another house of correction, with a neat garden, and near a pleasant lake: there were about thirty prisoners in separate and clean rooms; the prisoners looked clean and healthy, which on my noticing to the keeper Gottlieb he said he had lived 37 y$ars in

Russia, and had erected a bath in his garden for bathing and sweating; and that his prisoners every Saturday in some warm room thoroughly washed and cleaned themselves. The kind attention of the magistrates, emboldened me to aik permission to copy the plan of this Ruffian bathing house j which the privy-counsellor ,readily granted.—The general hospital for the poor, sick, and insane, consists of several houses in a court. In the sick wards, I found the surgeon, who seemed sensible of the necessity of fresh air, dean-liness and a proper diet, to prolong life, and restore the health of his patients. The bread for the house was good rye bread, being well made and well baked. I mention not the closeness of the cells of the insane, as a new hospital was building for such ohjeCh of compassion.

In the Castls at MEMEL,. there were, August 17th 1789, 57 men and 11 women; mod of them were in dark and damp rooms built against the fortifications, and without bedding. Their allowance is 2 lb. of bread and water j their employment, removing the ballast that is flung out of ships. There were only 22 out at work, but at times there are so many vessels, that there is work for all the men and women. Some of the prisoners were sick, the others had a pale and languid look. If such rooms were kept clean, and feraped and lime-whited twice a year, and a little bedding were given to the prisoners, they would be more healthy, and having more light, be better enabled to gain a small trifle by their work.

At MITTAU in Courland twelve of the criminals or slaves who were in irons with a chain between each leg, as at Memel, were at work hewing and sawing timber for the palace, which was burnt last winter. I observed they were as handy and quiet as the other workmen in the court; and though I repeated- my visit to them and-was alone; none of them flopped their work, or gave the least hint of a request for money: three were sick, and as such were objects of compassion.

The prison and house. of correction (Zughthuys) is a Iquare building in the citadel: the prison part was very dirty and offensive, and little attention paid to order, the reparation of the sexes &c.; but in the Zughthuys, the prisoners had a cheerful and healthy look; the rooms Were clean. Here were seven hand mills, and fix men were grinding com: in another part fix women working on a lighter mill. The other prisoners who were not capable of such hard work were spinning. The former, work in summer from four to eleven, and from one to eight; and in winter from fix to twelve, and from one to eight in the evening; their allowance 22* of bread and some gruel made of grits which was good.

Every fortnight these prisoners use the warm bath which adjoins to the prison. About ten miles from Riga, the slaves or condemned persons, were in a prison or oftrog, similar to that I gave the plan of at Mojcovo j namely, several wooden houses, surrounded with high pales. The rooms contained about 42 persons; each had his bedstead, and most of them a little bedding. The two lick rooms were clean and not sanded, fresher and more airy than the military hospital, the beds not being crowded, and each man had his bed. In one of the other rooms they were all foreigners, (42) most of them for debt, some for so small sums as three or four rubles (eight to eleven shillings) but with some unfavourable circumstances attending the debt, so that persons are not permitted immediately to discharge' them. They are allowed from government twenty copecs (6f a day, eight of which’ are for their diet, clothes &c. and the other twelve for their creditors, till the whole debt is paid off. These were also in irons and work with the criminals at the public works. In other rooms were 345 prisoners. In a small inner room, I found two Ruffians, sent hither about four years ago: they had a guard at the door, and had never been out of the room, and are heavy ironed both hands and feet: they are never spoken to, nor is their crime known: they had suffered the punishment of the knout, (which in my former publication I have described) and-had a piece cut out of each nostril, and the mark on the cheeks, which is the signature of their condemnation for life. I saw several others thus marked for murder or other very capital crimes. All the prisoners were in irons, and’ work in dimmer from four to eleven, and from one to eight, unless lick, which the (iirgeon comes every morning to examine. There were 311 out, the day I was there, hewing timber, driving piles, wheeling and carrying the (tones for a fine mole 65 feet wide and half a mile long, on which they had been employed six years: their allowance is fix copecs a day, for which all their clothing and provision is found; the former bad, the latter very* indifferent. As to religious instruction, once a year only they go to the chapel iirthe citadel} and on the other Sundays they amuse themselves, or make shoes &c. About a fortnight before my visit, the head knout-master was brought from St. Petersburgh, who being with the other two knout-masters at a public-house, they happened to quarrel: he immediately (truck off the head of one of them j the other seeming to resent it, he dexter-oufly decapitated him also. As no crime, not even that crying one of (hedding blood, i9 punished in Rufiia with death, this man had received 270 strokes of the knout, the executioner from Mojcow being brought for that purpose j and being condemned for life, was marked as.before described. Here he met several of his former acquaintance to whom he had given the knout, and on being a(ked in how many strokes he could kill a man, he said, , if a strong man, he could in five and twenty, but if not strong, in twenty strokes..

At the Stadt-House there are rooms for the town debtors, and here were only two or three: down 25 steps are two dungeons, and here was only one person and not in irons, and he could receive, alms at a grated window} the Ruffians being very kind to such persons, as I was informed at the other prison.

RIGA. ST. PETERSBURG.

The military hospital is three miles out of town: it consists of several houses in £ large , quadrangle: at the entrance are those for the physician, surgeons, chaplains &c.: the house$ for the patients consist of four double wards, and can have no opposite windows; these wards are low, dirty, and of Tenfive, and the passages still more so, by the poisonous fcwers. The beds are crowded; tire sick lie on boards saturated with infection: the wails seemed never white-washed. These circumstances, even without attending to the improper diet of the patients, prevented any surprize when I was informed that four or five hundred recruits had died there the beginning of the year. At my visit, there were upwards of 400 sick.

St. Peters- At St. PETERSBURG I took partly the fame round of the prisons and hospitals that BURG. j ]iaJ done just eight years before. As to the former there has been little alteration} and the new house of correction, which was then nearly finished, has never been inhabited, and is going to ruin, as many of the upper floors are fallen in; so that I now shall pass over the prisons, and with pleasure mendon some of the improvements in the hospitals of this city.

The marine and military hospitals nearly join, and' make a large square with a morals in the middle; which if formed into a bason with a canal into the river , would be salutary and lightly. The rooms were all empty, and lately white-washed, except dire’, in which were venereal patients, and 36 Haves who had their irons on. All the other sick were in the summer lazaretto, which I formerly mentioned with great approbation. These are rooms made of wood in an enclosed area or garden, the size 40 feet by: mod of them have nine windows on each of the two fides, and two opposite doors at the ends, with apertures over them. These rooms have chimnies, are floored, and are about nine inches from the (sandy) ground. They are 20 feet asunder; each room contains about 42 patients, who have separate beds. The rooms were in general clean and quiet j but some much more so than others, according to the disposition of the two (women) nurses that were allotted to each room. In the centre is the bathing house. The number given me of all ' the sick at one of my visits, namely, Aug. 31, 1789, was 534.

A new and splendid hospital has been ereCted just out of the city, and opposite a fine canal: the rooms were spacious, lofty and clean, and had been lately white-washed. Tho patients were of both sexes, in separate summer lazaretts in the adjoining court; the rooms -and beds were clean and neat. Men and women prisoners come here every day; the latter to walh and clean the rooms, the former to remove what is offensive from the outside fcwers of every room.

At that great institution, the house of education for noble ladies and commoners, which I gave an account of in my publication 1784, I found the good old lady Madame Lafon jftill presiding over it.

At the foundling and inoculating hospitals, and at that noble institution tire military cadet

corps, I passed three or four mornings. In these viflts I freely spoke my mind, either in-commending what I thought right, or mentioning what I thought amiss endeavouring to-enforce my obihrvations by what was done in similar circumstances in other countries, or shewing the models of the windows &c. in our own.

I cannot leave St. Reterjburg without mentioning a pleasant hour that I spent with the good old general De Betjkoi, the enlightened and liberal head and director general of some of the greatest institutions in Rurtia.

The 9th and 10th of September 1789,1 visited thennarine hospital of CRONSTADT, which consists of several double wards, raised about four feet from the ground. The entrance is by dark and very offensive rooms: the wards are narrow, low, and ceiled with wood j and have no apertures: the floors were sanded, which yet did not hide the dirt: many of the beds are close to one another; and indeed little hopes can a patient have of recovery in such a foetid air.—Adjoining are eight summer lazaretts, which are airy and spacious wood buildings, each containing about 44 beds. These wards were sanded, which I object also to, as a harbour for vermin. The attendants on the lick are all men. Here were about 320 patients, and in the other wards 270. The third or upper floor of the new barracks is now used only pro tempore, for the sick: these were eight double wards; they were quite clean, being washed twice a week, and not sanded; the bedding clean, and did credit to the attention of our countryman the physician who presidcs over them. Here were 318 patients. Though these rooms are generally occupied by the sailors when the fleet is in the port, yet I shall take the liberty to hint, that where the ceilings are so low, there should be apertures in them, or near them in the fide walls; and the upper part of the windows should open; and great attention should be paid to prevent die offenfivenefs of the sewers. The prevalent disorders here as at Riga were the intermittent fevers, and the feurvy, widi the bloody flux. The diet within a few months has been altered, and seems directly oppolice to these disorders; the patients having now no milk, rice, barley, or sage tea, no mutton or veal broth; but beef and beef broth j rye bread, which was both badly made and baked; quas four and flat; and a vile decoction, which was brought in a. tub every morning and served to all those patients who chose it. With what concern mull a feeling mind be struck, when many objects are looking up for help and the probability of a cure is thus cut off!

' In the old prison there were 91 criminals and about 200 (laves sent here by their matters or landlords: these latter were separated from the former, but none had any beds: the rooms very dirty, and the prisoners leemed sadly neglected.

• I mentioned in my former account, that I had seen at Cnnftadt the ground marked out for a new prison which was to be creeled under the fupcrintendence of our countryman admiral Grtig; but the prisoners and the sick here, as well as many others, have reason to lament the death of this good and great man; whose fa*

, vourite maxim was, « If I cannot do what I would, I will do what I can.”

Moscow.

•1 lookedinto the hospital and prison at TWER. In the former there were only about half a dozen patients; in the latter, the men and women prisoners had their separate rooms on the first floor: there are no dungeons: the prison was very dirty, and not white-washed since I was here eight years ago, when it was just built. The prisoners subsist on bread, as much as they now chuse, and the charitable contributions from the box fixed on a pillar on the outside.

The Prison or OJirog at MOSCOW, of which I gave the plan and description in my publication in 1784, is now disused, and about four years ago its place fiipplied by a prison built of brick, with a surrounding wall; which contained at one of my visits, in September 1789, 41 :pri(bners, whose lentences were not determined; 185 criminals, 34 women, and 18 sick; in dll 278. The chapel is in the centre of the building, from which four doors open into the opposite passages, which are dark and narrow, foarcely five feet wide. On each fide are the rooms for the prisoners, with stoves and barrack-beds, but without bedding. One of the quarters is appropriated to women; another to criminals whose trials are not finished; another to petty offenders; and a fourth is used for an infirmary, and for prisoners of not the lowest rank. All the rooms have their windows towards the area and the surrounding wall, and apertures to the passages. There is a dark room for the unruly. No wine or spirits are permitted to be bought in the prison; but beer and any sort of bread.

The Infirmary consists of only one room for both sexes; but there were in it only 18 men, most of them milerable objects: several with fevers; no bedding, and litde or no attention paid them j as some of the sick declared they had had nothing all day, and it was then five in the evening. Each of the quarters has a kitchen, which seemed of little use, as the prisoners chiefly subsist on charity; there being for this purpose several tin boxes placed on the outside of the prison, and a chest between the outer and inner gates. These are opened every Saturday, and the money divided among the prisoners.

In the exercise of this charity the Ruffians are not defective, as by the looks of the prisoners they seemed not in great want of necessaries. Hence I conclude, that the nation is humane; and in travelling through a great tract of the country, the peasants appeared to me of a kind and hospitable dilposition.

New Government, or City Prison. To the court and rooms of this prison is a descent by a flight of many stone steps. There are two dirty and damp rooms, in which are confined both debtors and criminals, men and women, without any distin&ion, or any allowance. They lie on barrack-boards round the rooms, but without any bedding. The prisoners are miserable objects, who subsist on occasional charity. Such a prison is a dilgrace to any ci-yilized country. Here were about 80 prisoners; sometimes there are 150 in one of thefo rooms.

The Military Prison for defer ters, consists of two rooms, each io\ feet square. Round three fides of die room is a fhclf, where part lie: no bedding: no regular allowance: they subsist chiefly on charitable contributions. On observing to the officer who attended me, that there were some old men among them, he said that there were some who had been away twelve years.

Cfattd Duke's Hospital. This having been burned down since I was at Mofccw, I was desirous of seeing if any improvements had been made. It is built on the fame spot, as few so near the city could be better, it having a fine open plain in front. It is on one floor, elevated a few steps from the garden. The rooms are lofty, and all of them have now an aperture in the ceiling, and the upper part of the windows open, which I found in few or no other hospital in Rufus. The rooms were neat and clean: all the beds of blue linen, clean, and of a convenient size, (fix feet two, by two feet ten) not crowded, but with room on x each fide for making them. I tasted the bread, milk, and beer, and found them good j and indeed this small hospital would do credit to any country. Here were nineteen men and seven women; besides about the fame number in the venereal wards, which are detached from the house; as are also, very properly, the kitchen and offices.

At the Military Hospital I found the bread very black, and neither well made nor baked. I Ihewed it to the Doctor, and then put the question to him, « Whether or no he thought « the present alteration in the diet of the military and marine for the better?” But he was cautious, and did not choose to give me an answer. The purpose of this alteration is to fortify them, and render them able to endure hardffiips; but it should have been considered, that the prevalent disorders among those people are feurvy and putrid fevers. I had been twice over the four great wards of this hospital, before my visit to the first physician, and had found all the windows Ihut. When I went over them with him, he seemed surprized at what I told him, and ordered a proper number of windows to be opened; but, two hours after, all but one were shut again.

The Hospital for Deserters, in the midst of a. court, in which were several sick rooms, was ,

airy and frefti. The vents in the ceilings had, veiy properly, no closures. The Botanic Magazine, in the garden of the Military Hospital, had been rebuilt , upon the fame good plan. It consists of three floors, and is twenty-eight feet wide in the inside. The upper floor has ten windows, two of which are at the ends, all of the fame size, two feet and a half by fourteen inches: they have hinges, and are kept open in fine weather. The middle floor has twenty windows. The herbs are firewed on the floor in mats, or hung up on poles.

The pleasant odoriferous smell of this place induced me to repeat my visits to it.

At Catherine's and Petrowitz Hospitals, I found in the ceilings of most of the rooms, one or jnore apertures for air, but every one stopt up, and every window shut, in some of the finest ' and mildest days. Thus the Ruffians accustom themselves to warmth and close air before ,

the cold season comes on.

A new hospital for the recruits who fall sick on their march to the army, is erected about Crements-half a mile on the other fide of the river Nieper, and adjoining to it. It is a wood building Cttm*

of one floor, raised three steps from die ground. There are fix wards thirty-four feet and a half wide, having four rows of beds, about twenty-two in each row, on a barrack, separated only by a board eight or nine inches high: the walk between the rows only four feet.

Here were about four hundred sick; several very ill of the feurvy. I was informed, that at a little distance there were in the old hospital about one hundred very ill with the bloody-

flux, who were soon to be brought here. In the different wards I tailed the qtias, and examined the bread: the latter very bad: the quas four. Another drink is given to those who are word, made of honey, water, vinegar, and pepper; to which brandy is added for the convalescents. They have a fort of water-gruel, which if not eaten one day, serves for the next: no milk, rice, or sage tea is allowed: the patients are tied to a certain diet, which the phyfxcian cannot alter. The rooms were quite clean at both my visits; but the apothecary’s ihop very offensive. From one half to one third of the patients in this hospital die j for if the intermittent fever continues upon them, I was informed it loon becomes the putrid fever, and carries off the young men. A bathing-house was erecting, which, from the dirtiness of the patients, seems much wanted; and is the more necessary, as the attendants on the lick in Rujfia are men, who have neither the cleanlineis nor care of women.

Chirsok. The hospital is at the end of the town. The rooms near 24 feet wide and nine feet high. The beds are in rows against the wall; and in some rooms are one or two rows in the middle. The patients lie Angle. Bedsteads, beds, and coverlets very dirty: wards and passages never waihed, nor beds changed when the patients die. At one of my visits they brought the Doctor some of the bread and quas that was to be served out, which he " said was done every day; but .1 informed him, that neither the bread nor quas which I had seen and tailed at my former visit, were ib good as these, and convinced him, that he had been imposed upon. He acquainted me, that there was linen in the wards for towels; but on desiring to fee it, none was to be found. The lick were very dirty in their . persons and linen i the rooms close and offensive: all disorders mingled together, except those with the itch, and last stage of the flux. The attendants are men font from the regiments on account of their being useless from stupidity or drunkennels. Baths badly placed at the bottom of a steep descent from the hospital, and therefore seldom used. Here I saw spur or five half-sick women, who were sentenced here for flight offences, to waib the hospital linen. The prevalent diseases are icurvy and intermittent fever. These disorders, from the closeness and dirtineis of the wards, scanty linen and bedding, improper diet, and bad attendance, soon turn to a putrid, fever with flux, which carries off the patients in a few days. Here were a number of Swedish prisoners in the fame room with the lick Russians from the fleet. This house was the peil-house, when the plague was in the town ten or twelve years ago.. The primary objeCls in all hospitals seem here neglected, viz. cleanliness, air, diet, Jeforation, and attention. These are such efientials, that.

humanity and good policy equally demand, that no expence should be ipared to procure them. Care, in this respect, I am persuaded, would lave many more lives than the parade of medicines in the adjoining apothecary’s ihop.

I visited the rooms for the sick soldiers of the regiment quartered here. Several were brought from the great hospital, having been there several months, and not cured; and if I may judge from appearances, those whom death /pares will continue as long here j for the rooms are low, close, and offensive; many sick lie on mats upon barrack beds, with only

one blanket to cover them. I ft short, as in the great hospital, there are evident marks of. far too little attention paid to the patients.

WITOWKA (now Bokoiaulenskoe) about 40 miles from Cherfon. This place has Witowka. been fixed on for act hospital for soldiers and recruits* as not far distant from Otfchakow, and the new town of St. Nicholas. There are eight long lazaretts endofed with reeds, lituated near the river Bog, with the advantage of fine soft running water; but the country is destitute of wood for firing, as I saw not one tree for some hundreds of miles before I eame to Cherfon, nor betwixt Cherfon and this place. The first sick were sent here in September 1788. The rooms are 27 feet wide, and contain each about 230 sick, who lie in two rows on barrack bedsteads, without any partitions, and so close, that within 30 feet, I have counted *6, 17, and even 18 sick. Beds dirty. Some had an old blanket, and all a stiff black woollen blanket, which covered three or four of them. The patients were dirty in their persons and linen; and, from their appearance and my enquiries, seemed sadly neglected. On asking die apothecary to shew me his bark, he referred to his boy, who, after searching for five minutes, brought me a pot containing near an ounce, which I should not have known to be that drug *. Provisions bad. No Water for the patients to wash: no towels: the bath dirty beyond description. In short, every department of this hospital seems neglefbed and abused. When I saw so many braVe fellows, who had fought so well for their country before Otfchakow, fuffbred to perish here with filth, neglect, and vermin, how did my heart melt within me!

By a list of patients given me, it appears, that, from September 1788 to October 1789, there were admitted 11,319, discharged 7,639, dead 1,949. After my return to Cherfon, I was not surprised to find, that 30 to 40 had died in a day at Witowka.

One afternoon, oft observing about twenty poor objects standing together at the end of the town, I went to them, and found they were recruits just out of the hospital, who Were waiting for orders to go to the new town about 16 werfts distance, on the road to which is neither house nor tree for lhelter. The night was dreadfully wet, and they so weak and ill clothed, that I do not doubt but that several died on the road. A gentleman who accompanied me said, that, having occasion to go from Cherfon to Witowka last winter, he himself had counted 24 persons lying dead on the road.

. The troops were lodged in cells under ground (called Zimlankey) laid over with sticks and earth, having a hole at the top to let out the smoke. In this miserable condition do they pass the winter.

About a mile from the new town of ST. NICHOLAS, which is just begun to be built, St. Nic no-are four rooms erected for the sick, on- account of the number of recruits and prisoners LAS* of war$~^he are compelled to work hard, and have no proper accommodation, and that

the Witowka hospital was full. I found here upwards of 360, extremely crowded upon barrack beds. Many of them were very ill. The quas very brd; the bread quite black and heavy: but the patients were that morning all shifted, and most had coverlets: the rooms were swept, and the surgeons in waiting, as the time had before been fixed for our visit, the brigadier Falajef going that,day to view the works, who took with him the physician sent by prince Potemkin, and myself in his coach. I was afterwards urgent to fee the remainder of the sick, having been well informed, that there were about 500. Upon this we returned to the town, and several officers, with the above-mentioned physician, accompanied me. Here I found about 50 such objects of wretchedness as I had never before seen together. Most or all of them were recruits in the prime of life j many dying, laid- on hard coarse reeds: no linen: no coverlets: only a few remnants of their old clothes to cover them: their persons dirty beyond description: their Hurts in rags. I turned to the officers, and requested them to look on their fellow-creatures, who were thus inhumanly treated, adding, “that in none of the countries I had ever visited, had I found far u little attention paid to the military as in RuJ/ta. I knew what I said would have no other “ effect on them but to make them delpife me, but I should alTuredly relate what I had u with so much concern and indignation beheld.” These gentlemen, as I expected, soon left me. I then walked, and saw several recruits at their work, which was carrying sand on their backs to fill a mole. Many looked very sickly, and tottered under their burden. I proposed wheel-barrows, or light carts, with ahorfe or ox in each, which, as the ground was level, would expedite the work, and save the men, whose strength and spirits were broke before they got there by long marches.

Let but a contemplative mind reflect a' moment upon the condition of these poor defti-tute wretches, forced from their homes and all their dearest connections, and compare them with those one has seen chearful, clean, and happy at a wedding, or village festival; let them be viewed quitting their birth-place, with all their little wardrobe, and their pockets stored with rubles, the gifts of their relations, who never expect to fee them more j—now joining their corps in a long march of one or two thousand werfts j their money gone to the officer who condudts them, and defrauds them of the government allowance; arriving, fatigued and half naked in. a distant dreary country, and exposed immediately to military hard-ships, with harassed bodies and dejedted spirits ;—and who can wonder that so many droop and die in a short time, without any apparent illness ? The devastations I have seen made, by war among so many innocent people, and this in a country where there are such immense tracts of land unoccupied, arc shocking to human nature

On returning to CHERSON, on January 6th I went the round of all the wards of the Military Hospital and sick rooms of the regiment quartered here. As to the former, I found a great alteration with respect to cleanliness, in the persons, linen, and bedding of the sick. In the latter, some small alteration for the better in that particular, but not so general as in the Military Hospital. I am sorry to add, that in the former I saw many men’s portions of meat not two ounces, and the grits for gruel very musty. I also observed one or two of

the persons attending the sick intoxicated. One had a bottle of brandy that held two quarts, who, I fear, sells it out to the sick, which must defeat the best-concerted means for recovery. How many patients do I see in many disorders, which, I am persuaded, proceed from the life of spirituous liquors! What strict care should be taken that the attendants do not bring any to sell in the hospital! Have I not seen unmixed spirits served round to sick and dying patients, by persons intoxicated themselves; when, to my great surprize, I was told, that the physician had ordered it as a treat to the patients! If my visits had any share in promoting this, I fear I killed half a dozen of them; or, at least, put them some days sooner out of their misery.*

* Here terminates Mr. Howard’s Memorandum Book. As he died January 20th, after a fortnight’s illness, he must have been taken ill about this time; and amid such scenes of infection and disease his health and life could not be a day secure. The latter part of his memorandums not being, according to his custom, fairly recopied, has been difficult to make out, and many things just noted down in imperfect hints, could not be completed. It is somewhat remarkable, that a few pages before the end, he has written the following passage: “I am a stranger and pilgrim here; but I trust, through grace, going to a land peopled with my fathers and my kindred, and the friends of my youth. And I trust my spirit will mingle with those pious dead, and be for ever with the Lord.”
