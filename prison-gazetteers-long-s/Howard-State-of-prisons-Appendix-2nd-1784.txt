APPENDIX.

THE House of Commons having taken under consideration the regulation of prisons, I thought myself bound, by the promise made in the conclusion of my first publication, to collect such farther hints as I might be able to procure in several foreign Territories there mentioned. I therefore visited them and some other countries in 1778, 1781, and 1783, and shall subjoin those remarks which seemed most worthy of attention.

In the Draught of a Bill "to punish by Imprisonment and Hard Labour, certain Offenders; and to establish proper Places for their Reception,*" the plan was formed on the Rasp and Spin-houses in Holland. This made me more solicitous to gain the best information, by a fresh inspection, and by conversation with intelligent men. In pursuance of this design, I went to Holland in April 1778, and cheerfully entered on the intended business of my journey at

ROTTERDAM,

[Stadt-House.]

WHERE I revisited the Stadt-house prison, in which were no debtors in either of the three rooms. When there are any, they are alimented at one fixed sum, viz. sixteen stivers.† There are seven rooms for criminals or disorderly persons. One of them is called the condemned room, into which a

* This has since passed into an Act, 19th George III. Cap. LXXIV.

† A guinea 252d. is = 11 guilders 11 stivers = 231 stivers (for 20 stivers is a guilder) therefore stivers are to pence as 231/252 = 11/12 i.e. 11 stivers is equal to a shilling.

criminal is put fourteen days before his final sentence; and immediately after the sentence, he is executed with a solemnity very striking to the common people. In three of the rooms, were three persons confined for a limited time for some small offences, and kept to bread and water. Their daily allowance was from four to five stivers, and their pitcher was filled with water three times a day; but the other criminals had their pitcher filled once a day with beer, and their allowance was from nine to ten stivers. There were cases with thick straw mats, and two or three coverlets to each. — In 1781, I found here one debtor and four criminals.

[Rasp-house.]

In the Rasp-house, (or Spin-house as it is sometimes called) at one of my former visits, there were thirty-eight men, and in 1781 twenty-eight men, and forty women. The men were chopping and rasping logwood, combing, spinning and carding wool, and (a few) making fishing-nets, and forting coffee-berries. The women were spinning wool and flax, and carding hair, or winding at a great wheel, like those which at Derby are turned by water. They were clean, and appeared healthy and well. I observed the ceiling was very white: and one of the regents informed me, that the room was white-washed regularly twice a year.

The men were more separated than the women into rooms (about seventeen feet long, eleven feet broad, and ten high) each of which contained only four or five prisoners. These rooms were very offensive; the persons confined in them being taken out only once in the week. For preventing combinations, two of the men are removed every ten or fourteen days, to different companies. There were among them some Jews, whose dinner was not pork, as was that of the other prisoners, but mutton, which the society of Jews in the city sent them, with a slice of white bread, by permission of one of the five regents or inspectors.*

For the refractory, there are darkrooms, but not dungeons: in one of these, on shutting the door on myself, I found no dampness. My conductor observed, that the floor was raised to preserve it dry. Here they are allowed no bedding, and are kept to bread and water, which is given them at an aperture in the door. Their confinement is for six, eight, ten, or fourteen days.

* As I was there at one o'clock, the time of the distribution, I observed that the bread was all cut in slices: this prevents those contests or frauds which sometimes happen where prisoners mess together, and the bread is given out in one loaf, as I saw on board the hulks in the Thames, where one loaf was given to six persons.

[Rotterdam Rasp-House.]

At the whipping-post (which is in the middle of the court, in full view of the male criminals) some of our dextrous countrymen, in 1781, were disciplined, for melting their pewter spoons, and forming them into keys. The pewter was hardened with a mixture procured from an apothecary, under the pretence of its being a remedy for the tooth-ache. But the scheme was defeated by an English Jew, who for this service obtained his liberty, though he had been committed for thirty years.

The regents have a room, in which they assemble once a fortnight. Their ladies assemble in another room, to give directions concerning the work, linen, provisions, &c. They also attend by rotation at dinner, and other times; and all their accounts are carried to the regents.

The keeper has a salary from the city, of four hundred florins or guilders per annum,* and also a house, victuals and drink, firing and candle, and one seventh part of the produce of all the labour of the prisoners; so that it is his interest to see that the work be well performed: yet as the quantum is fixed by the regents, it is not in his power to be a cruel task-master. The manner of dieting the prisoners seemed to me worthy of being inserted at length in the note below.†

Being at Rotterdam on a Sunday, I was desirous of seeing whether there was such dissipation in their prisons, as there is in ours, on that day. The public

service at the Rasp-house began at half after one o'clock. The audience confided of about thirty or forty inhabitants of the town, Mr. Schumacher the presiding regent, the head-keeper and his family, and three underkeepers, besides the prisoners. The number of women prisoners was about forty, who were separated from the rest of the congregation by a wooden palisade, and seated on benches raised one above another. They were all clean and neat; had nothing distinguishing in their dress, but were without hats. While they stood up during prayer, they held up their aprons to cover their faces. The men were neat, dressed in brown coats, had been shaved, had clean shirts (which were most of them chequed), clean stockings, and wore handkerchiefs about their necks. They also were seated on raised benches, in a room out of the chapel, and separated from it by an iron grating, from the top of the room to the bottom, so wide that all the audience, except the female prisoners, had them full in view. The keeper's seat adjoins to this grating, and two of his servants, who are turnkeys, sat observing their behaviour.

The chaplain, after a short prayer, preached extempore; then, the men convicts joined in singing, most of them having books. When the chaplain had prayed again, he catechised for about three quarters of an hour. It being the women's turn that Sunday, six of them stood up, one after another, and

made the responses, which the chaplain explained to them. After this he prayed, and the service concluded by singing the fifty-first Psalm. The decent behaviour and attention of the audience, evidently proved that the service, though of two hours and an half, was not tedious or disagreeable.

During the time of catechising, the head-keeper and one of his servants went out, to inspect the empty wards, and to search whether any tools or instruments were concealed. The keeper returned to his seat in an hour. At the end of the service, the women passed by the regents seat;* and when they were gone, he went into the court to see the men go to their several wards, four or five together,† that number only being let out at a time. After they were all locked up, he went to each window, and conversed with them. Many of them returned their thanks for the abridgment of their term of confinement, as this was just before the time for electing new magistrates. One or two, who had been at sea, intreated to go in any capacity to India, as is sometimes permitted. He afterwards went to the grates of the women's wards, and conversed with them; and gave the catechumens some token of his approbation.

I cannot forbear closing this account, without mentioning the ardent wishes it inspired in me, that our prisons also, instead of echoing with profaneness

Saturday Dinner. Each man a bowl of boiled pease, with butter and vinegar sauce; boys, women, and half-tasked, have the same allowance; and all have the same allowance of rye bread and cheese as on the Fridays.

The constant supper, on week days, for all, is butter milk boiled with barley or grout till thick enough to be eaten without bread; to this, each man has one fourth of a pound of rye bread with cheese; the boys, women, and half-tasked, have only a mess of the butter milk, but no bread or cheese.

and blasphemy, might hereafter resound with the offices of religious worship; and prove, like these, the happy means of awakening many to a sense of their duty to God and man.

In 1781 I visited the few English prisoners of war in Holland, who were confined at the Admiralty at Rotterdam. A room was assigned for the officers, in which there were only two. In another room (twenty-one feet by eighteen, and fifteen feet high) there were eleven sailors, who appeared healthy and well. Several had died a little time before, which I apprehend was in part owing to their being confined in a small room called the hospital, which was dirty, without a chimney, and its sides were wood. Their allowance was eight stivers a day, a bed and coverlet and on most days they walked some hours in the court.

[Gouda.]

At La Porte, the prison at Gouda, there is a small room for debtors, which the keeper informed me had not been occupied since 1761. There are many (octagon) rooms, but all empty: some are assigned to those who are committed for small offences, and kept to bread and water, for which there is an allowance to each of them of three stivers a day. — In the Spin-house the prisoners were all employed in carding and spinning wool for stockings. On observing little towels hanging in one room, they told me, that each of them had one clean every week. Here were some prisoners from the Hague, and other towns which have no rasp-houses, who were admitted at a stipulated annual sum, of about a hundred and ten florins for each, besides fifteen for clothing. — Near this city is inclosed a triangular gallows, with an inscription over the gate.

Recte faciendo neminem timeas.

The best translation of which may be the words of Scripture,

"The righteous is bold as a lion."

[Leyden.]

In the house of correction at Leyden there were fourteen men and twenty women employed in spinning wool: the task for each was thirty-two stivers a week.

The pest-house near Leyden is similar to that at Rotterdam, but more spacious. The crew of the Barker East-Indiaman, which was wrecked on this coast, were here confined. One of the large rooms is now fitted up with beds, &c. for the reception of wounded seamen. But, very injudiciously, it has been contracted, by two partitions through its whole length.

HOLLAND. 7

[Harlem Spin-house.]

At Harlem, the Spin-house (which is the work-house or poor-house) being old, is not so airy and commodious as modern buildings. Here were about thirty male and fifteen female offenders. The latter were at work with the mother (as they call her) making and mending the linen of the house. The former were weaving coarse linen, in which, at the distance of every six inches, there was a blue stripe, to distinguish the linen of the house, and to prevent its being in any manner disposed of elsewhere. One person was working at a loom on flowered silk damask, because that had been his former trade. Taylors were also employed in the way of their profession. The room in which the women worked, and that in which they slept, were quite clean. Each bed had two persons allotted to it, and they were all allowed sheets. The poor here, as in other work-houses in Holland, appeared clean and comfortable, and were decently clad.*

[Harlem Hospital.]

In this city (as in some others) is a noble hospital airy and spacious, called the Proeveniers, in which the persons admitted are decently provided with meat, drink and lodging during their lives, and a burying-place at their decease. Persons of all ages from twenty to the most advanced period are admitted, though it is not common for any under forty to apply for admission. At entrance, each person pays a greater or smaller sum, according to his age, as by the table in the note.† A common table is provided for all

* A principal reason of the cleanliness and order of the work-houses in Holland, is the attention and humanity of the governesses: for each house has four, who take the charge of inspection, and have their names painted in their room.

who are not sick or infirm. If any, after residing some time, choose to have their victuals brought to their rooms, rather than eat in common, they must pay for that privilege according to their age, one fifth part of the um that would be required for admission at that age. For example, if a person of seventy years of age chooses to eat in his apartments, he must pay one fifth of the admission money required at the age of seventy, namely, four hundred and twenty florins.

It often happens that there are not vacant places, when persons desire admission. But many secure places before a vacancy, by paying two hundred florins in advance of their entrance money in consequence of which, their names are inscribed in a list, and the money deducted from the sum required when they enter.

Those who choose to leave the house entirely, receive, during the remainder of their lives, a certain, though very small, interest of the sum which they paid at admission.*

[Amsterdam Stadt-house.]

At Amsterdam I more than once revisited the prisons. At the Stadt-house the rooms for the debtors are on the ground-floor. In 1778 there were eighteen debtors; in June 1781, sixteen; in November, seventeen; and in June 1783, seventeen.† I often conversed with them, and found that they were all alimented alike: the first fourteen days at eleven stivers (a shilling) a day; after that time at five stivers and a half. But this is paid to the gaoler, who has great profit out of it, as appeared from the daily allowance which I weighed several times. Each debtor has from the city one quart of beer daily, and turf for firing. The rooms were clean, though the prisoners are never out of them, unless twice in a year at the times of white-washing. In 1778 there were five criminals, but their offences not being capital, all the strong rooms under ground were empty. In June and November, 1781, there were no criminals; in 1783, two petty offenders.

The walls of this prison are stone, twenty-two inches thick; most of the rooms ten feet by nine and a half, each for one prisoner only, a bedstead, &c.

* For this account I am indebted to Dr. Maclaine, the worthy minister of the English church at the Hague.

† There are two places in this country, Viane and Culenburg (not far from Utrecht) whose ancient privileges exempt them from the jurisdiction of Holland. In those places a few debtors screen themselves from arrests.

HOLLAND. 9

[Amsterdam Stadt-house.]

The door-way twenty-two inches wide; door three inches and a half thick, and plated with iron; the condemned rooms have an iron door besides. There are on the ground-floor two rooms for debtors, and twelve or thirteen for criminals, which open into passages seven feet wide; and below ground there are eight more rooms for criminals. The windows are double barred, and open into a passage in which there is a strong door between every two cells.

From a book containing the names and crimes of all who have been executed at Amsterdam, from January 1693 to the end of 1766, I find it necessary to retract the assertion "that for a hundred years past there have not been executed, communibus annis, more than one a year." From this publication, the following state of executions at different periods is drawn.

From 1693 to 1735 (43 years) - 288.

1736 - 1745 (10 years) - 20.

1746 - 1766 (21 years) - 28.

And I have been well informed, that in the eight years preceding my visit in 1783, only five criminals were executed, two of them were beheaded, one broke on the wheel, and two hanged.

An observation before escaped me, concerning the attention of the magistrates to the children, of the malefactors who are executed, and of those who are committed, for a long term, to the rasp or spin-houses. They are sent to the orphan-house, and there brought up in industry, and not left destitute vagabonds, to become unhappy victims to the wickedness and folly of their parents.

Perhaps the computation which I have mentioned of two hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants in this city may be too great;* though, if I mistake not, Mr. Karsseboom, some time since, estimated them at two hundred and forty-three thousand; and of late, many Jews banished from other countries

have made an addition to the number. But Dr. Price reckons that they hardly amount to two hundred thousand.*

[Rasp-house.]

The four regents† who manage the Rasp-house are appointed by the burgomasters, to whom they are accountable. The gaoler or is strictly obliged to obey all the orders of the high-officer, the burgomasters, and also of the regents. In no case may he, or any of his family, receive a gift from the prisoners or their friends, either before or after their enlargement. He must not entrust a servant with the keys, but must himself carefully search the convicts and their cots, or rooms, before he locks them up in the evening, at six o'clock in summer, and at four in winter. The father must never be absent for a night, without special permission. He is severely punished if any prisoner escapes. He must register in order all acts concerning commitments and discharges, and produce them to the regents when required. Also he must keep an exact register of the clothes, and all other things which belong to those confined.

The regents assemble in the house at four o'clock every Wednesday afternoon, to collect and examine the transactions of the preceding week. They appoint a servant to give any necessary assistance to the father, and particularly to cut the slices of bread for the prisoners; and when the father is ill, in the evening to visit and examine the cots.

In the nine lower rooms of this house, in June 1778, were confined upwards of forty prisoners; in June 1781, fifty-five; in November, sixty-five; June 6, 1783, fifty-one. One of these was incapable of working, his limbs being dislocated by the torture. Each of these rooms, in which they work in the day and are locked up at night, contains at least four persons. The same prisoners do not continue long together, but are removed and separated once a fortnight or oftener. Few or none of them were rasping logwood, but most of them chopping it, for the two mills belonging to the house: for it was found to be too laborious for most of the prisoners, to work with fix or eight saws, which often weigh seventy or eighty pounds. The medical gentlemen.

* See Dr. Price's Observations on Reversionary Payments, p. 186, 187. third edition.

† It may be proper to mention, that these Regents have no salaries, but only some privileges and honorary distinctions; as exemption from the city watch; liberty of free entrance after one of the city gates is shut; and a deacon's seat in the church.

[Amsterdam Rasp-house.]

who daily visit the prison, informed the magistrates that it had been the cause of frequent ruptures.*

No friends of the prisoners are permitted to visit them, without express orders from the regents, unless on Mondays: and then they must be searched, to prevent the introduction of spirituous liquors, or instruments for breaking out, or any thing else forbidden: and they must retire before the time for shutting up. Every visitant is obliged to put two stivers into a box entrusted with the father. Refreshments may be received and given to the convicts on Tuesdays; but not on other days. Every evening, at eight o'clock, the father must see that all things are in due order. The saws, and other heavy implements for their work, are taken from them in the evening, and returned in the morning. If a convict be guilty of breaking any thing considerable, of burning the logwood, or of neglect or disobedience, he is punished severely by whipping, or confined to bread and water in a dungeon under ground.

Prayers are read morning and evening, and before and after meals, by one of the best-behaved convicts: and divine service, with a sermon, is performed in the chapel by a clergyman on Sunday mornings.

Once a year, a little before the change of the regency, the high-bailiff and magistrates, with a secretary, attended by the inferior officers of justice, come to this prison, in order to contract or lengthen the terms of confinement of the convicts, according to their good or bad behaviour, as represented by the regents.

The house provides for the prisoners, diet,† clothes, shoes and stockings, with shirts of half-bleached Flemish linen. Here is no infirmary: their

labour keeps them in health; the physician, with whom I went the round at my last visit, had only two patients, and those with very slight disorders.

Some persons are confined in private rooms, to which none have access, unless in the presence of a regent. Great care is enjoined the father in conveying provisions to those prisoners. With the regents' leave, on Sunday mornings, some chapters of the Bible are read to them.*

[Spin-house.]

The Spin-house was for women. This, and the Work-house, were under the direction of six regents and four governesses: who appointed two fathers and two mothers to superintend and inspect the work, the diet,† and the lodging of the prisoners; and to chastise the disobedient.

The work-room, was a large room up stairs, separated by a wooden balustrade from the passage (six feet wide) into which spectators were admitted. This

Their drink is four pints of beer daily. But on holidays, viz. two days at Easter, Ascension-day, two at Whitsuntide, three at the fair time, and two at Christmas, they have for dinner, smoaked or salt meat or bacon, beans or pease, carrots or cabbage, and the three fair days they have strong beer.

* There are many of these rooms, or houses of confinement in Holland called Verbeterhuizen. The regulations of some of them I collected; but as they are liable to abuse, and contrary to the general notions of public justice, I cannot but wish that they were universally suppressed.

† The diet of the prisoners is as follows.

room was divided by balustrades into two, for distinguishing those who had suffered some public or corporal punishment, from the others who had not been whipped, and exposed on a scaffold.

The mother was seated at a desk (where she had a full view of her family at work) with a Bible before her. By calling there on Whitsun-Monday, I found that they kept the same holidays as at the Rasp-house.

The kitchen, the dining and lodging-rooms, were on the ground-floor. In each of the three bed-rooms were ten wooden cases, with a straw mattress, two coverlets, sheets, and one large pillow, for two persons. All were clean, and shewed the attention of the regents. In 1778, the number of criminals was forty-six; in June 1781, thirty-two; and in November, forty.

This house was supported by a small annual tax on those who sell tobacco, beer and other liquors, and one fourth part of what was received at public exhibitions and diversions.

At my visit in June 1783, the prisoners were all removed into the New Work-house.

[Work-house.]

The old Rasp-house or Work-house was worthy of observation, as a well-regulated house of industry. Here were confined beggars and vagabonds, who, for the first crime, were committed for six weeks; and for the second, three months; but for the third, their punishment was either a longer period of confinement or banishment. Drunkards also were here confined, and such as were guilty of petty larceny. In a large room, at one of my visits, I saw forty-six women carding, spinning and reeling; twelve, weaving coarse linen or sail-cloth; thirteen, making and mending linen; one employed in keeping the room clean: and the mother holding a slate before her, on which was inscribed

the names of the prisoners.* Some men and boys were in another large room, in which were many looms. But most of the men were at work in the courts, boiling and picking oakum, for calking the seams of ships. Among these men I counted forty or fifty women, and in 1781 there were twenty-five men and a hundred and twenty women all employed in the same manner,† except five or six who were mending the linen of the house.

The women's bed-room was spacious; and I found it clean and in order, though I was there before ten o'clock in the forenoon.

This house was provided with (what seems to be much wanted in the Dutch prisons in general) an infirmary. But it was too small and close for the purpose.‡

The diet of the prisoners was the same as in the Spin-house.‖ Their provisions were bought in considerable quantities. The rye for bread was on the floor in an airy room, and was sweet and good. The produce of the prisoners work was applied to the maintenance of the house, and the deficiency was made up from the Spin-house tax. The expence for each prisoner was full five stivers a day. Their number was generally from a hundred and fifty, to two hundred.

[New Work-house.]

These prisoners are removed into the new work-house or house of correction, which at my visit in June 1783, was finished. There were in it four hundred prisoners. The ingenious architect, Mr. Vander Hart, favoured me with the plan of this elegant and commodious building.

* Three fathers and three mothers were appointed to superintend this house. One father had the direction of the house keeping, and the other two overlooked the manufactory. One mother managed the kitchen, and the office of the others was to keep the prisoners cleanly, and to take care of their bedding.

† They have a quick sale for oakum; the Admiralty and India company find the old cords, and take the oakum when fit for use.

‡ The mode of keeping patients extremely warm, and preventing the free circulation of air by woollen curtains, occasions me to say so little respecting the infirmaries or hospitals in Holland.

‖ Though in this house, and the Spin-house, as well as in most of the other houses of correction in Holland, the prisoners had meat only on Sundays, yet the pease, beans, barley, &c. are always made into a kind of thick soup or pottage, which is palatable, and is served up hot at noon.

HOLLAND. 15

[Amsterdam Dol-huis.]

I frequently visited the Dol-buis, and am persuaded, it is the best constructed hospital for the insane which I have seen in Europe.

[Orphan-house.]

In the Orphan-house at Amsterdam there were about thirteen hundred children of both sexes, June 10, 1783. The rooms for the directors and the kitchen were neat and clean; but the bed-rooms were close and unhealthy, being crowded with beds, with three or four children for each bed. The infirmaries were situated on the ground-floor; and the beds in them, with two or three children in each, inclosed in boxes in the walls. For want of air, the workrooms, school-rooms and refectories were so unhealthy and offensive, that the children here (as in three other orphan-houses in this city, and in the orphan-house at Rotterdam) are indeed objects of great compassion. Many of the servants in these houses are old and indolent; the children miserably nasty, and most of them troubled with scorbutic and cutaneous disorders to a great degree. On observing this to some of the directors, they replied in words that gave me pain and excited my indignation, "It is the house disorder; all our children must have a seasoning." Thus do the physicians and governors excuse the abuse of their trust; the consequence must be, that few of the children reach manhood, and that such as do, are a feeble and sickly race.*

[Zwolle.]

In the prison at Zwolle in Overyssel there were no felons nor has there been an execution there for many years.

[Tucht-huys.]

The house of correction, Tucht-huys, erected in 1735, is a neat building situated on the ramparts. In November 1781, there were in it seventeen men and twenty-six women. There is an iron-latticed door in the front, and over it the device of a dragon chained. This and another door open into a court, on two sides of which are rooms for the men. In each of these I saw three or four prisoners, and they all slept as well as worked in their rooms.† On the other two sides are the keeper's apartments, in which are windows properly

* In many of the towns in Holland I purchased the different sorts of bread, of various bakers, not only to see if the police was strict in that necessary article, but also to compare the price with that of other places, and particularly of London. At Amsterdam, June 5, 1778, the two stiver loaf of white bread weighed exactly 1lb. — the one and half stiver loaf of best rye bread, 1lb. 10oz. — the black rye bread, a doit less than a stiver per lb. Eleven stivers being equal to a shilling, the white bread was above two-pence a pound. In 1781, bread was somewhat dearer. — By a list at the Stadt-house, June 7, 1783, white bread was 11oz. for two stivers; and black rye bread was one stiver per lb.

† See Professor Camper's alteration at Groningen, 4to. edit. p. 130.

[Zwolle.]

placed, to overlook the court. The women were on the first floor, in two separate work-rooms, spinning and knitting: nine of them, who had been branded, were working in a room by themselves, and they had also a separate lodging-room. The men were spinning; except two, who were weaving, and had their door open into the court.

As I examined this prison at the desire of Professor Camper, who thought it one of the best in Holland, I here give the plan of it.

[Utrecht.]

In the Stadt-house at Utrecht in 1778 were no debtors, and only one criminal, and his offence was not capital. In 1781, there were no debtors; but there were five criminals, two of whom were confined to bread and water. The allowance to debtors,(by their creditors) the first week, is twenty-eight stivers a day; the second week, sixteen; and every day afterwards, eight stivers.* The state allows criminals thirteen stivers a day, which are paid to the gaoler. There has not been an execution, for the city or province, in the last twenty years.

[Spin-house.]

I went over the Spin-house with Mr. Van Goens, one of the magistrates, to whose kindness I am indebted for the following account of the instructions to the keeper. In this house at a former visit I found thirty-seven men, and thirty-four women. The criminals were employed in carding and spinning wool, and knitting. The men were three in a room: the women were separated, according to their crimes. In October 1781, there were fifty men and twenty-six women. Nine women who had been publicly whipped had their work-room and bed-room separate from the rest. In June 1783, there were twenty-five men, and thirty-six women; thirty of these in one room, and six in another.

The overseer or keeper has a house for the residence of himself and his family, and an annual salary of a thousand guilders from the states, and a hundred and thirty from the city, clear of all deductions. According to the copy of instructions, he must not be absent a night out of the city, without leave from the chief officer and the regents. He must, with assistants, search every part of the cells twice a week, to see whether any thing be done, — attempted, — or introduced, that is not permitted: and he must carefully inspect all things that are conveyed to the prisoners, that no tools, or glass.

* In the Verbeterbuizen a gradation is also observed in the alimentary allowance.

[Plate: Zwolle House of Correction.]

[Plate: Gast-huys.]

HOLLAND. 17

[Utrecht Spin-house.]

no gin or other strong liquors may be concealed: and he must himself, or one of his family, be present when any persons come to see the house; and no more than six visitants are to be admitted at one time. He must see that the provisions for the prisoners be good; and take care that the manufacturer pays the same for their work, as he would if he employed others. He must confine those condemned for a long term, in strong rooms separate from the rest. He may correct moderately; but if the prisoners are refractory, and deserve severer punishment, he must inform the regents. By a particular permission from the magistrates, he may take in as boarders, persons of bad behaviour, at the desire of their parents, guardians or relations. The regents only can appoint, or discharge, a servant, or turnkey.

[Leewenberch Gast-huys.]

Leewenberch Gast-huys, in the suburbs of the city, was endowed (as appears by an inscription upon it) by a lady of that name, for a pest-house, and built in 1567. I chuse to give a plan and description of it, because I think it capable of being improved into a model for a good county hospital. There is an ascent of two steps into the vestibule, which has two folding-doors on both sides, and windows over them, and a staircase to rooms above. On the sides of an extensive passage there are four spacious wards, thirty feet high. A part of one of these has been converted into a kitchen; and in each of the other three there are twelve beds. They have galleries for opening the windows; and flues from the chimneys meet over the middle windows. Like the hospitals in Italy, there are no rooms over the wards; and this is a circumstance very favourable to the health of the patients. The floors consist of square bricks, and are supported by strong pillars and arches ten feet wide. From the rooms over the vestibule is the entrance to an open gallery (eight feet wide) over the passage, from which all the wards may be seen. By opening the opposite doors, this house may be always kept cool and fresh. It is one of the driest I ever visited. The rain-water is conducted from the roof through vaults built on the outside of the wards, to prevent them from being offensive.

[Deventer.]

At Deventer, the prison is near the river It consists of four rooms, which were all clean and fanded, but had no prisoners. When there are any, sixteen stivers a day are paid for each; which the gaoler receives, as at most other towns. Prisoners for capital offences are removed to the Stadt-house, where the same allowance is continued.

18 APPENDIX.

[Middleburg.]

The rooms in the prison at Middleburg are spacious, lofty, and clean. The three dungeons are used to force a confession; as there is no direct torture, and the criminal is not executed till the crime is confessed. The allowance to a criminal is eight stivers a day.

[House of Correction]

In the house of correction, the prisoners were employed in weaving cloth or sacking for the East India company. This is more profitable than their late employment on coarse carpeting. None were in irons. No more than four persons were in any of the men's rooms; in some there were but two. Each criminal pays three guilders at his entrance, and the same at his discharge.

[Dort.]

At Dordrecht (or Dort) the prison is in the Stadt-house. It consists of rooms up stairs, which are distinguished on the outside by strong iron bars in the windows. In this prison there are seldom any prisoners, though the jurisdiction (or bailiwick) extends through thirty villages. There was one criminal here in November 1781. I have been well informed, that for thirty or forty years there has been but one debtor here, and that he continued in confinement only fourteen days.

[Breda.]

The prison at Breda is an old tower. In 1781, there were no prisoners in it except one boy, though thirteen villages, and some of them large, are under the jurisdiction of this city. The allowance to criminals is five stivers a day. I was informed, that the torture stool in the chamber of examination has not been used for many years past.

[House of Correction.]

In the new house of correction in 1778, there were eleven men and two women prisoners; and in November 1781, fifteen men and four women. They were employed on a coarse carpeting, like the Scotch carpeting, but much cheaper. The specimen which I purchased, cost only eleven stivers, or a shilling their ell, which is two feet four inches. I here give the plan of the house taken by the builder, who has been particularly attentive to certain apartments which delicacy forbids enlarging upon, though they are of the greatest importance to the preservation of the health of prisoners. In this and other similar houses, the passages are very offensive, for the keepers will never open the windows. It would therefore be much better if the windows were wire lattice.

The old house of correction was burnt down about ten years since, and seven women perished in the flames. In the construction of the new prison,

[Plate: Tughthuys.]

HOLLAND. 19

proper precautions were taken against such an accident, by laying the beams or large joists edgeways, and arching the space with brick work, and casing the two under sides of the beams with iron plates.

[Breda House of Correction.]

I leave this country with regret, as it affords a large field for information on the important subject I have in view. I know not which to admire most, the neatness and cleanliness appearing in the prisons, the industry and regular conduct of the prisoners, or the humanity and attention of the magistrates and governors.*

Nothing can be more unreasonable than the pretences used among us to justify inattention and negligence. I cannot help taking this occasion to add the following authorities on this subject. All unprejudiced persons must acknowledge the absolute necessity of fresh air and cleanliness to preserve and promote health. To this purpose Dr. Mead writes, in his Discourse concerning Pestilential Contagion.† "Nothing approaches so near to the first original of contagion, as air pent up, loaded with damps, and corrupted with the filthiness that proceeds from animal bodies. Our common prisons afford us an instance of this, in which very few escape, what they call the gaol fever, which is always attended with a degree of malignity in proportion to the closeness and stench of the place. And it would certainly very well become the wisdom of the government, as well with regard to the health of the town, as in compassion to the prisoners, to take care, that all houses of confinement, should be kept as airy and clean, as is consistent with the use, to which they are designed." — And "as nastiness is a great source of infection, so cleanliness is the greatest preservative." — From the general practice of foreigners in building their prisons near the water, it seems, that they were convinced of the bad effects of offensive drains, and of the necessity of cleanliness; and they had no apprehensions of bad consequences arising from such a situation. Dr. Heberden has expressed his sentiments on this subject in the Medical Transactions.‡ "In England few make any doubt of the great danger attending

* I should accuse myself of ingratitude, did not I take this occasion to express my acknowledgments to Sir Joseph Yorke; who not only exerted himself with ardour to promote the success of my enquiries; but while I was confined at the Hague in consequence of an accident, favoured me with instances of kindness and friendship that I never can forget.

"wet rooms, and damp cloaths, or beds: Is this opinion founded upon experience, or is it a prejudice, which has been suffered to grow up and get strength merely for want of being examined? If we enquire into the arguments in favor of this notion, we shall hardly find any other, than the random conjectures of the sick about the cause of their illness; or than their artfully substituting this origin of it instead of some other, which they are unwilling to own. — The air from rivers and from the sea is probably more replenished with vapors, than inland countries cleared of their woods; yet the most celebrated of antient physicians recommended the bank of a running river for the situation of a house, on account of its peculiar healthiness; and many invalids are sent by the modern physicians to the sea side, only for the benefit of the sea air. "

GERMANY.

[Osnabrug.]

I went into Germany in June 1778, by Osnabrug and Hanover. The prison

at Osnabrug I should entirely omit, did I not entertain a hope, that the account of it may possibly engage the notice of an amiable Prince who is the present bishop, and so be the means of alleviating the sufferings of the miserable prisoners. The prison and the house of correction is one large building, situated in an airy part of the suburbs, near a brook. A inscription over the gate implies, that it was erected "at the public expence, in 1756, for the purposes of public justice and utility, by confining and punishing the wicked." — There are seventeen chambers for criminals, which have no light but by a small aperture over each door. I was happy to find here no more than one prisoner. He had been confined three years, and had survived the cruelty of the torture.* In another part of the house I found many miserable and sickly objects, men, women and children, almost all without shoes and stockings.

* The mode of torture here is more excruciating than in most other countries, and is known by the name of the Osnabrug torture. I doubt not but the humanity and good sense of his Royal Highness, will abolish it when he comes of age.

GERMANY. 21

[Osnabrug.]

They were spinning in different rooms, which were dirty beyond description. These rooms open into a passage, which a gentleman in office in the city, to whom I was recommended, durst not enter. I enquired of the keeper, concerning several particulars in the diet, &c. but the misery expressed in the countenances of the prisoners, made me totally disregard the information given me by words.

[Hanover.]

In the prison at Hanover, in 1778, there were two debtors, and three criminals; and in October 1781, there were twenty-nine prisoners, many of whom had been confined a year, and others six months, without being brought to trial. Some of them were women committed with their husbands, but lodged in different rooms. The allowance to all is the same, viz. two marin gros (2½d.) per day. Seven of the lower rooms are for the more atrocious criminals. At my last visit I found seven prisoners (one in each room) secured by chains on their feet fastened to the walls, and irons on their wrists, with a bar between, two feet long. The keeper is old and infirm, and the prison grows evidently dirtier as he grows older. A guard of six soldiers and an officer is stationed here day and night, who are relieved every morning at eight, and do duty alternately by taking two hours trust and four repose, so that each soldier is on guard eight out of the twenty-four hours.

I was sorry to find the execrable practice of torturing prisoners here used: it is performed in a cellar, where the horrid engine is kept. The time for it is, as in other countries, about two o'clock in the morning. A criminal suffered the Osnabrug torture twice about two years ago; the last time, at putting to him the third question, (the executioner having torn off the hair from his head, breast, &c.) he confessed, and was executed. On such occasions, a counsellor and secretary attend, with a doctor and surgeon, an executioner, and sometimes the gaoler. If the criminal faints, strong salts are here applied to him, and not vinegar as in some other places.

[House of Correction.]

The house of correction is a new building in an airy situation, appropriated to vagrants, children, and petty offenders. Here were ninety-four persons, fifty-eight of whom were children, clothed in a neat uniform of blue and white linsey-woolsey made in the house. The girls were all spinning cotton and linen. The boys, in some rooms, were carding and spinning wool and linen, and making lift shoes and carpets. In one room there were six boys (the eldest only twelve years of age) working at so many looms for saddle

[Hanover House of Correction.]

girths and clothes. In two other rooms there were a number of women employed in spinning. There are also two small rooms for harder work, such as rasping logwood and harts-horn. The coverlets of all the beds had been made in the house. The orders for regulating the hours of work, learning, recreation, &c. were hung up in the school room. Both old and young were neat and clean; and every thing in the house appeared quiet and orderly.

This institution, of only two years standing, does great honour to the founder and director Mr. Burgomaster Alemann, and is the best monument that can ever be erected for him. A good choice has been made of proper persons to preside, and inspect; which is a circumstance of the greatest importance in such houses.

Besides their own clothes, quilts, &c. the prisoners here make girths, slippers, and list carpets for sale, specimens of which I brought with me.*

[Brunswick.]

In the town-house at Brunswick there are several rooms of confinement for citizens, but they were unoccupied.

The tower, or prison for capital offences, is over one of the gates. It consists of three rooms, but none of them had been occupied for a considerable time. There had been no execution for fourteen years.

In the prison for the slaves, the barracks were without beds. They had heavy irons, and at a former visit their countenances were unhealthy. But in October 1781, they appeared healthy and clean, and were furnished with shoes, stockings, and proper clothing. The irons were fixed round their waists and shoulders, and not their legs. My visit being on Sunday, I observed that their barrows, which had all chains on the handles, were ranged on the outside of the house, ready for work the next day.

[House of Correction.]

The work-house, or house of correction, stands near the river that runs through the city. In October 1781, there were here about seventy prisoners

* The weight of the bread in this city, corresponded to the standard (or assize), viz.

lb. oz.

Fine - 1 - 10 at 2 marin gros (2½d).

Second - 4 - 4 at 2 bonne gros (3¼d).

Third - 5 - 7 ditto ditto.

Here, as in the Prussian and many other cities, there is also a standard for beef, mutton, pork, &c.

GERMANY. 23

[Brunswick House of Correction.]

who are always locked up. On the first and second floor, the men and women sleep in boxes in the passages. In the work-rooms (it being Sunday) I was much surprised to find them all (except some lunatics in chains) employed in carding and spinning. This accounted for the keeper's preventing me from seeing them at chapel, by saying no person was admitted. I was, however, admitted after the service, and concluded from the sand on the floor at the prisoners benches, that few or none had attended. My conductor insisted on carrying a pan of charcoal through the rooms; but his fumigation could not overcome the offensiveness of this dirty house.

On one of the doors, both within and without, was hung lip the following order, dated December 12, 1748.

1. That decent people may inspect the house: 2. But no more than four at a time. 3. That they must put a florin (2s. 6d.) into the box, for the prisoners whose term is expired, to assist them in passing on their journey, and prevent them from begging or stealing. 4. Nothing must be given to the keepers, or to the prisoners confined for punishment.

[Bremen.]

In 1781 I was obliged to apply to the magistrates in Bremen for permission to visit the prisons, one of the keepers having lately been confined fourteen days to bread and water, for suffering a townsman to converse with a prisoner.

[Tower.]

The gaol is a tower at one of the gates. In the lower part there are four strong rooms or cells about thirteen feet four inches, by six feet eight, and six feet high. The doors are four feet ten inches high, and five inches thick, with iron plates between the boards. The windows are only small apertures fourteen inches by nine. I found a prisoner in the same cell in which I had seen him five years before. He had made his escape but had been retaken. There had been no execution in this city for twenty-six years.

In another prison down ten steps from the street there are six rooms for criminals, without windows. One was six feet nine inches by four feet and a half, and seven feet high: another was ten feet by five and a half, and six feet high. The allowance is six sous (3¼d) a day, but there were no prisoners. In this dismal abode one had lately beat himself to death against the wall, which was stained with his blood.

[Clock-tower.]

At the Clock-tower, there are several rooms for petty offenders, whose diet is only bread and water; the allowance three sous (1¼d) a day; but their term of confinement is seldom longer than six, eight, or fourteen days.

24 APPENDIX.

[Bremen House of Correction.]

In the house of correction, the diet of the men differed from that of the women only in quantity: two men were in a mess, and three women. They have meat only on Sundays and great holidays. The keeper has a salary, and sells nothing. The prisoners descend by a trap-door into the gallery of the church, where the men and women are separated, and have wooden balustrades before them.

[Stat armen Haus.]

This church belongs to an adjoining poor-house (Stat armen haus) in which there is a number of clean rooms opening into passages seven feet wide, and large enough to hold four beds in each. The number of poor in these rooms was a hundred and eighty, about eighty of whom were knitting, spinning and sewing in a large work-room. The regulations for the conduct of the house were hung up in the refectory. The poor are here liberally accommodated in the decline of life; and their cheerful countenances cannot but give great pleasure to all that visit them. Above stairs is a neat apothecary's shop, and a room for the inspectors which opens into the church, and in which are inscribed the names of the from 1712, and of the deacons from 1698.

Not long since, this city was remarkable for the number of children begging in the streets; but a work-house has been lately established for the purpose of employing them; and here, in two rooms, I saw about a hundred and seventy from six to nine years of age, spinning (with small wheels) under proper masters and mistresses. They are allowed, at least twelve sous (6½.d) a week, and all were clean, and seemed cheerful and happy; but were not allowed either diet or lodging in the house. The benefits arising from clearing the streets of such a nuisance, have induced the inhabitants of other places, to make enquiries concerning this useful plan. The orders and regulations are hung up in the house, and consist of nineteen articles, from which I have made the following extracts.

ARTICLE.

I. The children must not come into the house without their heads combed, and their hands and face washed. For the first neglect they are reprimanded, for the second punished.

II. Parents must keep their children quite clean.

III. The children must obey their governors.

IV. They must endeavour to learn well and quick.

V. Work begins in the morning from six to eight, according to the length of the days; and in the afternoon always at one.

VI. One hour after they have begun work they are to be called over, hear prayers, and sing a hymn.

GERMANY. 25

[Bremen House of Correction.]

VII. to XIII. Direct the punishment to be inflicted for not attending regularly, and their treatment in case of sickness.

XIV. Orders the punishments for swearing, injuring others, and damaging the work.

XV. Relates to the conduct of parents who hinder their children from regular attendance, in this house or at school.

XVI. Declares the peculiar attention the magistrates will give to those parents. &c. who bring up their children in the fear of God, and in obedience to these regulations.

XVII. to XIX. Describe the rewards to children for their attention and diligence.

The contributions to defray the expence of this useful institution are voluntary; and a collection for this purpose is made from house to house, every week. No subscription is taken less than one gros per week; and the greatest subscription is thirty-six gros per week.

[Harburg.]

At Harburg, there were thirteen slaves working on the fortifications, with irons on one leg, and chains supported by girdles round their waists. Their allowance is three halfpenny worth of bread (pain d'ammunition) and five farthings a day. They are guarded by soldiers, who have orders to fire on them if they attempt to escape: but, notwithstanding this, when the Elbe was frozen over (1780) five escaped to Hamburg.

[Hamburg.]

At Hamburg, in the Bütteley, there is no court-yard, and only one day-room on the ground-floor. Above stairs, are six or eight strong rooms about ten feet square. Allowance for each prisoner is four marks a week (a mark is 3d.). Divine service is constantly performed on Sundays and Thursdays. In 1781 there were here only two criminals and one debtor. I saw them at chapel, and they seemed very attentive and much affected. The prison was clean: but I perceived by the countenance of the gaoler and his unwillingness to shew me again the torture room, that he had seen my publication.

[Work-house.]

The Work-house, or great house of correction (Wert und Tucht hause) is

designed for the reception of the poor — beggars — and petty offenders. The rooms are fifteen feet wide, and have opposite windows. The task of logwood to a strong man is 451b. per day. Some men and horses worked at a fulling mill; and a smith was in constant employment.

At my visit in 1781, the whole number in the house was about six hundred. I was happy to find a great alteration in the countenances of the inhabitants, and in the state of the house as to cleanliness. It is governed by eight directors (or regents) who must be married men. They meet every Saturday in a room

26 APPENDIX.

[Hamburg Work-house.]

appropriated to them, to examine and give orders. There is also a room for their ladies, who meet at the same time to deliver out the women's work; and too much cannot be said in praise of their care and attention.

In the chapel, the men have a room below, and the women above. An hour is spent in the service here every morning.

There are several dark rooms for the confinement of the refractory, (thirteen feet by four feet nine inches) over which are the names Ethiopia, India, London, &c. — There is a spacious and convenient kitchen, and bake-house. But the sick rooms, both for the men and women, are too small. In the room where the regents meet, are their names and arms and also the regulations which Mr. Van Hassel, one of the regents was so kind as to give me, together with a book containing an account of the institution, reprinted in 1766 from the original in 1622.

This book contains instructions for the governors — orders for the officers of the house, (such as steward, school-master, task-master, clerk, rasp-master, turnkey, and porter) — and regulations for the management of the poor, and of such as have been committed for offences. — The steward is to ring a bell every morning at five, (Sundays excepted) as a signal for the officers, the poor, &c. to rise, and prepare for prayers; he is then to deliver the keys to the turnkey — He and his wife are to distribute the meals, and see that all in the house are properly instructed as to moral and religious duties — They are required to establish and preserve good order and harmony among the other officers — The steward must not permit the poor, or the wives, children, or servants of the other officers, to converse with such as are confined for offences, or to buy or sell any thing for them — The school-master must instruct the children in religion, and encourage them, at proper times to learn and repeat portions of Scripture — he must also teach them reading, writing, and accounts; and a decent behaviour to those that visit the house — He must take care that they attend divine service, and are orderly at it; and his wife, with the wives of other officers, are required to examine the rooms in order to guard against mischief, and wicked contrivances, and the danger of fire — The task-master on Monday morning must give every person a particular task for the week, and on Saturday take an account of it — in giving their talks, attention must be paid to the trade in which they had been employed, and to their ability and skill — The task-master is not permitted to undertake any work, either by himself or his wife, for his own private advantage — his wife has the care of

[Hamburg Work-house.]

all the linen of the house — The clerk must keep an exact account of the receipts — and expenditure — of all the money — and materials — for work — provisions — and furniture — The rasp-master and the turnkey have the care of the

criminals, to conduct them to, and from, their work; to prepare their wood, and tools; and to serve them with provisions — Every Saturday the rasp-master must see, that all their rooms are swept, and thoroughly walked — he is never to go abroad without being permitted by the steward, and delivering to him the keys — he must avoid all familiarity in conversing with the criminals — The task-master, with the rasp-master, must carefully visit the bed-rooms of the prisoners two or three times every week, and examine their bedding and straw — The porter must not suffer any of the poor to go out, without leave, and obtaining a leaden stamp from the steward — he must stand before the doors of the bed-rooms of the criminals while they pass to their work-rooms in the morning, and also when they return in the evening.

The poor are not allowed to be absent all night, or to bring in company. Such as have learned to work, and appear to be reformed and industrious, are on their humble petition to be discharged.

When prisoners are brought in, they must be examined and washed, and if necessary, clothed. Every Saturday afternoon they are to be dismissed from work to clean themselves, and wash their rooms and the court; after which they are to receive clean linen.

Absence from prayers, swearing, cursing, lying and cheating, quarrelling, or seeing others quarrel and fight without giving notice to the steward or school-master, are punished by fine or forfeiture. All who commit any violence, or attempt an escape, together with those who abet or conceal them are punished by a prolongation of their term of confinement, if not in some other way. Such as refuse to work are to be punished with short allowance, or with stripes; and for a continued refusal, must be ignominiously exposed or put into the pillory. After an escape they are recommitted and punished; but for the second escape they are banished from the city and territory.

I observed, in the table of diet, that the poor are allowed no meat, except on the great festivals. At their meals they are allowed rye bread, and at breakfast, butter with it. At dinner and supper they are allowed peeled barley, oats, or buck-wheat hot, with milk (which in that city is remarkably good). The logwood-raspers, and hemp-beaters are allowed a double quantity of bread and butter.

28 APPENDIX.

[Hamburg Work-house.]

The sick are allowed a better diet consisting of white bread, beer, soup, or meat, just as ordered by the physician.

[Spin-house.]

In the Spin-house, the rooms of which are more lightsome than those of the other house, in 1781 there were fifty-two prisoners.

[Pest-house.]

The hospital for the sick (formerly the pest-house) stands in the suburbs.

The wards being crowded with beds, the cielings low, and the windows kept shut in the warmest days, it may properly now be called a pest-house.

DENMARK.

At the entrance of many towns in Denmark, a whipping-post stands conspicuous; on the top of which the figure of a man is placed with a sword by his side, and a whip in his right hand.* Gibbets and wheels are also placed on eminences, on which the bodies of malefactors are sometimes left after execution, to deter others from their crimes.

Criminals are never put into irons before their trial, unless when they are apprehended in the act of murder, or some other very atrocious crime. After condemnation, application is made to parliament, which either confirms or reverses the sentence pronounced.

Some criminals are punished by being whipped in the market-place and banished. Some of the lower sort, as watchmen, coachmen, &c. are punished by being led through the city in what is called the Spanish mantle.† This mode of punishment is particularly dreaded, and is one cause that night-robberies are never heard of in Copenhagen.

* Would not some public intimations of the punishment to follow crimes be useful also in England? Notwithstanding the numbers of fishermen and loose boys about the Hague, and Schevelin, their public walks and beautiful plantations remain uninjured; which is owing, partly to the strictness of the police, and partly to the warnings given by painted on boards, and hung up in different places, with representations of whipping, cutting off hands. &c.

† The Spanish mantle is a kind of heavy veil, something like a tub, with an aperture for the head, and irons to inclose the neck. I measured one at Berlin, one foot eight inches diameter at the top, two feet eleven at the bottom, and two feet eleven inches high. In order to convey to my readers a clearer idea of it, I have represented it in a drawing.

[Plate 7: Copenhagen. A criminal led about in a Spanish Mantle.]

DENMARK. 29

[Copenhagen.]

The place of execution is out of the city. Decollation is reckoned more honourable by the sword than by the axe. This is the common mode of execution; but of some more heinous crimes the punishment is breaking on the wheel; and in executing this on state prisoners, it has been the practice sometimes to begin with cutting off their right hands. After the sentence of a criminal is confirmed, he is allowed time to prepare for death, from eight to fourteen days, as the chaplain attending him thinks necessary. He is confined in a cell (or dungeon) at night, but is allowed to be in an upper room in the day.

Executions are rare. A great number for child-murder are condemned to work in spin-houses for life, and to be whipped annually, on the day when, and the spot, where the crime was committed. This mode of punishment is dreaded more than death, and since it has been adopted has greatly prevented the frequency of the crime. The punishment for grand-larceny has been, since 1771, whipping, and slavery for life.

[Rendsburg.]

At Rendsburg in Holstein, in the guard-room at the entrance of the prison, on a slate was a lift of seventy-seven slaves; sixty well, and seventeen sick. They are distinguished by a brown coat, with red sleeves, and irons on one leg, with a chain fastened to their waists. They work on the fortifications; in summer from five to eleven, and from one to six. Their bread was coarse and black, and seemed by the taste, to be made of buck-wheat. Besides an allowance of bread, they have a pay of one stiver (a penny) a day.* They lie on barrack beds. Their countenances were more clear and healthy than those of the common people, postillions, &c. who have opportunities of procuring spirituous liquors.

[Copenhagen.]

At Copenhagen, the State-prison is in the citadel. In this prison there are five or six rooms, about fifteen feet by fourteen, with one window, and a case or bed in each. These rooms were clean and white-washed. I observed here one prisoner, who was guarded by an officer and soldier in the room, and another at the door, though the guard-room was below. The weather being then very warm, (thermometer 77°.) he was permitted to have his window open: and this is all the fresh air allowed state-prisoners, for they are never

[Copenhagen State-Prison.]

suffered to go out of their rooms. The king makes them an ample allowance for diet. At the time of divine service, their doors are opened, and they hear it by an oblique perforation into the church, through the thick wall opposite to the doors.

I observed chains fastened to the wall in the close rooms, where the Counts Struensee and Brandt had been confined.* Here are some dark rooms for the punishment of soldiers, but no dungeons.

[Stadens arrest-hus.]

In the prison at the State-house (Stadens arrest-hus) there were nine persons confined for crimes, and eleven for debt. The female criminals were at work in their several apartments, which I observed to be clean: but the rooms of the male criminals were dirty and offensive. The allowance granted them is three marks (24 pence) a week. There are in this prison several arched damp dungeons. — A resident chaplain reads prayers to the prisoners twice every day.

[Blue-tower.]

The Blue-tower (the prison for the bailiwick and servants of the court) consists of four small rooms, on three floors. There were in it eight men and two women: their allowance is two-pence a day, with which they purchase what they please of the gaoler, who keeps a public house, and has a salary from the court. Here, as well as in the prison at the State-house, I could not but observe the neatness of the women, whose rooms were a contrast to those of the men.† The reason is, that the gaolers wives inspect the apartments of their own sex, and are more attentive than their husbands.

[Stoct-hus.]

The Stoct-hus is near the ramparts. Here criminals from the garrison, and convicts from the different classes of the people are condemned to slavery. On one side of the court belonging to this prison there are two rooms on the ground-floor, each of which, though only ten feet high, has two tiers of barrack-beds. These rooms being crowded, are unhealthy. Over them there are two close rooms for the sick; and also a chapel, which has no gallery, the cieling being very low. Here I saw a hundred and forty-three slaves, who were distinguished by a brown coat with red sleeves, and breeches

* Count Struensee having been confined above three months, when he first came out, though in view of a terrible death, he exclaimed, "O how pleasant is fresh air!"

† The reverse is common in England.

DENMARK. 31

[Copenhagen Stoct-hus.]

likewise of both colours.* Some had light chains on one leg, some heavier chains on both legs; others had iron collars. One was chained by his wrists to a wheel-barrow: and these I understood, were punishments inflicted upon those of them who had attempted to escape, &c.†

On the other side of the court and down ten steps, there are seven arched dungeons about fifteen feet by seven, with one window eighteen inches by twelve, in which were eleven prisoners, who lay on barrack-beds.

The distress and despair in the pale and sickly countenances of these slaves were shocking to humanity. My first visit was on Saturday; the next day I went to the service at the chapel, where, of the few that attended, the man chained to the wheel-barrow was one. They sat together on benches, and soldiers were properly placed at different parts of the chapel, and two, with bayonets fixed, stood at the door. Service being ended, the slaves first passed down. I then revisited their rooms, where most of them lay on barracks, dirty beyond description. At my third visit I found the prison put into better order, and swept. The offensiveness of this prison always gave me a head-ach, such as I suffered from my first visits to the prisons.

These slaves work on the fortifications, and their time for working in summer is from five to eleven, and from one to five or six. Their allowance is seven pounds of black bread every five days, besides a pay of one stiver a day in winter, and in summer, when they work more hours, a stiver and half. They were attended by a guard consisting of twenty soldiers. In returning from their work I observed, that some of them were chained to one another in pairs with loose chains; these, I found, were some of the worst, who had passed under the hands of an executioner and were branded.

[Spin-house.]

In the Spin-house there were about three or four hundred prisoners sorting, carding, and spinning wool, for the king's manufactory in this city.‡ The

* They never put off their clothes at night; and as they have new clothes only once in two years, and those very slight, I did not wonder to find many of them almost naked.

† I observed in the windows of this and two other prisons, an iron ring of about three inches diameter, on all the bars where they cross each other at right angles, to prevent their being wrenched out.

‡ The king's military cloth manufactory was built in 1760. It is four hundred and twenty-five feet long, and employs from five to six hundred persons. All the wool spun in the several

[Copenhagen Spin- house.]

rooms are spacious, but notwithstanding this they are close and offensive, the windows being kept shut. In the court I saw several small rooms, with one man in each, employed in either rasping or chopping logwood. Sixty-six women were confined for life,* and all employed in carding and spinning in one room. Separate rooms are assigned to the sick. The surgeon told me he apprehended one woman had the gaol-fever; but this probably was a mistake, for upon examining her pulse I found it strong and quick.

[Almindelige.]

In the Almindelige, or great hospital, there are near a thousand poor. The length of one of the wings is two hundred and seventy-five feet. In a passage (too narrow) six feet wide, are several rooms, in each of which about ten or twelve persons were employed, mostly in spinning worsted.† Being allowed to keep all they can earn, they purchase their own provisions according to regulations fettled by the directors.‡ There was a room or two which belonged

houses of correction in the Danish dominions is brought to this manufactory. Great quantities, especially of the finer sort, intended for clothes for the officers, are spun in the house here described.

* See page 29, line 10.

† It was a hardship on the aged and infirm, to be obliged to spin wool, when they had been long accustomed to spin flax or hemp, which is also cleaner.

‡ This being a good, though not common, mode of assisting the poor, I here give the table of diet, with the regimen for the sick, as signed by the directors, and hung up.

Regulations of the price of provisions, settled by the directors, January 1, 1781.

Sunday. Soup of pork, beef, or lamb, with carrots, cabbage, or other vegetables, according to the season: 1 pot, a skilling: 4 lods of beef, or 31b. of pork, a skilling.

N.B. A pot is about an English quart: a skilling, a halfpenny: a lod, half an ounce.

Monday. Grout made of Fehmerske grain, three quarters of a pot, a skilling. Iceland dried cod, with sauce and mustard, a skilling.

Tuesday. Pease soup, three quarters of a pot, a skilling. Beef and pork, as on Sunday.

Wednesday. Grout made of buck-wheat and water, three quarters of a pot, a skilling.

Thursday. Coleworts cut small and boiled with beef, pork, &c. one pot, a skilling.

Friday. Gray pease prepared with vinegar and flour, three quarters of a pot, a skilling.

Saturday. As on Monday.

The cook shall also keep and sell to the poor, according to the regulations, bread, beer, butter, cheese and herrings; also Danish brandy at eighteen skillings a pot, provided that no person purchase more than a skilling's worth in a day.

to a manufacturer, (a Scotch gentleman) whose office it was to give out and take in their work, and to pay for it. There being no work-rooms, the bed-rooms were crowded. The sewers are properly detached from the rest of the house, and there is a passage to them from every story, by a gallery open on the sides; which prevents the floors from being offensive. The passages of the several floors open into the galleries of the chapel, which is in the centre. The chaplain has six rooms and a kitchen. He officiates on Sundays, and has a salary of three hundred dollars a year, (Danish dollar 3s. 9d.) besides some perquisites, but he has no other charge to attend. A clerk officiates at eight, every morning, and is allowed two dollars a week.

[Frederick's Hospital.]

Frederick's hospital, or the royal infirmary, is an elegant building, and has a spacious area with pleasant walks for the patients. Many of the poor citizens are admitted and maintained gratis: others, on paying seven marks (nine-pence) a week, or if they have separate rooms, fourteen. Thirty soldiers may also be admitted, who, if single, are obliged to give up their whole pay to the hospital, and if married, half. The patients wear the clothes of the house. Each of them has a bed to himself; and their number was one hundred and forty-two men and eighty-five women. Of these, one hundred and fifty-eight were under the care of the physician, and sixty-nine under the surgeon. Here, a proper separation is made between these two sorts of patients. The wards are not crowded; and it is the custom to white-wash them once every year. If this were universally practised in their hospitals and prisons, it would have a very beneficial effect.

Regimen for the Sick.

Sunday Dinner. Beef, mutton or lamb soup, with roots or greens, and four lods of meat, or instead of meat, wheaten bread and butter.

Monday. Grout of Fehmerske grain, with butter and sweet milk.

[Marine Hospital.]

The Marine Hospital contained one hundred and fifty-seven patients, separated from one another according to their different disorders. Their diet and regimen are the same as in Frederick's hospital. Their beds have no curtains; and in fine weather are carried out to be beat and aired. The wards are spacious, and care is taken to keep them cleanly, by sweeping them twice every day, and washing them once every week.

[Orphan-house.]

In the Hospital for the education of poor children, there were two hundred and twenty-five boys; almost all of whom had cutaneous disorders and sickly countenances. I found no proper management here, and the rooms were close and dirty. When the director shewed me the sick rooms, I told him, all the rooms were sick rooms.

[St. John's Hospital.]

In St. John's Hospital, which is the pest-house, and stands half a mile from the city, there were about a hundred men and two hundred women. In each of two of the wards there were ten or twelve small rooms for the insane. Though the weather was warm, the windows were shut; a circumstance peculiarly bad for that sort of patients. The chaplain, who resides here in a neat house, favoured me with his company through some of the wards. The rest I visited with one of our countrymen, who had almost forgot his mother tongue. The windows, though opposite to one another, were of little use except for light. The house was clean; the floors sanded: and the beds neat.*

* At Copenhagen in the beginning of July 1781, I bought four sorts of bread; of the finest I had 7 ounces for a Danish stiver (equal to 1 penny English); of the second sort, 10 ounces; of the third fort, 20 ounces; of the fourth, exactly two pounds.

36 APPENDIX.

SWEDEN.

In travelling through the country in Sweden, I observed the houses to be

much cleaner than those in Denmark; and this led me to hope I should find the same difference in the prisons; especially as I was told they were visited every Saturday by an officer from the chancery. But I was disappointed, for I found them as dirty and offensive as those in Denmark. Some of the prisons at Stockholm are near the water; the city, which stands on seven islands, being well adapted for that situation. When I attended at the trials in the court of justice in July, the want of fresh air, in consequence of the windows being shut, affected me so much as to make me ill a considerable time afterwards.

[Stockholm.]

There are three prisons at Stockholm; one in the northern suburbs, one in the southern, and the other in the city itself. Criminals while confined in these prisons are not in irons. If the offence be capital, they are after condemnation sent to the great prison (called Smed-garden); from whence they may appeal to parliament, which must confirm the sentence before it can be executed.

The general mode of execution is by the axe. Women are beheaded on a scaffold, which is afterwards set on fire at the four corners, and consumed with the body. The present king has humanely abolished all torture, and ordered a dark cellar applied to this purpose in the great prison, to be bricked up.*

I was present four or five hours in one of the courts of justice, when many civil and criminal causes were tried. The burgomaster (with his gold chain) was seated at one end of a table, and on each side four or five other magistrates. The manner of swearing a witness was by requiring him to put two fingers on a Bible and to pronounce the words of the oath deliberately after the burgomaster. — In some causes only one witness was sworn; in others, several; and

* The gaoler told me that agreeably to the king's order, the door-way had been bricked up. On my infisting, to see the wall that I might be assured of the fact, I found the cellar still open.

SWEDEN. 37

[Stockholm.]

while one was under examination, the rest were not allowed to be present, except in trials for petty offences, when no oath was administered. — In civil causes, both plaintiffs and defendants presented memorials, and some were allowed counsel. — In a prosecution of a man for beating his wife, I observed that one of the senior magistrates pleaded the wife's cause, and then withdrew with the parties concerned in the prosecution. The judge, having consulted a book of laws, called them in again; and after hearing the law read and the sentence pronounced, they bowed and departed at different doors. I observed in petty disputes, a reconciliation so hearty sometimes taking place, that the contending parties shook hands, and went off together shedding tears of joy.

[Norr Kiamnars Ratt.]

In the prison called Norr Kiamnars Ratt for the northern suburbs (which are four times as large as the city itself), there are two justice-rooms and six other rooms. It had in it only three prisoners. The allowance, six stivers per day.

[Soder Kiamnars Ratt.]

In the prison for the southern district Soder Kiamnars Ratt, there were also six rooms; four of which, having their windows nailed up, were very dark, dirty and offensive. Here were five prisoners almost stifled, in consequence of receiving no air except through a small aperture in the door of each room. The other two rooms were light and airy, and are sometimes used as an infirmary.

The gaoler here, as in the other prisons, sells liquors. His room, like those I have too often seen in my own country, was full of idle people who were drinking.

[Stads Kiamnars Ratt.]

In the prison for the city, called Stads Kiamnars Ratt, the rooms were very dirty, and the windows of all, except one, were shut. The countenances of the prisoners bespoke neglect and oppression. Here were two rooms appropriated to criminals condemned for a certain term, to bread and water. In one of these rooms there were two persons, who seemed almost starved, being allowed only six stivers worth of bread, (2d) per day, and that sold them by an unfeeling gaoler.*

* Seeing these miserable objects thankful for a small donation of bread, I said to the goaler, "a sentence for twenty-eight days must be very severe." He replied, "it is good for their health." I can make a good conjecture of the state of a prison, from the countenances of the prisoners: complacency and submission appear under kind treatment, even though the apartments be bad, and the allowance scanty.

38 APPENDIX.

[Stockholm.]

There is here no chapel; nor are the prisoners ever allowed to leave their noxious cells. I observed coffins are kept ready for the dead.

[Smed-garden.]

The Smed-garden (to which criminals are sent after condemnation) is a brick garden. building in an airy situation. It has a court inclosed with high planks (or palisades). In one of the rooms on one side of this court, I saw two barrack beds and three men loaded with irons. Their allowance is six stivers day, with which they may purchase what they please. Two worth of bread weighed exactly twelve ounces.

On the other side of the court is the chapel, and the apartments of the women, where I saw five prisoners at needle-work, but none in irons; and, I was informed, the women are never put into irons.

There was a bed in the chapel, where the convict rests till his execution, which is sometimes three weeks: two days before this, his irons are taken off.

The men are allowed to walk in the court from eight to nine, and from four to five: the women are allowed the same privilege, but at different times.

[Debtors-prison.]

The prison for debtors is in the city, and consists of two rooms on the first floor and two over them. Here were sixteen men, and one woman. The rooms being all open, they associate with one another as they please.* The allowance to each is six stivers a day paid by their creditors: on default of payment they are released.

This prison being in a close part of the city, is one of the most unhealthy. But, I was informed, it is to be removed to a more airy situation in the southern suburbs.

[Spin-house.]

The Spin or Rasp-house has an inscription over the door, Stockholms Stad Spin och Rasp hus. An. 1750. It Hands on a declivity, at the extremity of the suburbs, and near a lake.

The number of prisoners was a hundred and eighty; twenty or twenty-five of whom I saw in a room, sorting, carding, or spinning wool; every prisoner is obliged to spin two pounds and a half (equal to about three thousand ells)

* One advantage which arises from the separation of prisoners is, that it prevents taking garnish: this, though a constant practice here, is not common in foreign prisons.

SWEDEN. 39

[Stockholm Spin-house.]

of yarn in a day: all that is done by any prisoners more than this, they are paid for, at the rate of two stivers a pound; and, as a farther reward, they become entitled to an abridgment of their term of confinement in proportion to their diligence.

The women's apartments were clean; but the countenances of the men and boys were sickly, and their rooms dirty and offensive. The men were not separated from the boys as they should have been, nor the women from the girls.

The rooms employed as an infirmary were clean, and strewed with the young shoots of the spruce fir: it had in it five sick women, and five or six convalescents.

On inquiry, I found the scurvy was a prevailing disorder here, especially in August; which, I doubt not, is owing to close confinement, to the want of cleanliness, and to the use of salt-fish and other salt provisions. Some precautions are used against this disorder, for the prisoners at their admission are examined by the surgeons; after which they are required to bathe themselves, and to continue this as a practice twice a month.

They attend prayers in the hall of the Spin-house every day; in summer, at six in the morning and seven in the evening; and in winter, at eight and four.

A person in the office of an inspector has a convenient house here, with a salary of 50l. per Annum, which is large for this country, and four times more than the salary of the keeper. I am persuaded of the impropriety of trusting such establishments to the care of interested men.* Neither the condition of the wards, nor the appearance of the prisoners, did this inspector any credit.

[Hospital.]

I visited several charitable institutions in this city, but I will mention only the hospital for the sick. There were in it thirty-two patients. In the largest of the rooms there were only seven beds: a distinct bed was allotted to each patient, and all was clean and neat. Two of the rooms were appropriated to venereal patients. The floors, as in the other hospitals and in most of the private houses were strewed with the young shoots either of the spruce fir or juniper tree. Having asked the reason, one of the surgeons told me, "it was done to prevent infection." I attended Mr. Akren, the principal surgeon

through the wards, and saw him dress the patients. Three or four pupils assisted, and four other attendants; one of whom was a woman carrying a bason of water.*

RUSSIA.

In Russia the peasants and servants are bondmen or slaves, and their lords (or masters) may inflict on them any corporal punishment; or banish them to Siberia on giving notice of their offence to the police. But they are not permitted to put them to death. Should they, however, die by the severity of their punishment, the penalty of the law is easily evaded.†

Debtors in this country are often employed as slaves by government, and allowed twelve roubles‡ yearly wages, which goes towards discharging the debt.‖ In some cases of private debts, if any person will give sufficient security to pay twelve roubles a year, as long as the slave lives, or till the debt is paid off; as also to produce the slave when he is demanded; such person may take him out of confinement: but if he fails to produce him when demanded, is liable to pay the whole debt immediately.

* The several sorts of bread in Stockholm were exactly according to the assize:

The fine white, 1lb. }

Second sort, 1lb. 9; oz. } for a pence English

The coarsest, near 4lb. }

† Instances, however, of great attachment of peasants to their lords, in consequence of good, treatment, are not uncommon. A gentleman was shewn me at whose peasants, hearing of his intention to sell his estate, brought him all the money they had saved, and gave it him, upon condition that he should keep his land, and still continue to be their master.

‡ One hundred copecks is a rouble, and a rouble about four shillings.

|| An impracticable scheme has been advanced by a late author to oblige debtors in England to work off their debts by their own labour. The Marquis in his former editions of his Essay on Crimes and Punishments, had proposed some such scheme; but in the third edition he acknowledged his mistake, and confessed that he had injured the rights of humanity, and was ashamed that he had adopted so cruel an opinion.

[Plate.]

RUSSIA. 41

[Russia.]

There are no regular gaolers appointed in Russia, but all the prisons are guarded by the military. Little or no attention is paid to the reformation of prisoners.*

There is no capital punishment for any crime but treason: but the common punishment of the knoot is often dreaded more than death, and sometimes a criminal has endeavoured to bribe the executioner to kill him. This punishment seldom causes immediate death, but death is often the consequence of it.

[Petersburg.]

The governor of the police at Petersburg was so kind as to fix a time for shewing me all the instruments commonly used for punishment — the axe and block — the machine (now out of use) for breaking the arms and legs — the instrument for slitting or lacerating the nostrils — and that for marking criminals, (which is done by punctuation, and then rubbing a black powder on the wounds) — the knoot whip — and another called the cat, which consists of a number of thongs from two to ten.

[Knoot.]

The knoot whip, is fixed to a wooden handle a foot long, and consists of several thongs about two feet in length twisted together, to the end of which is fastened a single tough thong of a foot and half, tapering towards a point, and capable of being changed by the executioner, when too much softened by the blood of the criminal.

August 10, 1781, I saw two criminals, a man and a woman, suffer the punishment of the knoot. They were conducted from prison by about fifteen hussars and ten soldiers. When they arrived at the place of punishment, the hussars formed themselves into a ring round the whipping-post, the drum beat a minute or two, and then some prayers were read, the populace taking off their hats. The woman was taken first; and after being roughly stript to the waist, her hands and feet were bound with cords to a post made for the purpose, a man standing before the post, and holding the cords to keep them tight. A

* In the instructions for a new code of laws by the present Empress, however, a very just and humane distinction is made between prisoners of different classes. "One ought not to confine in the same place, 1. an accused person, against whom there are only appearances, 2. a convict, 3. a criminal who is condemned to prison as a punishment. The accused person is only detained; the two others are imprisoned: but with respect to the former of them, the prison is only a part of punishment; with respect to the latter, it is the punishment itself."

servant attended the executioner, and both were stout men. The servant first marked his ground and struck the woman five times on the back. Every stroke seemed to penetrate deep into her flesh. But his master thinking him too gentle, pushed him aside, took his place, and gave all the remaining strokes himself, which were evidently more severe. The woman received twenty-five, and the man sixty: I pressed through the hussars, and counted the number as they were chalked on a board; and both seemed but just alive, especially the man, who yet had strength enough to receive a small donation with some signs of gratitude. They were conducted back to prison in a little waggon. I saw the woman in a very weak condition some days after, but could not find the man any more.

[Fortress.]

In the Fortress there are many vaulted rooms, some of which are now used for the confinement of deserters, and criminals of various sorts, who work on the fortifications. Some were glad of the privilege of being employed in the governor's garden, for the sake of the flour which he gave them for their labour. Others, with logs to their legs, were drawing wood out of the Neva. Thirty-five were crowded into one of the rooms, which therefore was excessively hot, having only two small apertures (ten inches by nine) for the admission of air. In another part of this building, seventy-five slaves with logs fastened to both their legs, were lodged in four rooms, which were still more close and offensive. In a few rooms (used as barracks,) some officers were confined. Every room was furnished with an oven or stove, and most of them with barrack-beds.

[Police Prison.]

In the Police prison there were in one room nine women, and in two other rooms forty-four men. In two small and low arched cellars (very hot and offensive,) I saw fifteen men, most of them in irons. In a room called the infirmary, detached from the rest of the prison, there were seven persons sick. All the prisoners subsist on voluntary contributions, collected in boxes before their grates, and at church. This is all the advantage they derive from the church near the prison, for they are never permitted to enter it, or to go out of their rooms; except on particular occasions with guards of soldiers.

[New Government Prison.]

In the New government prison behind the courts of justice, there are barracks for the guard near the rooms of confinement. The number of prisoners was

RUSSIA. 43

[Petersburg.]

sixty-eight, including two confined for debt, and twenty-seven male and female vagrants and petty offenders, all crowded together into one little room.

[Prison.]

In the suburbs is a prison, consisting of several timber houses, surrounded with high palisades. In one house I saw twenty-five prisoners, in another five or six, all with irons on both legs. Some were out at work, and the whole number was near eighty. Many were boys of twelve or fifteen years of age. In the middle there was a kitchen, in which there was an oven and many loaves of bread for the prisoners, like that for the soldiers. They seemed under close confinement, though there is a large court in which they might be allowed to walk with safety.

[Debtors Prison.]

The prison for debtors consists of four vaulted rooms communicating with one another, and furnished with stoves and barrack-beds. The prisoners are never permitted to go out of their rooms. They subsist by alms received from passengers in little boxes placed before the windows; but government supplies them with wood for fuel. One told me, he had been confined for five years, for a debt of fifteen roubles; and another, four years for twenty-five roubles.

[Spin-house.]

A Spin-house (or house of correction) is building in this city, situated near the river. It is an elegant, though plain building, with fifty-seven windows in front, and two galleries at the back-front supported by pillars. There is an ascent of a few steps to the first floor; all the staircases are stone (five feet wide); the rooms are about thirty-three feet by twenty-three; the windows six feet from the floor; the cielings are lofty, in the middle of which are apertures fourteen inches square; and the roof consists of thin iron plate.

I visited several hospitals in this city with pleasure, the rooms, even of the insane, being as clean as those in Holland: but I shall mention only two or three.

[Military Hospital.]

The hospital for soldiers, and the marine hospital, form a great quadrangle, built chiefly of brick in a morass near the Neva. The Military hospital consists of twenty-eight spacious rooms, besides two or three anatomical rooms in which lectures are read. There is a chapel in the centre, but it is in a ruinous state, having been left unfinished, because the builder had hanged himself in it.

44 APPENDIX.

[Petersburg Military Hospital.]

At a little distance in a large area or field inclosed with wooden palisades, there are fourteen or fifteen houses constructed of wood, about eighty feet by twenty-one; in each of which there are forty or forty-five beds or cradles, admitting one patient only. The centre house has fourteen small rooms opening into a close passage, and very offensive.

[Marine Hospital.]

The Admiralty or Marine hospital has two floors. The rooms open into a gallery under arcades, and are clean and airy, having windows opposite to one another, and on one side looking towards the Neva. Four of these rooms were occupied, and in one of them there were forty beds, each admitting only one patient.

At the back of this hospital, in an area or garden inclosed by palisades, is a row of seven summer rooms for convalescents, each a separate building, seventy feet by twenty-six. They were clean and sweet, and strewed with the young shoots of the spruce fir.

In the centre building there are rooms for warming water for bathing; as there were also in the military hospital. Bathing is the constant practice of the Russians.

This provision of summer rooms is a wise expedient peculiar to Russia, and deserves the highest commendation. By the constant succession of patients the walls of other hospitals are contaminated; but in Russia, by lodging patients in these summer rooms, the hospitals are left to be freshened and purified.

[Convent.]

On a rising ground at a little distance from Petersburg, and on the south side of the river Neva, there is a stately pile of buildings, originally designed for a Convent, but ever since 1764 converted by the Empress Catharine the Second, into a public establishment for educating the female nobility of Russia, and a limited number of the children of commoners. The sleeping rooms and dining-halls in these buildings are remarkably lofty and airy, having large galleries round them; and adjoining to the buildings there are spacious gardens and lawns, which extend to the banks of the river. — The number of the children of nobility on this establishment is two hundred; and the number of the children of commoners or peasants was, till 1770, limited to two hundred and forty: but since this year it has been increased to two hundred and eighty, by a fund provided by the munificence of general De Betskoi, the enlightened and liberal head and director-general of this, and all the other institutions of the same kind established by her imperial majesty. The

[Plate 9.]

RUSSIA. 45

[Petersburg Convent.]

The principal regulations for conducting this institution are the following. — The children are admitted between five and six years of age, and continued on the establishment twelve years. They are divided into classes according to their ages, four of nobles with fifty in each class, and four of commoners with seventy in each class. — In every third year on the 21st of April, (the birth-day of the Empress,) fifty children of the nobility, and seventy of commoners are taken in, to replace the same numbers discharged. — Before they rise every morning, the windows of their rooms are thrown open to purify them with fresh air. — The first class (dressed in brown, and consisting of children of the youngest ages,) rise at seven in winter, and at six in summer. — After being washed and attending prayers, they are taken into the garden where they breakfast, and play about in the coldest weather till nine. During their first year, each of them is allowed for breakfast, a small loaf of white bread, and a glass of milk and water; but after their first year, they are allowed no other drink than water. — At nine they are called back to the house, and from this hour to eleven are employed in learning the French and Russian languages, and in knitting, sewing &c. but care is taken to render all the instruction they receive agreeable, nothing being taught in this establishment by compulsion. — Twice in the week they receive lessons in dancing; and this is a part of education common to all the classes, and never discontinued, because reckoned conducive to health. — After eleven they return to their play in the garden, where they continue till noon, at which time they are called to dinner, which consists of soup, vegetables &c. For some months at first they are allowed meat; but they are gradually weaned from it, till at last, while in this and the next class, it comes to be entirely withheld from them (except in soups,) in order to cure them of some cutaneous distempers to which at this age they are subject, and also to prepare them for passing with less danger through the hooping-cough, measles and small-pox. After dinner they return to the garden, and at four, have a repast similar to that in the morning, viz. a loaf of bread and a glass of water. Here they continue to divert themselves till at seven they are called to supper, which consists in winter of dried fruit, milk and grain; and in summer of preparations of milk, and some provisions from the garden. — It may be proper to add, that they read and write standing, and are not allowed to sit down, except to needle-work. — In consequence of this management, and of living so much in the air, and being used to exercise, and cleanliness and a simple diet, they are seldom known to take cold; and

46 APPENDIX.

[Petersburg Convent.]

become capable of bearing the severest weather of the climate without receiving any harm, their clothing being only a short wadded cloak, whilst others are loaded with furs.

The second class (dressed in blue) enter it about eight years of age, and are obliged to apply more closely to writing, drawing, dancing &c.

The third class (dressed in grey) enter it at eleven or twelve years of age. They rise at five, in the summer, and six, in winter; but are called to the house (after breakfasting in the garden,) an hour sooner than the children in the first and second classes; because more time is wanted for instructing and improving them. They are now taught (besides drawing, dancing, turning,* needle-work &c.) vocal and instrumental music. They are allowed a ball and concert every week; and a taste for books is inspired, by putting them upon copying and reciting select s from the best authors.

The fourth class (dressed in white) enter it at fourteen or fifteen years of age. They are taught tambour-work, house-keeping, the management of a family &c. and initiated into history, geography and natural philosophy. In order to acquire a just elocution, and to exercise themselves in politeness, and vocal and instrumental music, they occasionally give balls and little operas to company from Petersburg.

The children of the nobility and of commoners are distinguished from one another, only by wearing a finer camlet of the colours appropriated to the different classes and as far as diet, exercise, regimen &c. are concerned, the method of managing them is the same; but the instruction given the latter, is confined to needle-work, reading, house-keeping and such other occupations and improvements as are suitable to the humbler walks of life, for which they are intended.

The children on this foundation enjoy, as might be expected, an uncommon degree of health. — Of fifty-one children of nobility admitted in 1764, and fifty admitted in 1767, and fifty-two in 1770, none had died in 1781; and of fifty admitted at different times, by the particular order of the between 1764 and 1780, only two had died in 1781. — Of sixty children also of commoners admitted in 1767, and seventy in 1770, only seven had died in 1781. But of sixty admitted in 1764, thirteen had died; in consequence, it

* I was obliged to the ladies for a very curious piece of their work in ivory, which was presented to me on my visit to this house.

[Petersburg Convent.]

is supposed, of having been lodged in a part of the buildings which had been just erected, and therefore was not sufficiently dry. — This account I owe to the obliging information of Dr. Guthrie, physician to a military cadet corps of nobles, established at Petersburg by the Empress, and supposed the grandest institution of the kind in the world.

[Cronstadt.]

At Cronstadt (or Crownstade) the principal station for shipping, the slaves were lodged in several rooms, inclosed by palisades, and guarded by an officer with a hundred soldiers, who attend them while at work. In the rooms, there were only two, who were sick: the rest were removing the ballast flung out of the ships. They had healthy countenances, and were robust and strong, though their diet seemed scanty. — The following is their allowance from government: to each for diet, 72½ pounds of rye flour, (about 65 pounds*) 7½ pounds of barley or buck-wheat, and two pounds of salt, every month. — For clothing, a sheep-skin pelisse; coarse cloth coat, waistcoat and breeches; woollen hat and fur cap, and a pair of drawers every two years; and every year, sixteen arshins (about 12½ yards) of coarse linen for shirts and thin drawers; three pair of stockings, three pair of shoes, two pair of fur gloves, and a pair of sheep-skin cangees.† Fuel also is allowed by government.

The number of slaves, malefactors and debtors is in general about two hundred, but in November 1781, their number was only one hundred and fifty-one, viz. slaves indebted to government and malefactors, thirty-four; debtors, and peasants sent by their lords for crimes and misdemeanors on their estates, one hundred and seventeen.

I will say nothing of the prison here, because I saw the ground marked out for a new one, which is to be erected under the superintendence of our attentive and judicious countryman Admiral Greig.

* The French prisoners in England have been desirous of having their allowance in flour, that they might make their own bread, as the Russian slaves do, who also, both here and at the fortress, make for themselves a fermented liquor called quass, two barrels of which I saw in the rooms.

† The expence for every slave is twelve roubles a year; namely, for diet, eight roubles and fifty-two copecks; for clothes, three roubles and forty-eight copecks. I owe this account to the kindness of Admiral Greig.

48 APPENDIX.

[Cronstadt Hospital.]

In the hospital at Cronstadt, built by Peter the Great, and intended by him for a palace, there were many spacious rooms, all perfectly clean, with eight or ten beds in every room, each bed admitting one patient only. Two hundred and seventeen of the patients were sailors; and on their beds were marked the names of the ships to which they belonged. Books were hung up at the doors of the rooms, containing an account of the numbers of the beds, the prescriptions, diet &c.

At a little distance from this building, there are seven rooms for convalescents and scorbutic patients, seventy-two feet in length and twenty-three in breadth. Four of them were occupied, one of which had in it fifty-five beds, and the rest almost as many. The kitchen and bake-house were separate buildings; and the bread appeared to be wholesome and good. There was here also a room for the hot, or vapour baths, which are common in Russia, and which undoubtedly conduce greatly to the health, as well as the cleanliness of the inhabitants.

August 22, 1781, the number of patients in this hospital was five hundred and fifteen. Those attended by surgeons were separated from the rest, and the appearance of all of them shewed plain proofs of the care and attention paid them. An officer visits the hospital every day, and makes a report to the admiral.

[Wyschnei Wolotschok.]

At Wyschnei Wolotschok the prison is in the suburbs, constructed of wood, and inclosed with palisades of thick planks. Here were sixteen prisoners employed on the public works, all but one, in irons; two were loaded with irons on their legs, and chained together by the neck.

[Tver.]

In the prison at Tver there were twenty-six prisoners. The rooms were so offensive, that a medical gentleman did not chuse to look into more than one of them. It is a new prison, but I hope not a model for others, as has been reported. The prisoners in it, and likewise in the prison last mentioned, subsist on charitable contributions.

[Moscow Prison.]

The great prison or Ostrog at Moscow is in the suburbs.* In the first room of a brick building there are four wooden cages, in which were two men

* I am obliged to Mr. Dickinson for a drawing of this prison, and of the botanic magazine.

RUSSIA. 49

[Moscow Prison.]

chained by the neck to the wall, with irons on their legs. At the sides of this room there were several rooms for the examination and punishment of criminals.

At the back of this building is a court sixty feet wide, with a guard-house in it and six rooms for confinement.

The main prison, on the outside, is two hundred and eighty feet by two hundred and forty-four. It is inclosed with strong pieces of timber sixteen or eighteen feet high. The entrance from the court just mentioned leads into a walk (twenty-four feet wide,) on one side of which there are three other courts, and four on the opposite side of different dimensions. In these courts there are a number of wooden houses consisting of one, two or three rooms; every room having barrack-bedsteads or shelves in it, and an iron latticed door, with another of wood. In two of the courts there are small rooms or chapels, where divine service is read. The whole number of prisoners in September 1781 was seventy-four. There is a distinct court and two rooms appropriated to women, in which were ten, but none in irons. The doors of the houses were open to allow the prisoners to walk in the courts; except the houses in the two upper courts, where, in a building occupied only by himself, I saw a Russian gentleman who was always locked up; and whose crime, I was informed, had been cruelly whipping his slaves.

One centinel stood at each corner of this prison, one at the centre of the front, three in the middle walk, and two at the entrance. In the walk there is a shed or hut for the sale of quass,* apples and bread; and on the outside of the door many boxes to receive the alms of passengers; the prisoners subsisting chiefly by charitable contributions.†

[New Government Prison.]

At the New government in a large room on the ground-floor, there were sixty-nine prisoners, of whom fourteen were women. They were petty offenders, subsisted on charitable donations, and looked dirty and sickly. In a room up stairs I saw eight criminals with irons round their necks, chained with a heavy chain to a log. In each of the rooms a soldier stood with a drawn sword in his hand.

* This favourite liquor of the Russians is a sort of sour small beer, in making which wild mint is used instead of hops.

† The prisoners here, who_are condemned to the mines in Siberia, three days before their departure go chained through the streets, crying for charity, to support them on their journey, their allowance being small.

50 APPENDIX.

[Moscow Debtors Prison.]

The prison for debtors in this city was very dirty. In five rooms I saw above a hundred miserable wretches lying on the floors, most of them half naked. At a little distance from these rooms there were six criminals in one of the most offensive rooms I ever entered.

[Military Prison.]

The Military prison is situated in the middle of a plain at about a mile from this city. It is a single room, into which were crowded one hundred and thirty prisoners, though only twenty-nine feet by twenty-six, and not nine feet high. It is constructed of wood, surrounded with wooden palisades, and furnished with two tier of barrack-bedsteads without beds. The pale sickly countenances of the prisoners bespoke oppression and misery, and prevented the wonder I should have otherwise felt at finding so large a number as fifty-five in the ward appropriated to the sick, in the military hospital. A centinel was planted at each corner, and two at the door. On the outside of the palisades there were two or three other buildings or barracks, in one of which were confined nine officers, but they had beds.

[Catherine Hospital Prison.]

At the back of Catherine hospital in the invalids court, in a prison consisting only of one room, there were fifty-two men and seventeen women. The women were employed in weeding in the garden, and the men in emptying a moat at a palace about half a mile from the prison. They had no irons, but were distinguished by a black cross on the back of their clothes. They work from morning till night, except for two hours about noon, and are allowed three copecks worth of bread in a day; but salt is withheld from them by way of punishment.

One of my visits happening to be on a Sunday, I was surprized to find the prisoners all at work; some piling and planking the canal, others cutting the barberry hedges in the palace garden, and the women weeding.

[Convent Prison.]

At a Convent about a mile out of the city, there is a room which is used as a prison for petty offenders, in which there were two men and five women. The former were employed in sawing wood, and the latter were at work in the palace garden. Their drink was water, and their allowance of bread four Russian pounds each every day.

[Lazaretto.]

Here is a palace unoccupied, which was used as a Lazaretto, in the time of the plague in 1772, consisting of near a hundred rooms round a court; the

RUSSIA. 51

[Moscow Lazaretto.]

corridors or passages are about nine feet wide. On going over it, I could not but think it was well adapted for a healthy prison, the court being spacious, the situation near the river, and the rooms, of a proper size.

[Military hospital.]

The Military hospital, founded by Peter the Great, is finely situated on a rising ground near a river. On the ground-floor there are four lofty and spacious rooms; in two of which there were eighty-eight patients, the other two were repairing. Over these rooms there are two anatomical rooms, and a third room in which lectures are read four times in a week. — Adjoining is a wooden building for lunatics, consisting of twelve rooms (fifteen feet by twelve and a half,) and a back room to each for a keeper. There are also several houses for the director, physician, surgeons, apothecary &c. At a little greater distance, but on a more elevated spot, there is a large quadrangular building, in which were upwards of four hundred patients, each room containing about thirty beds. In one part of this building there were fifty-five patients from the military prison. — At my first visit the wards were dirty and offensive; but in a subsequent visit the physician favoured me with his company, and I found them much cleaner. I flung open some of the windows in one large ward, and this purified it more than all the shoots of fir with which the rooms were strewed.*

* On conversing with the physician, concerning the treatment of the sick when the plague was at Moscow in 1772, he said, "it was nearly the same with ours in the gaol-fever, viz. bark and good broths, with as much air as possible."

The late Sir John Pringle, President of the Royal Society, in his discourse at the Anniversary meeting, 30th November 1776, informs us at page 16, that "the late Dr. Mounsey, F.R.S. who had lived long in Russia, and had been Archiater under two successive sovereigns — happening to be at Moscow when he perused the Observations on the Jail-fever — was induced to compare what he read in that treatise with what he should see in the several prisons of that large city: but to his surprize, after visiting them all, and finding them full of malefactors (for the late Empress then suffered none — to be put to death) he could discover no fever among them, nor learn that any acute distemper peculiar to jails had ever been known there. — Upon his return to St. Petersburg, he made the same inquiry there, and with the same result."

In this ancient capital of Russia, I found no traces of any such prisons or dungeons as were common, formerly in the castles of England, and in several foreign countries (see Burn's Justice, under gaol and gaoler, 8vo. edit. 1780, vol. II. p. 345.) That cruel mode of confinement in many of our prisons, has been a principal cause of the gaol-fever. I saw no symptoms of the gaol-fever in Moscow, or in any part of Russia.

52 APPENDIX.

[Moscow Botanic Magazine.]

In the garden is a building constructed of wood, for drying herbs, plants &c. many of which grow there. It is the completest house for the purpose I ever saw (eighty-one feet by twenty-eight.) A variety of plants were drying on the ground-floor, and six or seven men were employed in cleaning them, and in cutting roots. The first floor was divided into two rooms, in which were many double cases, or drawers, (the upper, half as large as the under ones) painted green, with the names of the roots and herbs they contained. The room over these, was full of herbs drying on poles; and in a balcony over the portico (six feet and a half wide) herbs, roots, and feeds are dried. All the windows and shutters in the house, and the lids of the cases, were open. Those herbs which were dry, were as green as when they were first gathered.

[Paulowski Hospital.]

Paulowski hospital is situated on an airy spot about a mile from the city. The entrance is by a flight of seven steps. It is built of wood, and only one story high, consisting of seven rooms, two of them large, and all clean and neat. — Very near, stood a building for venereal patients; but a more convenient building for such patients is just finished, containing six airy and spacious rooms hung with coarse painted linen. The apothecary lives in this hospital; and the director and two surgeons in neat houses in the spacious court belonging to it, adjoining to which there is a large garden.

[Catherine Hospital.]

Catherine hospital consists of several houses of one story; which being built round an elegant court, and painted white, have a pleasing effect. The ascent is three feet and a half.* There are in these buildings twelve rooms hung with paper and clean, with a number of beds not exceeding seven or eight in each room. A separate bed is allotted to every patient. — Thermometers are kept in the rooms of this and other hospitals, but the heat of the air was many degrees above that which the surgeon said was the proper temperature, (ten degrees of Reaumur's,) all the windows being shut. There are also small ventilators in the windows; but they can be of little use unless the windows

* The foundation of this and Paulowski hospital being stone, and elevated considerably above the level of the ground, I observed several apertures (twelve inches by seven) in the stone work, for causing a circulation of air under the floors. If apertures were also made in the floors, they would be conducive to the health of the patients by freshening and airing the rooms.

[Plate X.]

are daily opened. — I was pleased to see in every room of these hospitals a tin or pewter cistern, over a copper bason, with towels; and wished there were the same attention to cleanliness in all our hospitals.

Here were several rooms with beds for inoculated patients; but none of them had been occupied for some time. Here were also separate buildings for venereal patients. Adjoining, is another court in which there are several rooms, tolerably clean, for old military invalids. Their number was about eighty, and some of them had served as soldiers under Peter the Great. — At the front of this hospital are two pumps, by which, in case of fire, water may be easily raised to the top of the buildings.

I repeatedly visited the great Foundling hospital in this city at the particular desire of the good general De Betskoi; but having given a description of the convent at St. Petersburg, which may be thought somewhat of a digression from my subject, I refer my readers to Mr. Coxe's pamphlet for an account of this hospital.*

POLAND.

[Warsaw Town-house Prison.]

In Warsaw, at the Town-house, in September 1781, there were twenty-six men and eight women, crowded into three rooms on the ground-floor for confining debtors; the reason of which was, that the prison was repairing. Down several steps were eight new dungeons for criminals, four on each side a passage only six feet wide. There was no gaoler, the prison being guarded by soldiers.

At the prison near the palace, in two rooms there were seven prisoners, five of them in irons. Allowance a good grosche a day, which is a little more than three halfpence.

* The public is much obliged to Mr. Coxe, for the account he has given of his examination of the prisons and hospitals in his tour through the northern parts of Europe, and for the many valuable remarks which he has made, in a pamphlet entitled, Account of the Prisons and Hospitals in Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, Printed for T. Cadell. 1781.

54 APPENDIX.

[Warsaw Prisons.]

The entrance to another prison was through a guard-room full of soldiers. In one room (twenty feet by ten) were twenty-six miserable objects, some sick on the dirt floor. In another room, not so bad, there were four.

In the prison in the new city there were a few women confined for debt, and a man and woman for theft: their allowance one grosche a day.

A date on the front of a prison near the Vistula informed me it was rebuilt in 1769. There were eighty-one prisoners in it, whose beds were mattresses stuffed with straw. Most of them were employed in sawing wood and other occupations in the streets of the city for the inhabitants, who get their labour at one third less than the expence of other labourers; the public being at the same time eased of part of the expence of supporting them.

[Zugth-Hus.]

In the suburbs is the Zugth-hus, or spin-house, improperly so called, many of the miserable wretches seeming to have nothing to do. Some, however, were employed; and their allowance for working from six in the morning to seven at night, with two hours rest at noon, was two grosche (3¼d.) each day, which went to the keeper for feeding, or rather (as appeared by their looks) for starving them. The sick were lying on floors of dirt, without medical or any other assistance. This gave me so unfavourable an opinion of the police of this country, that I could feel no inclination to visit the prisons in the provinces, or, (according to my constant practice in other places) to revisit those in the capital.

[Hospital.]

The Great hospital (or Enfant Jesus) has this inscription over the gate, Regi seculorum immortali et invisibili soli Deo, Honor et Gloria. There were in this hospital near eight hundred grown persons and children of different ages. The rooms were all clean, and great attention seemed to be paid to the sick by the good sisters, according to their usual practice. Most of the children were foundlings. Those who bring them put them into a cradle hung at the outside of one of the rooms, ringing at the same time a bell, in consequence of which notice, persons attending within, turn the cradle on an axis into the house, where the children are immediately taken care of. As they grow up they are made to work in different ways suitable to their ages and sexes. I saw one hundred and thirty girls, all neat, working at their needles, and singing at the same time a hymn.

SILESIA. 55

[Warsaw Convents.]

The Convent belonging in this city to the Fratres misericordiae I found uncleanly; and it is the only instance of this to which I have been witness in this fraternity. In a second visit which I made to it, the wards were fumigated with juniper berries on burning coals.

The convent of St. Roque also I found close, crowded and offensive, the windows being kept shut.

[Hospitals.]

In the hospital of St. Martin there were many sick, of both sexes.

In the hospital of St. Lazarus appropriated to venereal patients, there were sixty-one miserable objects, in close offensive rooms. It is badly situated, and in all respects one of the worst hospitals I ever saw.*

SILESIA.

[Breslau City Prison.]

In October 1781 I visited the City prison at Breslau, built, as the date on the front informed me, in 1689. It consists of twenty-three arched rooms on different stories; in most of which there is a piece of timber on the floor with a staple in it, to which criminals may be chained. I found a prisoner or two in some of the rooms, but none in irons. — Their allowance is two pounds of bread each, a day: (one hundred and twelve of their pounds are equal to one hundred English.) To most of the rooms there are double doors, one iron-latticed within another of wood; this is a very proper contrivance where prisoners are always confined. — At the top of the staircases trap-doors are placed for preventing escapes in the night. This prison has also two dungeons down ten steps.

Near one of the city gates and opposite to the guard-room, there is a prison which consists of two circular rooms, each of them nineteen feet and a half in diameter. One is appropriated to men and the other to women; and in each

[Breslau City Prison.]

there were eleven prisoners, who were employed out of doors for seven or eight hours every day. Their allowance is two pounds of bread per day, besides fire and candle.

[Spin-house.]

In the Spin-house, situated near the river which runs through the town, there were thirty-six poor people, besides eighteen prisoners committed for offences. The former are allowed meat three days in the week; and their rooms and beds appeared clean — the latter are allowed meat only on the great holy-days; that is, four times in the year. During the rest of the year they subsist on soup, and an allowance of two pounds per day of tolerably good bread. They are employed in spinning from six to eleven every morning, and from twelve to six in the afternoon. — In the chapel belonging to this work-house, divine service is performed every Sunday and Thursday, the poor sitting on benches in the lower part of the chapel, and the prisoners in the galleries.

[Convent.]

In the Convent of the Fratres misericordiae I saw eight or ten friars serving the sick with their dinners between the hours of ten and eleven. The friars themselves dine at eleven. I went again at four, and they were going to supper. All was clean and neat.

Patients from every country are admitted into this convent; and the friars publish every year a list of the admissions and deaths. In 1776, the number admitted was seven hundred and forty-eight, and the number that died was sixty-four. In 1780, these numbers were six hundred and fifty-nine, and sixty-one.

I visited two or three other hospitals in this city, but saw nothing remarkable.

GERMANY.

[Berlin City Prison.]

AT Berlin, in the City prison called Calandshoff, there are eight rooms on the ground-floor, and down ten steps eight dungeons: these rooms (thirteen feet by nine feet four inches) were numbered, and had barracks and stoves, one stove for two rooms. The dungeons are for the more atrocious criminals, of whom I saw several in irons, who were chained to staples in the wall. In 1778

GERMANY. 57

[Berlin City Prison.]

the number of prisoners was eighteen men and thirteen women; and in 1781 it was fifty-eight of both sexes. Two of these were debtors; whose allowance is two grosche (3½d.) a day each. This allowance is paid by the creditors, and if omitted one week, the debtor is set at liberty. The allowance to criminals is one grosche and a half. The prisoners, when their process is finished, are permitted to go into the court; the men for an hour each time, at eight, one, and four in summer, and three in winter; the women for one hour only in the day, from two to three. The prisoner, at his discharge, pays the gaoler a grosche a day, for the time he was confined before his process was finished, unless the judge orders otherwise. The process ought to be finished in three months; and if it is not, the secretary is required to give account of the cause of the delay. After three months imprisonment, the fee to the gaoler is only half a grosche a day. Here is an inspector (or head-keeper,) who has apartments in the prison; an under-gaoler whose rooms look towards the prison windows; a surgeon whose salary is fifty crowns (ecus) a year, besides the pay for his medicines; a chaplain; and a secretary (greffier) who keeps the books, papers &c. The inspector's salary is fifteen crowns and twelve grosche a quarter. In a book which he keeps, the following particulars are entered in ten columns — the time when the prisoner was committed; the magistrate by whom he was committed; his name; age; religion; place of nativity; condition; cause of confinement; time of discharge; and the number of prisoners. One of the judges is obliged to visit the prison once a week.

There were only three or four prisoners in a room, none of whom are permitted to go into the court till their process is finished, (as my conductor informed me,) that confederates may not be together.

One soldier at the gate, guards the prison in the day-time; but at night it is guarded by one within, and another at the back of the prison. These soldiers are relieved every two hours.

There is no torture-room in any of the prisons in the Prussian dominions, for the present king has set the example in Germany of abolishing the cruel practice. In one of the rooms of this prison are alphabetically digested, the names and descriptions, with the sentences, of all who have been here confined, in order that should they be found here a second time, they may suffer a much severer punishment.

[Court Prison.]

In the Court prison (Haus-Voighty,) there are seven cells for criminals, and over them eight rooms for debtors and smugglers. These rooms look into a

58 APPENDIX.

[Berlin Court Prison.]

court, to which prisoners have access two hours in a day. All the rooms have barracks and stoves as in the other prison.* Here are two or three good rooms for debtors adjoining to the keeper's apartments, and several rooms in a back court. Creditors allow each debtor two grosche a day, and one for firing, besides paying one to the gaoler. Here were thirty-six prisoners in 1781; nine of them criminals in the cells. — Allowance to criminals is one grosche a day. I here saw two of that sort of vests for punishment, called Spanish mantles, (similar to those mentioned at Copenhagen,) one weighed fifty, the other seventy-five pounds: they are sometimes worn at the gate of this prison, and by smugglers at the custom-house, one, two, or three hours.

[Maison de Travail.]

The Maison de Travail, is a spacious building in the suburbs: it was erected in 1758: the front is two hundred and twenty feet, the sides a hundred and sixty. It has a court in the centre. The number of inhabitants in 1778 were about four hundred and fifty, including fourteen children, and in 1781 five hundred and forty-six. Beggars, idle persons, and petty offenders of both sexes are sent to this house. Those who can work are employed, fed, and clothed; and proper care and attention paid to the aged and infirm. Every time I was there, I was pleasingly struck with the cleanly appearance of all the inhabitants. Old and young, men and women, were spinning and carding wool, in rooms about seventy-five feet by twenty-four.† All have clean linen once a week; and I observed a towel hanging up in each room. The apartments are white-washed once a year: this gives freshness and neatness, and also light to the work-rooms. Here is a chapel with two galleries, one for each sex; and an apartment for the chaplain. The hall for meals is spacious: the hours, seven, twelve, and seven. I was present at dinner-time; after ringing a bell, in ten minutes all were seated at about twenty tables,

* Here the criminals had fire in all the stoves, though early in October. On my observing the propriety of this, the gaoler asked me, whether criminals had not fire allowed them in my country? On my saying that in some prisons they had not; he replied, "How then do they exist in winter?"

† My minuteness with respect to measurements and other circumstances relative to the construction and government of these buildings, will require no apology with those, who consider, that in the formation of new establishments it is of use to be acquainted with many things which, though apparently trivial, are frequently of material consequence to the purposes intended to be answered.

GERMANY. 59

[Berlin Maison De Travail.]

eighteen to each table. Four separate tables were at a little distance for criminals. A servant having called out, the school-master prayed at the desk in the middle of the room. And after all had helped themselves with barley soup,* while they were eating, he read part of a chapter in the Bible; then sung an hymn, in which the children, who were all at one table, joined; after which, all went out and fetched their cans, each containing about a quart, and they were filled with small beer. After spending about half an hour at dinner, they had half an hour for recreation. The whole was conducted with the greatest regularity.

In the hall are morning prayers, at which all must attend clean, and then they take their bread for breakfast. The inhabitants are divided into two classes, the poor — and criminals. In 1781 there were eighty-six of the latter class, who are more confined than the poor. Both classes have the same nourishment, except that the first have meat twice a week, and the second only on Sunday. Their weekly talk is twelve pieces (or knots,) each weighing five ounces: if they do more, they are paid for it. When they are sick, they are sent to the great hospital: (where the rooms are too much crowded.) Dinner for the second class — on Sunday, pease and half a pound of meat; Monday and Friday, beans or lentils; Tuesday and Saturday, flour; Wednesday barley; Thursday, pease.

This house resembles the old rasp or work-house at Amsterdam. It is exceedingly neat, and such great attention is paid to all confined in it, as prevents every ground of complaint. The strict and good police preserves the city of Berlin entirely free from beggars.†

[Orphan House.]

In the Orphan house there were forty-six boys and forty-one girls, all healthy and cheerful, and employed in spinning wool in two spacious rooms.

* I tasted the barley soup, the bread and the beer, which were wholesome and good, and they had enough. They have butter or cheese, with their bread for supper.

† That the police is indeed strict and extensive I had some evidence by weighing the bread from various parts of the city; all which exactly agreed with the assize or standard. In June 1778, the fine white bread was something above three halfpence a pound; and there was just double the weight of rye bread for the same money. In October 1781, three pennyworth of the finest was 1lb. 14oz; of the second sort, 3lb. 7oz: and of the third, 5lb. 4oz. The bakers here and in Silesia, gain much more by the fine bread, than by the coarse; this is designed for the advantage of the poor. — Here the price also of the several sorts of butchers meat is fixed and published.

60 APPENDIX.

[Berlin Orphan House.]

I looked into their bed-rooms and observed them to be clean and airy, having opposite windows which were thrown open. — From seven to nine o'clock, and from one to three, they are at school; and from nine to eleven, and three to six, they work.

There are two infirmaries in which there was only sick child. This house exhibits a contrast to that at Copenhagen; though the employments of the children, which my conductor there pretended to be the cause of their cutaneous disorders, are the same.

[Spandau Fortress.]

At Spandau, about ten miles from Berlin, are two prisons. The fortress or castle is surrounded with water. Thirty-six state prisoners were confined in it in 1778, and a hundred and five criminals. Some few of the latter were rasping logwood; the task for each thirty-six pounds a day: but most of them were spinning. The criminals are badly lodged, and there seems to be little attention paid to them. In 1781 there were a hundred and fourteen prisoners. Here were none but men, for no women are ever permitted to continue a night in the castle. They had a light chain to each foot, and such as were taken after an escape had a collar of iron.

[House of Correction.]

In the house of correction there were about a hundred and fifty persons, spinning, knitting, and carding wool for a manufactory in Berlin. Forty-seven of these were men, committed for small offences. They have meat only on Sundays in this and some other houses of correction. Here were some rooms with silk-worms, on which the female prisoners attended. Neither this, nor any foreign houses of correction which I have seen, are without a chapel.

In 1781 there were seventy men and one hundred and ten women. The apartments of the latter were neat and clean. Their dinner was good soup made of barley: but the bread was not so good as at the work-house at Berlin; the daily allowance was twenty-two ounces, together with two quarts of beer. A few sometimes work more than their task, and are paid for it. A distinction is made between the prisoners, and such as are reckoned infamous, are confined in a room by themselves. I made the same inquiry of the keeper here that I had made in similar houses, whether the work of the prisoners maintained them? The same general answer was given, no, no.

[Magdeburg.]

At Magdeburg the Prussian slaves were at work on the fortifications, serving the masons, digging sand &c. Their daily allowance is two pounds of bread, and on the days they work, they have also in money, half a grosche, about

GERMANY. 61

[Magdeburg.]

three farthings. The number was only fifty-one, for many had been taken to recruit the army.

In the other prisons, nothing seemed worthy of observation: but in the bouse of correction (which was formerly a convent) was a mill to grind or beat the logwood that the men rasped; and two or three large chambers of silk-worms, on which the women attended.

If I may judge, by what I saw of the here, and at Spandau, and by the few prisoners in the spacious areas, all their apartments are not so dreadful as some imagine; nor are all the persons confined in them unhealthy and miserable objects.*

[Lukau.]

The house of correction for Lusatia at Lukau is a spacious prison. The men were treading in a large wheel to grind corn, five and five by turns. Some of them had iron collars, as at Bern, but no irons on their feet. The prison for the women was a distinct building; their employment was spinning.

[Dresden.]

At Dresden, the apartments for the slaves being under the fortifications, must be unhealthy. I saw four sick, and yet they had their irons on. Among those that were at work, one had an iron collar, by way of punishment, for making an escape, besides the broad iron about his leg. Another was sitting, and endeavouring somewhat to alter the place of his iron. He told me, that the weight was marked on it twenty-one pounds, and that he could not have it changed to the other leg without paying a smith.

[House of correction.]

Here are two other prisons. The house of correction has ten or twelve rooms, each about ten feet square, with one window, and an aperture over the door, and barrack bedsteads. There were ten prisoners, five of each sex. Three of the men were rasping logwood in a room down twenty steps and the other two were employed as labourers in building a chapel. This prison and the orphan-house, is, very improperly, one building.

The other prison for the bailliage, contains nineteen chambers, in which were twenty-six prisoners; most of whom had a chain (some on one foot, some on both) fastened to a staple in the wall. The prison was dirty; and the gaoler's pan of charcoal and frankincense (which his negligence rendered

[Dresden.]

necessary) could not prevent its being very offensive. Here was one debtor, who had from his creditor six grosche (ten pence halfpenny) a day. The criminals allowance is one grosche (about seven farthings) each.*

[Prague Prisons.]

There was nothing very remarkable in the two prisons at Prague. The men at the Maison de Force, work out, with a guard, sawing wood, &c. for twelve creutzers a day†, which is less than the common wages of labourers. The prisoners themselves receive only four for a day's work, the rest is paid to the house. Many were thus employed, with chains to one or both legs, according to the different terms of their confinement.

[Vienna.]

At Vienna in 1778, I visited all the prisons, and most of the hospitals. The prisons are old buildings, and afford no instruction.

[Prison.]

The front of the great prison, La Maison de Bourreau, is remarkable for a very striking representation of the crucifixion of our Saviour and the two thieves on mount Calvary. In this prison are many horrid dungeons.‡

[House of Correction.]

In the Maison de Force, or house of correction were a hundred and sixty-nine men, and a hundred and forty women. The were employed in carding, spinning and knitting. I was present on a Monday morning, when they brought their week's work, for which, after it had been weighed, they received

* On paying my acknowledgments to the grand bailiff for permitting me to see the gaol, I took the liberty to observe, that I had fecn prisons cleaner. I mentioned also the severity of chaining women, which is very uncommon in other countries. To this he answered, that " the gaoler chained them for security, being often obliged to be absent in fetching prisoners from the country." In return, I gave my opinion that the attention to a prison ought to be the sole work of a gaoler, without which, little regard will be paid to cleanliness or humanity.

† A creutzer is near a halfpenny.

‡ Here, as usual, I inquired whether they had any putrid fever, and was answered in the negative. But in one of the dark dungeons down twenty-four steps, I thought I had found a person with the gaol fever. He was loaded with heavy irons, and chained to the wall: anguish and misery appeared with clotted tears on his face. He was not capable of speaking to me; but on examining his breast and feet for petechia or spots, and finding he had a strong intermitting pulse, I was convinced that he was not ill of that disorder. A prisoner in an opposite cell told me, that the poor creature had desired him to call out for assistance, and he had done it, but was not heard. This is one of the bad effects of dungeons.

[Vienna House of Correction.]

their pay. They have all that they earn for themselves. A few received twenty-six creutzers each, others less. The keeper was employed in putting the name on the work of each prisoner, and setting down the money that was paid, and the cotton delivered. The prisoners saw the cotton weighed, and took as much as they could spin in that week.* At dinner-time, several large pans of soup and beer were brought in, and the prisoners bought what they thought proper.

The prison was too much crowded,† the house not being built for the purpose to which it is applied. In several rooms the men were carding and spinning. In one room, some of them, who were taylors, were making clothes for the soldiers; in another, some were weaving coarse linen at eight looms; and in another room, they were making thick blankets for the convents. Two more rooms were warehouses for cloth, stockings, coverlets &c. manufactured in the house for sale. They were then white-washing the house.‡ In the chapel is a proper separation of men and women. Here, and at Prague, and in some other parts of Germany, they have iron grate doors, which do not prevent the circulation of air, so salutary and necessary in houses of confinement. Too little attention is paid to the lodgings of the prisoners, for they have no coverlets.

Though I could not mention with commendation the prisons of this city, yet I must acknowledge, I was greatly pleased with the public buildings for the indigent, the aged, and infirm; which do honour to the citizens in general, and especially to the late Empress Queen.

[Alms-house.]

The great alms-house in the suburbs consists of three courts. The front of this spacious building is six hundred and thirty-seven feet; the sides, eleven hundred and fifty-three. The inhabitants are near three thousand, including the military invalids. It was agreeable to observe their order, neatness, and

* In the holidays, when the prisoners are not permitted to work, each has an allowance of four or five creutzers.

† One or two of the women were crying, and charging others with rising in the night and stealing some of their cotton. The mistress believed the complaint, but said she was not able to prevent such frauds, because there was not the convenience of separate apartments.

‡ It is the general rule in Dutch and German houses of correction, to white-wash them once or twice a year. I seldom neglected to enquire about this practice, as we have a clause relative to it in a late act for preserving the health of prisoners in gaol.

64 APPENDIX.

[Vienna Alms-house.]

cleanliness. Here poverty and old age appeared with a smiling aspect. Many of them were seventy or eighty years of age. They were cheerfully spinning, because whatever they could gain was to be their own.

[Hospitals.]

Les Freres de Charite have not only wards for the sick in their convent, but these friars have also another airy and commodious house with gardens, to which they remove their patients when they begin to recover. In this were two wards up stairs, and each ward had fourteen beds.

The noble Hospital for bringing up children, was the plan of one person, whom I left engaged in the improvement of his liberal design. In sixteen rooms for boys, were five hundred and thirty-nine beds, and two hundred and forty-one in eight rooms for girls. The extent of the front is six hundred and sixty-two feet.

In the great alms-house, and in several prisons and other public buildings, the rooms are all arched with stone or brick, to prevent danger and confusion in case of fire.

Before I leave this city, I would just mention, that every month, an account of the price, weight and measure of bread and flour, is put up on the gates.*

[Gratz House of Correction.]

At Gratz (the capital of Stiria) I observed in the house of correction, that the prisoners had an appearance far more healthy than those I had seen in a similar house at Vienna. They have beds and coverlets, and the guards see that the men take off their clothes at night.

[Laubach.]

I omit particulars concerning the prison at Laubach in Carniola, as I cannot say a word in favour of it.

[Trieste Prison.]

At Trieste, the prison consists of eight or ten very close offensive rooms, each having only one small window. The pale countenances of the (nineteen)

* The bills I observed were dated July 1, 1778. Seven sorts of bread were mentioned in them. The finest was (by my weights) exactly one pound for three halfpence of our money. The second sort was one pound and six ounces for a penny. Inferior sorts made of rye were cheaper. I commonly examined the price, and the strictness of this part of the police, in most large cities that I visited, to compare them (as I said) with our own at London.

The bakers at Vienna are punished for frauds by the severity and disgrace of the ducking-stool. This machine of terror, fixed on the side of the Danube, is a kind of long pole or board extending over the water, at one end of which the delinquent, being fattened in his basket, is immersed. The bakers would gladly purchase a removal of this machine, but the punishment is continued and inflicted by order of the magistrates.

[Trieste.]

prisoners bespoke their own misery, and the negligence of the magistrates and keepers.

[Castle.]

But in the Castle were eighty-five slaves (Condannati) who seemed healthy and well. They were confined for three, five, seven, or fourteen years and upwards; and were employed on the roads, in the harbour, &c. Some of them were at work in a large lighter,* clearing the harbour, just under my chamber window. To prevent their escaping, they were guarded by six soldiers. They did not work harder, than other labourers would in the same employment. Their hours for work were from five in the morning till between five and six in the afternoon; but they had two (from eleven to one) allowed them for rest, and half an hour more sometime before they left work. They appeared healthy, clean, and strong; and laboured cheerfully, because when they were employed, each of them received, as extraordinary pay, three farthings a day. Their common allowance was two pounds and a half of bread and four farthings a day. I heard them called over, and saw them receive their pay, before they entered their chambers in the castle. Their bread was sweet and good, such as I should have been happy to have found in many parts of my tour. They were treated with humanity, though under strict discipline; were well supplied with food and clothes; had two shirts, two pair of stockings, &c. and they lay in good beds† with coverlets, in large airy rooms having opposite windows, and not, like many convicts, in close dirty dungeons under the fortifications. They were distinguished from other labourers by a light chain on their legs, and a chain supported by a girdle of leather at their waists.

* Two wheels were fixed in the lighter, one of them to draw back the scoop or bucket, and the other (by the weight of ten men treading in it) to raise the mud, which was then emptied into another lighter managed by the overseer of the work. Three or four times a day, a soldier (with a bayonet fixed on his musket) accompanied a convict, who went to fetch a tub of fresh water, and on his return he supplied each with a tumbler of it while they were at work in the wheel. By the mast of the other lighter, a sail was spread to shade them, the weather being very warm, Farenbeit's thermometer 85°.

† May not one great cause of the unhealthiness of our prisoners be, the want of proper bedding, which obliges them to lie in their clothes? How different did these prisoners appear at the castle from many that I have seen in Prussia and at Vienna! I was struck with the same good appearance of the women prisoners at several of the spin-houses in Holland. This reminds me of what I heard an old general say, "That he always found his men subject to illness and diseases when they lay in camps, not from dampness, but from lying in their clothes and the want of proper bedding; for at the same time all his officers had been quite healthy and well." Whatever be the cause of this difference, whether a more free perspiration in bed, taking off bandages, or ventilation of the clothes, I am fully convinced of the fact.

66 APPENDIX.

ITALY.

I entered Italy in 1778 with raised expectations of considerable information, from a careful attention to the prisons and hospitals, in a country abounding with charitable institutions and public edifices.

[Venice Prison.]

At Venice,the great prison is near the Doge's palace,* and it is one of the strongest I ever saw. There were between three and four hundred prisoners, many of them confined in loathsome and dark cells for life; executions here being very rare. There was no fever, or prevailing disorder in this close prison. None of the prisoners had irons. On weighing the bread allowance, I found it fourteen ounces. I asked some who had been confined many years in dark cells, whether they should prefer the galleys? They all answered in the affirmative: so great a blessing is light and air! The chapel is only for the condemned, who continue there a night and a day before execution.

Regulations were hung up in the prison. — Here is a charitable society established for the relief of prisoners both civil and criminal, and rules are published for the direction of the officers who have the management of it, of whom four are appointed visitors of the prison. There are likewise rules for the good government of the two infirmaries. These I procured from the ducal printer, with the regulations for the galleys and prisons, for many years past.

[Galleys.]

One of the galleys was moored two boat's length from the shore, in which were only twenty-seven slaves, who were kept here in order to be sent on board the other galleys. This was clean. Here, and in the other galleys, which were dirty and crowded, the slaves were in chains of about twenty-seven pounds weight.†

* The rooms for the state prisoners are over part of the palace on the leads, which renders confinement in the heat of summer almost intolerable.

† I saw a slave dead on the shore, who I suppose destroyed himself in despair, for he could not hope to escape by swimming, because of his heavy irons.

ITALY. 67

[Padua.]

I visited the prisons of Padua and Ferrara: In the former of these cities, none of the confined debtors would sit on the elevated stone stool* in the great hall; and I was informed that not one had submitted to the ignominy these ten years.

[Bologna.]

At Bologna are three prisons; one of which is for debtors, who are alimented after four months and three days confinement, at one paule (about six pence) a day each.

[Hospital.]

The hospital, S. Maria de Vita, afforded me great pleasure. All was clean; and the wards were lofty, and not in the least offensive. The wards of the men and women were of the same size, each containing thirty-eight beds, nineteen on each side. The bedsteads were of iron, and the coverlets were white and clean. Each ward had fourteen windows, seven on a side, and all had curtains. They had folding wooden casements; and on the outside, wire lattices.†

[Florence Prison.]

In Florence are two prisons.‡ In the great prison, Palazzo degl' Otto, were only twenty prisoners. Six of them were in the secrete chambers, which are twenty-one strong rooms. None of the prisoners were in irons. They had mattresses to lie on. Their bread was good. In the torture chamber, there was a machine for decollation, which prevents that repetition of the stroke which too often happens when the axe is used.

* This is sometimes called the stone of disgrace; for if they who are insolvent would avoid imprisonment, at a time fixed they must sit upon it in a disgraceful manner three times.

† The wards of this hospital were thirty-two feet and a half wide, and the beds were three feet two inches wide, and three feet eight inches asunder. In the middle of each space of the wall between the beds was a cupboard, with a shelf, concealed by a small curtain; and over each curtain was a slip of black marble with the number of the bed. On the sides of all the wards, for the convenience of opening and shutting the windows, was a gallery eighteen feet above the floor, and two feet broad, with a light rail two feet nine inches high. The doors to the wards were iron grates, five feet five inches wide.

‡ Dr. Targioni, who had an order from his royal highness to inspect the hospitals, and report what beneficial improvements might be made in them, accompanied me in visiting these prisons.

68 APPENDIX.

[Florence Prison.]

In the other prison, Delle Stinche, there are five doors to pass before you come to the court. The opening of the first is three feet wide, and four feet nine inches high, with an inscription over it, Oportet misereri, (We ought to be compassionate.) In this prison are many spacious rooms, in which are small benches, or cribs to lie on. The men's rooms are below, and look into the court, which is about forty-three feet square. The women, entirely separated, are up stairs, and have an hospital joining to their room. A new infirmary for the men (forty-four feet by twenty-nine) is contiguous to the chapel. In this prison were forty-two men and fourteen women. Debtors are not separated from criminals. In one room were eight, who paid for their beds. The bread was good: the day's allowance to each fifteen ounces. None were in irons. - The chaplain has apartments, and resides in the gaol.*

[Hospitals.]

The great hospital of S. Maria Nova was crowded and too close; though the men's fever ward was four hundred and fifty-four feet long, and thirty feet and a half wide. They have separate wards for wounds and fractures. The women are attended by the Nuns, who have a passage under ground from the opposite convent. Here are twenty students, who lodge and board in the house for seven years, attend the sick, serve the victuals, &c.† and are distinguished by a long cloak.

But the hospital which I most frequently visited, was S. Giovan di Dio.‡ The ascent into the sick ward is by a flight of thirty stone steps. This ward was lofty and clean; and was a hundred and twenty-three feet long, and thirty-three and a half wide. There were in it thirty-three beds, three feet four inches wide, placed on varnished boards,‖ on iron bedsteads.

Neither the sides nor floors of this, and the other hospitals of Italy, were wood, that being more retentive of scents or infection than tarras or brick.

* This prison has something similar to the plan I proposed. A wall surrounds three sides of it; but being very high, and only eleven feet and a half distant, it renders the prison too close.

† I saw a friar or capuchin come in form and bless the meat or soup for dinner. The numerous patients seemed entirely satisfied with this, without any devotion of their own.

‡ The great attention of this order of friars to the sick, in every country where they have hospitals, does them honour.

‖ This is very conducive to cleanliness, and secures patients from vermin.

[Florence Hospitals.]

At one end there are five rooms with single beds for sick priests. Three of them were occupied.

The hospital S. Paolo della Convalescenza, for the reception of recovering patients, has clean and airy apartments, and a spacious refectory, or dining hall. They continue here four days, and by the change of air and diet their health is confirmed before they go to their several occupations.

Here I would just mention an alms-house, S. Bonifazio, for infirm persons of advanced age. It has eighty beds for each sex, and they were fitting up twenty more. The wards are thirty feet wide, all clean, and shew the care of the Nuns who attend on this charity.*

[Leghorn.]

In the prison at Leghorn were three debtors, and eight of those called prisoners at large, and in the secrete three criminals. I mention this prison because of the infirmary, which, as appears by an inscription over the door, was built at the expense of the present governor, Philip Borbonio, in 1761.

[Fortress.]

The slaves in the fortress† appeared healthy and well; better, as the old keeper remarked, since they have lain on shore.‡ Each prisoner had a ring round one leg but when they go out to work, a chain is rivetted to two prisoners. Here were seven pontons to clear the harbour but the weather, when I was there, being stormy, they could not be worked. There were forty-seven slaves employed at the new Lazaretto, which is a noble spacious building, with different apartments for officers and their men to perform quarantine, and large warehouses for the cargoes of their ships.‖

The old keeper generously ordered his son to copy for me all the rules, from which I shall here give some extracts.

* I cannot leave Florence without expressing my great obligations to the Grand Duke for his permission to inspect the prisons, and making my acknowledgments to Sir Horace Mann our ambassador, for his very kind attention and assistance.

† In this fortress, there were a hundred and thirty-two slaves: at Pisa, were eighty-five: and at the Grand Duke's salt-works at Port Ferrara, seventy.

‡ Galleys or bulks ought to be the punishment only for the most atrocious crimes.

‖ I wish some future traveller would give us plans of this Lazaretto, and that at Ancona and other places, as they might suggest some useful alterations in the construction of our hospitals and other public buildings.

[Leghorn Fortress.]

Three keepers have their salary from the Grand Duke. They receive a copy of the process against every convict, carry it to the government, and register it in the proper book; and when required, they must give an exact account of all proceedings against the prisoners. They make a report of the refractory to government, that they may be punished in proportion to their offences, with severer confinement, irons, and bastinadoes. The principal keeper has power to choose two turnkeys out of the best-behaved prisoners, who are to exhort and instruct the others: but the keeper is to have a strict watch over them. He must order that all prisoners, when they are brought in, have their heads shaved, - be dressed in the uniform of the house, - and have irons on their feet.

The prisoners are condemned to labour, for thirty, twenty, ten, or seven years, or for a shorter term, according to the nature of their crimes; and are chiefly employed on the public works. They are sent out every morning, under a guard of soldiers, and are chained two and two together, with a chain of about eighteen pounds weight. An hour's relaxation is allowed them at breakfast, and two hours in the afternoon: and at an hour before sun-set, they are reconducted to the prison, and must be well searched by the keepers, to prevent their having any thing concealed: and two hours after sun-set, they are ordered to go quietly to rest. When they are employed on the works by his royal highness, they are paid two crazzies (about three halfpence) a day; but if employed by other persons, they are paid four or six crazzies, according to the nature of the work. At day-break, the turnkeys ring the bell to awake them: and a report is made by them to the keepers, if any have been guilty of irregularities during the night. Their daily allowance is a loaf of thirty ounces (which is made two thirds of flour, and one third of bran,*) and soup made from four ounces of pease boiled in water, with salt and oil. On each of the two Easter holidays they are allowed a pound of meat, and three ounces of rice. Every two years they have a coat of gray cloth, a waistcoat of red cloth, and a red cap; every year a pair of shoes; and every six months a shirt, and a pair of drawers or breeches. Their drawers are shifted once a month, their shirts every week. For lodging, they have a mattress filled with straw, and a coverlet: the straw is changed, and kept in good order. - If one attempts to desert, and be taken before sun-set, he must wear a ring, and a chain of

eighteen pounds weight; and he must pay half his future earnings, till it amounts to a zechin,* to those that apprehended him. If they who are condemned for five years, desert, when retaken, their term again commences: and for repeated desertions, they are more severely punished, and sometimes tortured.

The chaplain must instruct the prisoners.

In the hospital there must be all proper provisions for the sick and infirm, viz. veal, mutton, rice, fine bread, broth, good wine, &c. A physician attends, and the diet and medicines must be according to his prescription. On entering, the patients have clean linen, shirts, night-caps, and clothes. And the keepers and turnkey must examine their victuals and soup, to see that they be good, and that the quantity be according to the physician's orders.†

[Rome New Prison.]

At the great prison at Rome, called the New Prison,* at the back of which runs the Tiber, on a stone tablet over the door, is this inscription:

NOVUM CARCEREM

To Justice and Clemency,

For the more secure and better custody of criminals,

Pope Innocent X. erected this New Prison,

In the year of our Lord

1655.

On the ground floor, on one side are the slaves for the galleys at Civita-vecchia: on the other side is a sort of cook's shop, and a tap-room, over which are the women's apartments, five of whom were in the secrete chambers, and twenty more at large. - There are eighteen of these strong rooms for the men, which are close and offensive, each of them having but one window for admitting light and air. These rooms are never opened without an order from the governor of the city. There were sixty-eight prisoners. They are not permitted to go out of their rooms at any time, but for examination. - Some having been confined there many years, appeared with pale sickly countenances, but none were in irons. Here is a chamber for distracted prisoners, in which were seven miserable objects. There are several chambers with beds for those who are called prisoners at large, for which each pays one paule and a half (about eight pence) a night. There is a chamber for priests, one for boys, one for Jews, and one for prisoners who have cutaneous disorders.

On the upper floor are two infirmaries: one, appropriated to the prisoners in the secrete, in which were four patients: in the other, which is for the rest of the prisoners, were ten patients the first time I was there, and the last time only seven.†  The

* The elegance and simplicity of the front of this prison occasioned me to give a plate of it.

ITALY. 73

[Rome New Prison.]

whole prison is arched with brick, for security in case of fire. The passages are seven feet two inches wide, and light. The ascent to each story, is by two flights of seventeen stone steps. These staircases are feet three inches wide; the rises five inches: this I mention, as generally, in our prisons (even those that are lately built) the stairs are narrow, the rises high, and the passages dark and inconvenient. There is a table of regulations by the authority of the magistrates hung up in this prison, ordering the exact times, of opening the prison and the court, of saying mass daily, and of distributing the alms. The times vary twice in a month, according to the different length of the days. In the same table, the physician is ordered to visit the sick in the infirmary every morning, and in case of extraordinary illness, in the evening. I wish I could say I had seen no torture-chamber. On the side of the great prison there is a pulley and rope (see the plate) to draw up malefactors by their hands which are tied behind them; after they have been suspended some time, by being suddenly let down part of the way, their arms are dislocated.*

In the prison at the Capitol are two rooms for poor debtors, and for criminals whose offences are not so great as to cause them to be confined in the secrete.

The prisoners in one of these rooms, have the privilege of asking alms of the passengers. There were five debtors in rooms which they paid for, and two criminals in the secrete. This prison is not offensive. There is a constant current of water through one of the large rooms.

[San Angelo.]

The state prisoners are confined in the castle of San Angelo. The rooms appropriated to that purpose were all empty, except one, in which was a bishop, who had been confined upwards of twenty years, and was distracted. Here

* See an account of this mode of punishment at Rome in Dr. Moore's View of Society and Manners in Italy, vol. I. p. 476, third edit. This Letter (44th.) is well worth perusing, in which the ingenious writer describes the manner of execution at Rome, with pertinent remarks, and concludes with these questions. "When criminals are carried to execution with little or no solemnity, amidst the shouts of an unconcerned rabble, who applaud them in proportion to the degree of indifference and impenitence they display, and consider the whole scene as a source of amusement; how can such exhibitions make any useful impression, or terrify the thoughtless and desperate from any wicked propensity? If there is a country in which great numbers of young inconsiderate creatures are, six or eight times every year, carried to execution in this tumultuous, unaffecting manner, might not a stranger conclude, that the view of the legislature was to cut off guilty individuals in the least alarming way possible, that others might not be deterred from following their example?"

[Rome San Angelo.]

were also eighteen condannati who work in the fortress, and had each a light chain. They seemed healthy and well.

On the death of the Pope,the prisoners are brought hither from the great prison, for upon such occasions the prisons are thoroughly cleaned.

I can give but little information respecting the prison of the inquisition. It is situated near the great church of St. Peter's. On one side of the court round which it is built, is the inquisitor general's palace. Over the gate is an inscription importing "that it was erested by Pope Pius V. in the year 1569." The windows of the prison have wooden blinds, and at a small distance is a high wall.*

[Fraternity.]

In this City, and many others in Italy, is a Confraternita della misericordia, called S. Giovanni di Fiorentini.† It consists of about seventy, chiefly nobles, of the best families. After a prisoner is condemned, one or two of them come to him the midnight before his execution, inform him of the sentence, and continue with him till his death. They, with the confessor, exhort and comfort him, and give him his choice of the most delicious food. All the fraternity attend the execution, dressed in white. When the prisoner is dead, they leave him hanging till the evening; then one of the fraternity, generally a prince, cuts him down, and orders him to be conveyed to the burying-place which they have appropriated to malefactors. I was there the twenty-ninth of August, the only day in the year when this burying-place is opened to the public. - Adjoining an elegant church is a chapel, which makes one side of a court, and on each of the other three sides, is a portico supported by Doric pillars. In the middle of the pavement‡ of the front portico the women, and in one of the side porticos

* The chambers of this silent and melancholy abode were quite inaccessible to me; and yet I spent near two hours about the court and the priests apartments, till my continuance there began to raise suspicion.

† Many of Florentine extraction were the founders. This institution is ancient, for the church of S. Gio. Battista Decollato belonged to them in 1450.

‡ Here are marble squares, in which are circular apertures for the interment of those that are executed. Round these stones is inscribed,

"Domine, cum veneris judicare,

"Noli nos condemnare."

O Lord, when thou shalt come to judge,

do not condemn us.

[Rome.]

the men are buried. The latter are interred in the same dress in which they were hanged; for in Italy, coffins are not in general use.

[S. Michele.]

The hospital of S. Michele is a large and noble edifice. The back front is near three hundred yards long. It consists of several courts with buildings round them. In the apartments on three sides of one of the most spacious of these courts, are rooms for various manufactures and arts, in which boys who are orphans or destitute are educated and instructed. When I was there, the number was about two hundred, all learning different trades according to their different abilities and genius. Some were educated for printers, some for bookbinders, designers, smiths, carpenters, taylors, shoemakers, and barbers; and some for weavers and dyers, a cloth manufacture being carried on here in all its branches. When the boys arrive at the age of twenty years, they are completely clothed, and a certain sum is given to set them up in the business they have learned. In the middle of the court is a noble fountain, and there are several inscriptions to the honour of the founders of this excellent institution.

Joining to another court are apartments for the aged and infirm, in which were two hundred and sixty men, and two hundred and twenty-six women. Here they find a comfortable retreat, having clean rooms and a refectory. I conversed with some of them, and they appeared happy and thankful.

Another part of this hospital is a prison for boys or young men. Over the door is this Inscription:

In the room is inscribed the following admirable sentence, in which the grand purpose of all civil policy relative to criminals is expressed.

Here were fifty boys spinning, and in the middle of the room* an inscription hung up,

SILENTIUM.

In this hospital is a room also for women. On the outside is an inscription, expressing, that it was erected by Clement XII. in 1735, for restraining the licentiousness and punishing the crimes of women.

[Hospitals.]

There are in Rome many hospitals for the sick, but they were in general crowded, yet none of them had more than one patient in a bed. In the great hospital of San Spirito in Safia,† there were, the first time I visited it, a thousand and fifteen patients; the second time, eleven hundred and three.‡ The hospital of S. Gio Laterano was also crowded and offensive; and that of S. Giacomo degl' Incurabili was worse:‖ but that called Benfratelli, that for the

* This room being different from any I had before seen, I had a plan taken, which may give a clearer idea of it than a verbal description would do.

† Formerly many nations founded hospitals in this city. This was founded by one of our Saxon kings. Some others continue to the present time entirely national, as the Milanese, Florentine, and Spanish hospitals.

‡ Here is a staircase remarkable for its ascent being very easy, for valetudinarians, and for carrying up the sick in a kind of chairs or enclosed beds. It is seven feet wide, and has a rail on each side. Every step is an inclined plane of three inches ascent, one foot eight inches wide, and the rise from one step to another is only three inches. These steps are of bricks, set edgeways, and fronted with stone.

‖ Indeed I saw the hospitals under great disadvantages, it being a very sickly time, occasioned by the long continuance of drought, and the extraordinary heats of the summer 1778.

[Plate: House of Correction.]

ITALY. 77

[Rome Hospitals.]

Florentines, that of S. Maria della Consolazione,* were clean, and perfectly free from any offensive scents. In this last-mentioned hospital, no patients are received except such as have wounds or fractures. The Gallicano, another hospital in this city, is solely for cutaneous disorders.

Before we take our leave of Rome, it may be proper just to mention the hospital for pilgrims and convalescents. Recovering patients, when dismissed from the other hospitals, may enter into this, and reside here three days, lodge in airy wards, dine in the refectory, and be well attended.

[Civita-vecchia.]

The Pope's galleys are at Civita-vecchia. The slaves condemned to them are confined for different terms, according to the nature of their crimes: but the shortest time is three years for vagabonds, who are generally employed on board the pontons in clearing the harbour. For theft, the term is never under seven years. Persons convicted of forgery are always confined for life; and if found guilty of forging bank-notes, or any instruments by which large sums have been lost, they are punished with an iron glove. Prisoners for life are chained two and two together: those for limited terms have all a single chain, and, at their first arrival, of the same weight; but when they have no more than one or two years to serve, they have only a ring round their leg, which is lessened as the end of their term approaches. For escapes, they are obliged to finish their first condemnation, and then receive a fresh one for the same time as the former; but if the first was for life, the same is renewed, and they receive from a hundred to two hundred lashes a day, for three days after their arrival. None are sent to the galleys under the age of twenty: criminals of a younger age are kept at the hospital of S. Michele in Rome till they are of age; and are there employed in spinning, and fed on bread and water.

The allowance to each slave is three pounds of bread a day; and fifty-five pounds of beans or calavances to each galley, with which they generally make a kind of soup once in two or three days, and they are allowed two pound and a half of oil to boil with their beans. At Easter, Christmas, and Carnival, they are allowed one pound of beef and half a pint of wine a man, and twenty-five pounds of rice to a galley.

For their clothing, they have once in two years, a striped woollen capotto and waistcoat, two shirts, two pair of canvass breeches, and a woollen cap;

* At night, two chains are put across the street over-against this hospital, by an order of Pope Alexander VII. in 1661, for the purpose elegantly expressed in the inscription,

Ne pratereunte strepitu Quies Amica silentii

Omnino ab aegrotantibus exularet.

78 APPENDIX.

[Civita-vecchia.]

and every year, two feet and a half of woollen cloth to wrap round their legs instead of stockings. The yearly expence of each slave for maintenance, clothing, and chains, is computed at fifteen Roman crowns and eighty-seven baiocs, about £3: 13:9.

At the time of my being at Civita-vecchia, three of the galleys were out on a cruize, and two only remained. Through the whole night there was great silence (as I lay in a felucca close to them,) though about four hundred were chained in each of the galleys. The slaves here are constantly employed, and have what they earn for themselves, being paid according to their abilities and the nature of their work. For sawing in the arsenal, they are paid two pence a day each; for working as masons, two pence halfpenny; for carrying stones and mortar, only a penny. Such as work at the canvass and calico manufactories are paid from two pence to eight pence, according to the quality of the work, &c. At the public works they are allowed an hour for dinner, and in summer-time an hour for breakfast.*

[Hospital.]

Here is a spacious hospital on shore for the slaves. None were in irons. All was clean. In the centre of the great room in this hospital was an altar for public worship. A particular room was appropriated for such as had cutaneous disorders, and another for consumptive patients.†

[Naples Prison.]

The principal prison in the great and populous city of Naples‡ is La Vicaria, under the courts of justice. It contained when I was there, according to the

* For the preceding account I am indebted to our countryman Mr. Denham, who has the superintendence of the Pope's galleys.

† In this country, the physicians are persuaded that the consumption is a contagious disorder. Patients afflicted with it in hospitals have a separate ward. The same precautions are used to prevent infection as in the plague. When this disorder has been in private houses, the furniture is removed, and the rooms are scraped and fumigated, before they are again inhabited.

‡ An account is taken every year of the inhabitants of this city; and at Easter 1777, their number, exclusive of soldiers and marines, was 350,061, viz.

Males - 170,574

Females - 165,642

Priests - 3303

Monks - 4231

Nuns - 6311

Of this number there were born in the year immediately preceding, 6029 males, and 5571 females. The deaths in that year were 9553.

gaoler's account, nine hundred and eighty prisoners. In about eight large rooms communicating with one another, there were five hundred and forty sickly objects, who had access to a court surrounded by buildings so high as to prevent the circulation of air. In this court was a reccfs, under arcades like those that were under the chapel at Newgate. Some of the prisoners were employed in knitting, and others in making (hoes but most <?f them were entirely without employment. In six chambers, which opened into a spacious hall, were many beds for such as could pay for them. Adjoining was a chapel, and a spacious infirmary for the whole prison; in which were forty persons, in single beds, with (heets, coverlets, &c.* In seven close offensive rooms were thirty-one prisoners, almost without clothes on account of the great heat: and in six dirty rooms communicating with one another, were fifty women. Of all the prisoners, one man only was in irons, in a dungeon, near a small chapel which is allotted to the condemned before execution. — The bread was good: the daily allowance to each was twenty-two ounces.

There were three other prisons: one contained eighty prisoners, another near sixty, the other but eleven.

The galleys were moored about ten feet from the fiiore. In the first were two hundred and sixty slaves; in the second, two hundred and ninety-eight; in the third, two hundred and seventy; and in the fourth, four hundred; most of them stout and healthy. All were chained two and two together. Their bread was hard, but sweet. About twenty-six ounces a day was allowed them; and when employed in the arsenal and other public works, they have an extraordinary allowance of near a penny a day. After escapes, if they are retaken, their whole term is doubled. Each galley has a chaplain, and public worship on Sundays and Holidays.

In the Seraglio, or great Alms-house,f there were about five hundred and fifty prisoners (condannati) in eight or nine rooms. Many of them work as

labourers on this great building, with chains varying according to the terms of their confinement; and have the extra allowance just mentioned, with five ounces of flour for soup. In these rooms were shoemakers at work, as in some of the galleys; but most of the prisoners had no employment.*

This great building is to be a receptacle for the aged and infirm; and for beggars and idle persons. There is a great number of the former in some rooms that are finished, and which have windows into a court, where they were digging a foundation for a large church, by which the numerous inhabitants will be deprived of the salutary effects of the circulation of air.

[Hospitals.]

The galley-slaves have an hospital on the shore† fronting the bay, entirely appropriated to them and their guards. It has four or five spacious and airy wards, cleaner than most of the other hospitals in this city. One of these rooms is only for the guard of the marine. The patients are distinguished into three classes; very ill — sick — and recovering. Great attention is paid to them: and they are allowed good bread in sufficient quantity.

The great and crowded hospitals of S. Apoatoli and L'Annunziazione, have wards appropriated to the cure of wounded persons.‡

The hospital of the Benfratelli, or S. Gio. di , is clean and elegant. It consists chiefly of one lofty ward; at one end of which is an altar and a room for poor priests; and at the other end, a table, on which are placed the

I The frequency of assaults and assassinations in Italy is generally known. Many of the common people seem to be insensible of the atrociousness of the crime of murder. I have heard criminals in prison express, with seeming satisfaction of mind, "that though they stabbed, they did not rob." If we consider that wards and even hospitals appropriated to the wounded are filled with patients, that the prisons are crowded, and that many are continually taking refuge on the steps of churches, and examine our accounts in Janssen's Lists and the Judges' Returns, we may reckon that there are more murders committed in a year in the city of Naples or Rome, than in Great Britain and Ireland. Does not this prove that the English are not naturally cruel? And might not arguments be derived from hence, for the revisal and repeal of some of our sanguinary laws? The Marquis Beccaria justly remarks, in his Essay on Crimes and Punishments, chap. 2S. "That the punishment of death is pernicious to society, from the example of barbarity it affords."

Their daily allowance was thirteen ounces of good wheaten bread for each, besides soup. To this prison belongs an hospital and a chapel, with a large room to which the condemned are brought four days before their execution. — The instructions formed for this prison by the supreme Jyndics, are hung up in it, and contain good regulations, as will appear from the following account of a few of them.

"The keeper shall have under him six assistants: — and the said keeper is to be responsible, and liable to punishment, if any of the assistants shall be guilty of the lead fraud or neglect in their employment. — The advocate fiscal is once a week, at any time he shall think proper, but when he is leaf expe£led> to visit the cells of the prison, and to inquire diligently how the prisoners are treated by the keeper and assistants, in order to give information to the most serene senate, &c. — When any prisoner is condemned to death, he is immediately to be put into chains. — The keeper is always to keep the chapel shut, except at the time of celebrating mass, confession, or administering consolation to the unhappy. — He is also to take care that the prisoners do not play at any,

particularly cards. The last order is, that this table of regulations be fixed up in the criminal court of justice, in the chancery, and in the apartments of the criminals."

Galleys.

Hospitals.

The hospital for the galleys is on floore; and in it are hung up the regulations, which consist chiefly of such orders as the following:

"That five superintendents shall be appointed by the magistrates, who every month shall draw lots, to determine which of the galleys they are to inspect. — That exact lists of the crews, and of the sick in the infirmary, with an account of the time of their admission, shall be taken and kept, with the assistance of the physician, chaplain, and surgeon. — That the secretary shall keep a register of all things necessary to be provided; bread, wine, meat, pease, beans, rice, &c. &c. — That four caldrons of broth shall be allowed weekly to a galley, besides kettles of broth statedly given them in the three winter months. — That when the superintendents discontinue the allowance of meat, cheese, oil, and stockfish, the chaplain shall fee that each of the slaves be served daily with half a pint of wine. — That the physicians shall keep exact accounts of their orders of meat, wine, pastry, &c. — That the captains and midshipmen shall take care that all the regulations be exactly observed."

The Turkish slaves had many little shops on shore, for selling coffee, perfumes, &c. and for shaving; like those I remember to have seen about fifteen years since at Marseilles. The bread allowance to the slaves is three pounds and a half, for two days in summer; and three pounds in winter.

In the great hospital there were about three hundred men, and six hundred women. All sick persons of any nation are admitted into it; and it is one of the best and least offensive of the public hospitals of Italy. Here was a room and ward for foundlings, crowded and close; and the poor infants were cruelly bound, hands and feet, with bandages, as in the hospital at , and

other cities in Italy.

There were also in this hospital apartments for the insane. But these apartments were close and dirty; and the calm and , I found inhumanly confined in the same room with the noisy and turbulent.

The Albergo hospital,situated on an eminence within fight of the harbour, is an asylum for boys and girls. There were in it a hundred and seventeen of the former, and four hundred and eighty-two of the latter. It is something similar to the noble and well-regulated hospital of San Michele at Rome. Over the door of the great room, where numbers were spinning and weaving, is this inscription

[House of

In L'ArgaJlro there were three hundred and fifty-nine prisoners, healthy and strong. A considerable number of them were at work in public: J but in the Correctio house there were at work shoe-makers, tailors, smiths, wheelwrights, cabinet- , makers, turners, nailers, rope-makers, leather-drdfers, painters on gauze, spinners and weavers. Many here learn trades, so that there is a probability, that when their term is finished, they will become members of society;

which should be the grand objebl in all such houses. They receive for them-selves one third of what they earn, and two thirds go to the house.

Their dormitory is a spacious room, with three stages in it on which they lie. In the centre of the cieling are four large apertures, and sixteen small ones. ||

There are two courts, a pump, and running water for walking the linen of the prisoners, which they shift once a week. § The daily allowance to each

* The general fisc of these rooms is eleven feet by twelve to fifteen. In some were only one or two persons, but in others fix or eight: the windows are towards a high wall eleven feet distant. These are some of the strongest and most retired rooms in the Italian prisons, in which the most atrocious offenders, and those who are imprisoned for life, are confined. They are inaccessible bqt by a special order. The entrance is guarded by two doors, between which is a narrow space, just sufficient to admit two persons. Into this you are locked before the turnkey opens the inner door, for fear these desperate criminals should murder the keeper for the keys, and attempt to rulh cut.

f In this great trading city, there were only four persons confined for debt.

J They water the ilreets and public walks (at the expence of the city) there being nineteen small waggons for that purpose; fix men draw, and one attends behind chained. Others repair the pavements, &c.

tj A prisoner, whose employment was drawing designs and patterns, gave me a plan of the rooms and courts in this prison.

§ I observed to one of the prisoners, that they were cleaner than most working men: he replied, " or else the confinement would be intolerable.'*

is thirty-five ounces of good bread,* and a mess of good vegetable soup. They have two hours for dinner and repose. All had a chain to each leg. If any escape and are retaken, the whole term is renewed, and half as much more.

In this house there is an hospital, a chapel, and an apartment for the chaplain.

The Cajadi Correzione is now (1778) building, on a noble and spacious

plan.f The dormitory and the work-rooms for the men are finished and occupied. J In one of these work-rooms there were forty looms employed weaving linen, cotton, and diaper: in which also, and in two others opening into it, were warping and twijling-mills, and winding-wheels. Under these was a calender: and some were employed in heating (not carding) cotton. In a detached temporary building I saw a prisoner employed in weaving gauze; who (as I conjectured from the great resort to him) was reckoned curious in this art. With the afiiflance of some whom he employed, he kept four looms at work. Other prisoners were bleaching the cloth manufactured in the house. And some were at work as masons and labourers, in this great building.

Over the work-rooms is the great hall or the room for boys, and the infirmary. The dormitory is lightsome, airy and clean, and appears evidently to be an improvement on that of San Michele at Rome. || It consists of a great room (one hundred and twenty-four feet by thirty-one)§ near the end of

# One loaf was equal to the daily allowance of two prisoners; it was divided into two equal parts with an engine, and each received his o<wn portion every day.

+ The Count de Firmian, late governor of Lombardy, whose amiable character is well known to our English travellers, not only honoured me with the plan, but favoured me with every advantage for examining the prisons.

J The two work-rooms for the women (just finished) are large and lofty; and in each there are five large windows, placed high above the floor. At one corner of these rooms are stone basons, with water laid in to them.

|| I therefore insert the plan of this also.

$ On each side of the hall are three stone galleries, two feet eight inches wide, with iron rails. The chambers are numbered, amounting to one hundred and twenty: these are all similar, nine feet two inches by eight feet two; they have one window* outward, three feet by two; and one towards the great room, two feet five inches by one foot five: they are furnished with a bed and bedding, a stool, and a vault. In the infirmary, and the dormitory for boys, as well as in the great hall, there were stone finks and water laid in.

which there is an altar with a cupola over it: on one side of the altar is the dormitory for boys, and on the other the infirmary; and all together make the figure of a cross, which is the form of many hospitals in Italy and other Roman catholic countries.

There were near three hundred prisoners in this house; twenty of whom were chained to two benches in the dormitory, but at the same time employed in spinning, or making and mending clothes. There are two or three rooms, adjoining those in which they work, occupied as warehouses. All the prisoners work in irons.

In visiting the great hospital,my expectations, which had been too much raised by the accounts of travellers, were disappointed, Most of the wards are on the ground-floor, and not lofty, as there are rooms over them. They are also dirty and offensive, though provided with spacious drains. They had a middle row of beds, and in many of the beds were two persons: bur care was taken to separate the patients in fevers from those who were attended by surgeons.*

The hospital of S. Gio di Dio exhibits that cleanliness and attention, which this fraternity always discovers.

In the hospital for orphans, called Ld Stella, the work and bed-rooms were

spacious, neat and agreeable. There were three hundred girls in it; whose employment was making lace on round pillows.f

In the prison at the Citadel of Turin there were one hundred and seventy Turin

in irons; some had the half-chain, others were chained two and two together. Citadel.

These prisoners continue always unemployed, till they are fent to the galleys at Villa-Franca. Their unhealthy countenances plainly shewed the little attention paid to them. — In this prison there was a chamber for convalescents, who not being fit for labour, are continued here forty days before they are fent to the galleys.

t

In the great hospital of S. Giovanni there were a multitude of old men and Hospital. women, whose apartments had a very improper communication with the wards of the sick and dying.

* Most of the chirurgical patients had been wounded in sudden quarrels or assaults.

f I wished them a more healthy employment, and that they had used the square pillows of Flanders; for constantly (looping must be prejudicial, f'uch. as are thus employed are generally of a pale and sickly complexion.

In the hospital of La, Carita, there were about two thousand inhabitants, mostly boys and girls.

Here also is an hospital for lunatics, where, with pain, I saw wards crowded with beds, and in some of them miserable creatures chained and raving.

[Chamberry Prison.]

At Chamberry I found that the salutary practice of washing the prison was adopted. Besides the stated allowance of good bread, the prisoners are often supplied with bread and soup, and in winter with clothes and coverlets, by a charitable society of ladies. In one of the rooms I saw chains; but was told they had not been used since the walls had been built higher. A dismal torture-chamber, into which day-light never enters, makes a part of this prison.

[Geneva Prisons.]

At Geneva I revisited the prison which was formerly the bishop's palace. There were in it two debtors, and five other prisoners; to whom great attention was paid, as they were then laying new floors, left the rooms should be damp and injurious to their health.*

In the house of correction there were no prisoners.

SWITZERLAND.

In entering Switzerland from Geneva, a traveller will be suprised to meet frequently with a gibbet on the road, if he be not informed that almost every seigneurie or bailiwick has a prison, and possesses the power of trying criminals and capitally convicting them. I visited one of these prisons. It belonged

* I hoped to have found here no torture chambers, but I had only the pleasure to hear that none had suffered in them these twenty five years. They are thus restrained by the thirty second article in the Reglement de l'illustre Mediation pour la pacification des troubles de la Republique de Geneve, published in 1738, "Les accuses et criminels ne pourront être appliqués a la Question ou Torture, que préalablement ils n'ayent été par jugement definitif, condamnés a mort."

to Mr. Baron de Prangins, and consisted of four rooms at the top of this castle.* It was empty: and this is commonly the case with the prisons in this country, in consequence of the virtuous education and industry of the inhabitants.

At Freyburg there were no prisoners except a few in the house of correction. The men convicts are employed abroad in cleaning the streets, &c.
---
There were none confined in all the prisons at *, except in the two houses of correction. In that for the city, the men and women were spinning. In the other, called the Scallenhaus, there were a hundred men and forty-one women, who were in separate apartments, and three different.rooms assigned to each sex according to their different crimes and the terms for which they were condemned, f They were all employed either in the house or abroad, except fifteen, who seemed miserable for want of employment. J

Some of the women were employed in spinning. I saw them bring in their week's work, and after it was examined, receive twenty-seven pounds of flax for the following week. At that time some of the town's people purchased the flax that had been spun, and paid for it to an who lives near

the prison.

As the employment of the men convicts in the streets is somewhat similar to their employment at Milan, I give a representation of it from a draught taken by a painter in this city; I have also given a view of the employment

* I observed the same thing at the castle in the isle of Gorgona in Italy, where were two rooms at the top of the building for prisons. this is different from the ancient cruel mode of confining prisoners in pits and dungeons of castles.

f An old keeper having left the door of one of the men's wards unlocked, twelve prisoners forced the outer door and walked off; the people, who happened to see them, suffering them to pass, because they supposed they were going to work in the streets. When four or five of them some time after were retaken and carried to their old lodgings, the magistrates ordered that they should not be punished, considering that every one must be desirous of gaining liberty. As they had not been guilty of assault or violence in making their escape, the punishment fell on the keeper for his negligence.

I As some employment is absolutely necessary; when the crimes are of such a nature as to allow or require indulgence, it should be given them by shortening their term of confinement, or in some other way, instead of allowing them to be idle. I have seen this false indulgence to prisoners in several places.

of the women, though I detest the custom of daily exposing that sex to such ignominy and severity, unless, when they are totally abandoned, and have loft all the foster feelings of their sex.*

At Zurich there is a prison, situated in the middle of the river, for capital crimes :f and a house of correction. In the latter, which is convenient and spacious, there were about sixty prisoners. Nineteen of the men worked abroad for the citizens, who paid them for their work, but not so much as other labourers. The rest were spinning within doors or working at some trade.

I observed one woman colouring botanical prints. They have a chapel in which they attend divine service, and are catechised every Friday. Once a day, such of them as do not work abroad, (by the advice of one of the physicians,) walk under arcades in a large square court; during which time, their rooms are thoroughly aired, the doors and windows being thrown open. They have good bedding; and they are well supplied with bread and soup every day, but no meat. The prisoners on entrance have the hou/e clothes, and their own are hung up, with their names, and the time of their commitment, noted upon them.

On inquiring of one of the magistrates, if they any of their

criminals ? he seemed surprised at the question, and asked, if I did not see in the mountains many manufactories ?

There were no prisoners at Schaffhauf, except three in the house of correction.

* Will it need an apology if the mode of publishing the assize bread in this city be jull mentioned? It is better than that ax. Vienna and several other cities. In the middle of the window of every baker's shop is hung up in full the bill on pasteboard, specifying the weight and price of three different sorts of bread, and, at the bottom, that of the fine rolls. The bills are signed by the magistrates secretary. If the price continues the same the following month, the secretary notes it on all the bills. I copied one of these bills, and purchased the different sorts of bread, which I found to be for rather over weight. The prices were, ‘whitebread, 1lb. five creutzers ; houshold, 1lb. four and a quarter; brown bread, 1lb.

three creutzers and a quarter; (a creutzer is near a halfpenny.)

+ Here was only one prisoner. The first room was for examination; in it were five different weights for torture, and if we may depend on tradition, the heaviest, which is one hundred and twenty pounds, was used in torturing a burgomaster of this city.

GERMANY. 89

In this country (I said) great care is taken to give children a religious education; and that there are but few prisoners. The chaplains instruct, and pray with those confined in the houses of correction. No visitants are admitted on Sunday. Thus a principal object here, is to make them better men. This, indeed, should always be the leading view in every house of correction; and the earnings of the prisoners should only be a secondary object. As rational and immortal beings, we owe this to them; nor can any criminality of theirs, justify our neglect in this particular.

From the excellent manner in which houses of correction are conduced in this country, as well as in Holland,by regents or inspectors, whose motive

for attending to their duty cannot be large falar'tes ;* I am (till more confirmed in the opinion I before advanced, that no mercenary views should be held forth to the persons to whom such an important trull is committed. Nor can I doubt, that in our own country, as well as abroad, men might readily be found, who merely from a sense of duty, and love to humanity and their country, would faithfully and diligently execute such an office, with no other reward than the approbation of their fellow-citizens., and of their own consciences. In fact, we find, that there is no want of respectable persons among us, to undertake the government of and houses of indtiflry upon

these principles.

From Switzerland I returned into Ge, in 1778, to visit some prisons which I had not seen, particularly those in the free or imperial cities.

GERMANY.

AT Augsburg, the prison is on the side of a hill, at the back of the town-house.

It consists of many cachots or small rooms, on three different floors. There is one for examination, and there are two for the engines of torture, f The condemned are brought three days before their execution into two light rooms.

* See Mr. Coxe's LetUrs from p. 463.

f There are also two dark dungeons for such as have been convicted of witchcraft: but they are in a very ruinous condition, and seem to have been a long time without inhabitants.

which open into a Roman catholic chapel: where, however, if a prisoner be a protestant, a Lutheran minister is permitted to attend him.

The house of correction consists of buildings on two Tides of a spacious court; one side for those of the Roman catholic religion, and the other for protestants, with a chapel for each. The rooms were all clean, and are white-washed every year. Opposite to the front windows in most of the rooms, were high windows, of a semicircular form, which were designed for promoting a circulation of air.

At Munich or Munchen, there are two prons for criminals. One in the town-house had in it fix men and two women prisoners.* In a dark damp dungeon down seventeen steps, were the instruments of torture.

The. other, called Ld Prison de la Coury consists of about fifteen cells, twelve feet by seven, and a black torture-room, f

In the house of correction were about forty men and thirty women; some weaving wide cloth, but most of them spinning. The keeper ordered his servant to attend me with charcoal and frankincense; a certain sign of negligence and inattention, which the countenances of the prisoners confirmed.

I was agreeably relieved from the pain excited by these scenes, with the view of the two hospitals of Les Freres and Les Sceurs de Charite. In the former

* Once a year, <viz. on All-faints day, any persons are permitted to enter and fee the prison. There is a custom similar to this in Holland, at the Fair and other fixed times.

f In this room there is a table covered with black cloth and fringe. Six chairs for the magistrates and secretaries covered also with black cloth, are elevated two steps above the floor and painted black. Various engines of torture, some of which are stained with blood, hang round the room. When the criminals suffer, the candles are lighted; for the windows are shut close, to prevent their cries being heard abroad. Two crucifixes are presented to the view of the unhappy objects. But it is too (hocking to relate their different modes of cruelty. Even women are not spared. — This room seems very much like the torture-room in Spain, described in Limborcb's History of the Inquisition translated by Chandler, vol. II. p. 221, 4to. edit. t€ It was a large under-ground room, arched, and the walls covered with black hangings. The €f candlesticks were fattened to the wall, and the whole room enlightened with candles placed " in them. — The inquisitor and notary fiat at a table, so that the place seemed as the very mansion of death, every thing appearing so terrible and awful."

were about forty beds; in the latter, twenty: the wards wrere about twenty-six feet wide. All was neat and clean, still and quiet; and the great attention paid to the patients was every where apparent. I saw the operation of bleeding performed by the nuns with great dexterity and tenderness. Over the foot of each bed a text of Scripture was inscribed, as in some Italian hospitals.

The prisonat Ratijlon or Regensburg is in the town-house. Many of the chambers are airy, and most of them have stoves. There are no dungeons, but three dark cellars for torture, at which two senators, their secretary, and the hangman with his valets affilt. At Munich and some other places, a surgeon always attends; but I heard of no such custom here.

At the back of the orphan-house is the house of , in which were only

two women.

At Nurenburg, the prison is under the town-house. There are fifteen steps

down to the gaoler's kitchen. The apertures for admitting light into the passages of the dungeons are level with the ground. This is one of the worst prisons I ever faw. The dark unhealthy dungeons, and the dismal torture-chamber,* do no honour to the magistracy of this city. — The gaoler makes use of a low trick to prevent the escape of his prisoners, by terrifying them with the apprehensions of falling under the power of witches. In several of the German gaols there are dungeons for thole that are guilty of witchcraft, but they seem to have been long disused: and I hope increasing light and good sense will soon entirely banish the fears of witches, and consequently the witches themselves.

In one of the city-towers in which lunatics are confined, there are three or four rooms for criminals of higher rank.

The prisoners in the house of correctionf were employed in grinding spectacle-glafies. The surplus of what they earn above forty , or eighteen pence

in two large rooms; and others, in different apartments, were employed in polishing steel buttons for clothes, wire-drawing, and making spinning wheels: and I was informed that twelve were at work on the road. The women were spinning.

This house was clean and well regulated. The gaoler readily supplied me with a book containing an account of the regulations, &c. in which are fbme liberal and sensible remarks that appear worth transcribing.

It is observed, " that there is great error in expelling that a house of this * kind should be able to maintain itjelf; since with the ftri&eft oeconomy, a considerable annual sum will be found necessary for its proper support."

The greatest attention to cleanliness is inculcated} bathing rooms are provided for the prisoners; and the expence of washing for them is reckoned an object not to be regarded.

The necessity for sick wards for both sexes is pointed out.

It is remarked, c< to be a very false notion, that a man who lives upon bread and water can work hard and be kept in health accordingly, as will be seen in the table subjoined, a daily allowance of hot provisions is ordered for the criminals.

It is mentioned as an essential point to preserve order, and prevent abuses,

" that one of the city magistrates should every week in rotation visit the house, and closely inspefl every thing relative to its management."

Such prisoners as have been publicly whipped are called *, and are

distinguished from the rest, by having a particular place appropriated to them in the chapel, and by being made the last in receiving the sacrament. The

* The men grind seven glades in each hand. Some grind four hundred in a week, by which they earn fifty-two creutzers at thirteen for a hundred, and consequently each earns for himself twelve creutzers a week. That this is a very unhealthy business, is evident from the

countenances of those whom I saw thus employed, and from the disagreeable sensations I always received from the dust in the rooms where they were grinding. The medical gentlemen prescribe bleeding and physi to these persons, two or three times a year.

the wheels; or in working on tobacco-boxes, {huff-boxes, &c. A large warehouse contained the goods they had finiftied. In summer, many of them are employed in sawing without doors; but in winter, they work in rooms: for were they to attempt this work abroad, a sudden frost might endanger the materials, but would certainly render it impossible to use the faw. The pale countenances of the prisoners were a sign that their work was laborious, and that the keeper had the whole profit.

The women were spinning worsted, and appeared objects of companion. Their dirty rooms, sickly looks, and cutaneous complaints, evidently bespoke inattention and neglect.*

In the house of correction at Wurtsburg were fifty-four men and thirty-six women, employed in a well-regulated woollen manufactory. * In one part of the house they were spinning; in another, picking and carding wool; and in another, weaving wide cloth for the soldiers, j- and also flocking and waistcoat-

* I have a book of the regulations: but of what advantage are the belt rules when not enforced ? It may be of use, however, to give some idea of the nature of these regulations, which seem, on the whole, well planned. After mentioning that the two sexes are to be kept separate, and also the honnetes from the infames; a chapter is given, treating on the Means of Correction, under three heads, i. Religious instruction, in which the Chaplain's duty is amply laid down. He is to read prayers twice a day, preach and catechise on Sundays, and employ the most solemn and earned exhortations occasionally. 2. Labour. Idleness being judly considered as the source of most vices, great attention is paid to a condant employment of the prisoners. The nature of this employment has been mentioned in the text; but I think it proper to quote one observation from the book of regulations, which is, that it is of advantage to have part of the work of a kind that any person, though incapable of the common labour, may be employed in it. Such is the turning of a wheel, which even a blind man may perform. 3. The various punishments of the refractory.

A subsequent chapter treats on Diet, Clothing, and Cleanliness. The allowance is two pounds of wholesome bread daily, and something hot for dinner. Meat only on a few holidays. For the sick, there is an addition of four pfennings a day for board. All the money, however, is paid to the keeper, who finds the provisions. Concerning cleanliness it is observed, that the want of it not only occasions diseases of the body, but also tends to the corruption and debasement of the mind.

t The wheels were larger than cur spinning-wheels, the diameter being four feet. Here, and at most houses of this fort, are large looms (six feet seven inches wide) and two persons work at each loom. In a warehouse, the manufacturer (for all such houses have a manufa&urer) shewed me several pieces of cloth for the under officers, the artillery, the soldiers, and the hospital or poor-house.

pieces. — The women were all spinning or carding in one large room. As their spinning was of various kinds, there was a room with cupboards, where each person's work was laid up separately. The talk for each man or woman was eight creutzers, or three pence halfpenny, a day. Here is a Roman catholic chapel, and the priest lives in the

At Francfort (on the Maine,) there are five prisons. One is for debtors, where I found only three, who were alimented at ten , about four

pence a day, payable by their creditors.

The prison called Ld Four de Ste. Catharine was empty. Here is a light room, to which criminals are generally brought from the great guard prison, just before their execution. The men are hanged, and the women beheaded; but executions are very rare in this city.

In the house of correction (near the work-house) were three prisoners, two women and a man. The man was at work with two or three others in the court, beating to powder a porous stone, which is worked up with water, and makes, when dry, a hard cement or coat of plaster. The two women were employed in the work-house.

In the tower at Cologn, there were no prisoners either for debt or for capital offences. In this and many other cities, the magistrates will not permit a debtor who has no effects to be confined. This city has not the power of executing criminals; but when they are condemned, they are delivered up to an high officer of the elector's, and confined in a dungeon in his house. I saw one thus confined when I was here some years ago.

In the house of correction, the men were beating stone to powder with small wooden mallets, as is pra&ifed at Francfort The women were spinning, or knitting (lockings.

The great prison at Aix-la-Chapelle was unoccupied. — In the guard near the Maison de Ville there were two prisoners; one of whom was a very old man with irons on his hand, who was confined on suspicion, and had twice suffered the torture to force a discovery of his confederates. •

Executions are not frequent in this city.* Citizens are always executed by decollation, which is performed by the broad sword, as at Hamburg, Bern, &c. and not by a machine, as in some parts of Italy-, nor by the axe, as in England, Denmark, ike.

The two prisons (distinguished by the names of the and th near

Ld Porte de St. Leonard in Liege, are on the ramparts. — In two rooms of the old prison I saw fix cages made very strong with iron hoops, four of which were empty, j- These were dismal places of confinement -, but I soon found worle. In defeending deep below ground from the gaoler's apartments, I heard the moans of the miserable wretches in the dark dungeons. The sides and roof were all (lone. In wet weather, water from the fojfes gets into them, and has greatly damaged the floors. Each of them had too small apertures, one for admitting air, and the other, with a shutter over it strongly bolted, for putting in food for the prisoners. One dungeon larger than the rest was appropriated to the sick. In looking into this, with a candle, I discovered a stove, and felt some surprise at this little escape of humanity from the men who con-ftrufted these cells.

The dungeons .in the new p-ifonare abodes of misery still more (hocking; and confinement in them so overpowers human nature, as sometimes irrecoverably to take away the senses. I heard the cries of the distracted as I went down to them. One woman, however, I saw, who, (as I was told) had sustained this horrid confinement forty-seven years without becoming distracted.

The cries of the sufferers in the torture-chamber may be heard by passengers without, and guards are placed to prevent them from flopping and listening. A physician and surgeon always attend when the torture is applied; and on a signal given by a bell, the gaoler brings in wine, vinegar and water, to prevent the sufferers from expiring. — tc Lhe tender mercies of the wicked are cruel." Thus in the Spanish inquisition, the physician and surgeon attend to determine the utmost extremity of suffering without expiring under the torture. J *

* In this and many other cities, the convict knows not of his execution, till three days before the time. Then he is constantly attended by his confessor, and indulged in the choice of food.

I will only add, that in this prison there are rooms appropriated to prisoners en pension; that is, to such as are confined by the magistrates, at the desire of their parents, guardians or relations. A shocking practice! which prevails also in some of the neighbouring countries.

In the Maison de Force there were ninety prisoners, ranged in four rooms,

and employed in a woollen manufactory of linings for soldiers clothes. Persons live in the house who well understand the business, and instruct the prisoners in forting, carding, spinning, twilling and weaving. None of them were in irons. All had separate beds, and were supplied with good rye bread, — meat three times a week — two quarts of beer, for each, every day — and soup every other day. — The chaplain, who lives in the house, favoured me

with his company through the work-rooms, lodging-rooms, and the refectory. He entered into the true spirit of this institution, and lamented the inconvenience of the house, as not being built for the purpose to which it is applied. He took notice of the propriety of solitary confinement for thole that were riotous and refractory at their first coming; for generally, he said, " in four or five days they would become very tradable and submissive."

At Brussels, I revisited the prison La Porte de Halley which confilts of twenty-four chambers (seven feet and a half by seven) distinguished by the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, and each prisoner had a separate room. There were forty-nine prisoners, June 17, 1783. In some large rooms there were five or six men, and in one room at the top of the house ten women (vagrants). Here is no court. The torture is not abolished: the gaoler told me he had seen a man suffering on the torture-Jlool for forty-eight hours.

Debtors are sent to another prison the creditor is obliged

to advance a month's aliment. In 1778 I saw there an who had

his wife and two or three children with him but they were not permitted to stay at night.

Some tailors and shoe-makers were at work; but most of the men were occupied in the manufacture of paper-hangings; carving the moulds, grinding the colours, and staining the paper. The •women prisoners were entirely separated from the men, and were employed in making lace. In December 1781 this house was empty, for the prisoners had been removed to Vilvorde, to apartments less airy and convenient.

VlLVORDE

House of Correction.

The new house of correction at Vilvorde was occupied in 1781. There were a hundred and sixty-eight men and eighty-six women, clothed in an uniform of light-coloured cloth. They are divided into three classes; and the class to which each of them belongs, together with the number that distinguishes his room, is marked in red, on his clothes and linen. The principal employment of both sexes was spinning cotton; but some of the men were weaving,

others making clothes, or shoes; and some of the women were spinning flax, others mending the linen, or making lace. — Most of the floors are of plaster, and cannot be washed. There were separate work-rooms and refectories to each class, which I found offensive, the windows being all shut, though the weather was calm and fine. But the passages, into which all the bed-rooms open, were much more offensive. When I saw this house before it was inhabited, I conjectured this would be the case, and though I took the plan, I did not chufc to publish it.

While I was there, a prisoner was brought in: he was immediately

lhaved — examined by the surgeon — walked — clothed in the uniform- — and then conduced to his class.

There is a room for the magistrates, but, on account of its distance from Brussels, they too seldom attend. The countenances of the prisoners, evidently bespoke inattention and neglect. The regulations for this house were published at Brussels Feb. n, 1779, in two edicts; the first, for the direction of the governors, in French and Low-Dutch; the other, for the discipline of the house, in French, containing sixty articles, which are well worth attention, in any

country where similar houses are erected.

In the Bishop's prison,at the back of his palace, there are several cages which open into small offensive rooms. In June 1783, there were three prisoners.

In the hospital in this city there are two halls; that for men (a hundred and eighty feet by fifty-three) is vaulted, and lofty as a church.

I went over the house of correction (La Maison de Force) with one of the magistrates in 1778, and found that they were still carrying on a well-regulated manufactory. There were two hundred and eighty men prisoners, and one hundred and seventeen women. These latter had on the clothes, and were at work. Most of them were spinning or knitting, ranged in proper order, attentive and tjuiet. I was informed that all the prisoners were allowed one fifth of their earnings for themselves. I brought home specimens of the,

as I did of the paper from Brussels; which I mention, because I know an idea has prevailed, that no manufacture can be carried on by convicts to any valuable purpose.

The number of criminals in December 1781 was two hundred and six. They were spinning — weaving — making nets — making and mending clothes — or working in the bake-house and kitchen; and appeared clean and healthy. The doors of the bed-rooms were open while they were out in the day-time; and none of the rooms were in the lead offensive. — In another quarter, the number of petty offenders was one hundred and six, who were employed in the same manner with the criminals above-mentioned, except some who worked as carpenters, turners, and smiths, for the use of the house. On the women's side there were a hundred and fifty, who were washing — spinning — making and mending the linen — or at work in the kitchen. Their bread, soup and meat were good and plentiful, and all bespoke the care and attention of the director. If, however, I venture to point out some defects in so good an institution, that others may avoid them, I hope to be excused. — The rooms and corridors are too low — the infirmaries are not sufficiently detached — there are not proper work-rooms — the women have not separate dormitories — the sewers are improperly placed — the distribution of provisions, being but once a day, is not frequent enough — and the bowls, being of wood, cannot easily be kept clean.

The architect not having provided a sufficient number of work-rooms, the two that werejately erected, were much more crowded than those at,

and yet they were not like them, offensive. This surprised me at first, till I considered that the difference was owing probably to the clothes of the prisoners at Vilvorde being of wool, and the particular offensiveness of the bed-rooms there. — A lift of such prisoners as behave well is annually fent to the Emperor (about Good Friday). In 1782 twelve received their pardon.

At my visit in 1783, I found here a great alteration for the worse; the flourishing and useful manufactory destroyed; and the looms and utensils all fold, in consequence of the Emperor's too hasty attention to a petition from a few interested persons. That which ought to be the leading view in all such houses, is now loft in this house. Many formerly ascribed the comfort and happiness of their lives to the trades they here learned, and the attention bCre paid them; but now, the men, and women (the former three hundred and twenty-six in number and the latter a hundred and fifty) do not earn, one with another, seven farthings a day. Their victuals are also reduced the meat

FLANDERS. 101

from half a pound to fix ounces, and greens from three to two farthings worth a day. Their bread, made in the house, is now ammunition-bread. In confe-quence of this vile policy, I found the aspect of the prisoners quite changed; nor could I wonder to hear that a quarter of the house is soon to be fitted up

before the torture. — A criminal, while he suffers the torture, is clothed in a long shirt, has his eyes bound, and aphyfician or surgeon attends him: and when a confession is forced from him, and wine has been given him, he is required to sign his confession; and about forty-eight hours afterwards he is executed.

In a small dungeon is a stone feat like some I have seen in old prison towers, in which it is said that formerly prisoners were suffocated by brimjloney when their families wished to avoid the disgrace of a public execution. No person here remembers an instance of this kind; but about thirty years ago there was a private execution in the prison. — In this prison in 1778 there were only two prisoners. In November 1781 there were three prisoners for debt; their allowance was three halfpence a day. June 15, 1783, there was not one prisoner in this city.

In 1778 here was a house of correction. The river ran under it; on side House op were the keeper's apartments; on the other, the warehouse and the room for Correction. the magistrates. * On three sides of a paved court there were thirteen cells for the men, and over them the rooms for the women. On one side of the court were the young women who were put in by their parents or relations; and on the other, the criminals. All the men were employed in spinning cotton, so were some of the women, and the rest in making lace. A pound of cotton at a time was delivered to each; for spinning which, thirteen f were paid.

I found, by the books, that at first coming, some did not earn more than »

seven or eight sous in a week, but soon after they earned from twelve to fourteen. Rye bread (to the value of half a each meal) and water,

was their allowance; and whatever they had more than this, they were required to pay for out of their earnings. They were obliged to put on clean linen every week, towards walking which each paid a The (loves were

heated twice a day, and candles and lamps were provided, at the expence of the magi Urates.

There were three rooms for the ungovernable. One of them had a floor made of triangTilar pieces of wood a few inches asunder. The prisoner was chained in such a manner in the middle of this floor, that he could move but a few steps; and being allowed no shoes, whether he Hood or lay down, he must have been in a very uneasy pollure. — This room therefore was dreaded by the prisoners. The other rooms were abodes so dark and solitary as to be almoll equally dreadful.

The men were never differed to go out, except on Sundays and other holidays, when they went to the chapel, in which they had feats below. The women fat in a gallery with a lattice of wood before them. Here, and also in the prison, a table of regulations was hung up, which was read in public by the chaplain the first Sunday after the entrance of every prisoner. — These regulations confided of thirty-six articles, from which I have taken the following extracts.

" The prisoners must be submissive to the keeper and to his wife; and if they think themselves injured, must complain to the regents. — The times fixed for riling are, at half after fix in the morning from December id to February 15th, and all the rest of the year at five, or half after five; but on Sundays and holidays at fix. — The times of meals are fixed at seven, twelve, and seven. The prisoners are allowed, at their own expence, at breakfast a pint of tea; and at dinner soup or broth, or a pint of tea or small beer, and at supper the same quantity of tea or beer; and on Sundays and other holidays a certain quantity of boiled meat: and every week, a pound of butter, and fruit to the value of half a Jliver.* — Every day the keeper is obliged to prepare two sorts

of soup or broth, and at seven in the morning to give the prisoners their choice of either fort, or none. — After service on Sundays, the men are permitted to walk in the court; and the women in the gallery half an hour, under the in-fpeftion of the keeper and officers. — They forfeit half a , every time they

curse or swear, or make a disturbance in the chapel; and also every time they

are not up in half an hour after they are awakened by the keeper, and for every Antwerp hour they sleep longer. — If they persist in insulting the keeper or his wife after House of admonition, they pay a stiver, and are also punished by having their doors or windows fall closed up. — If they make any noise or disturbance after nine at night to break the rest of their fellow-prisoners, they are ordered to forfeit a Jcalin* and to be punished at the discretion of the regents: who are likewise empowered to make such alterations as they think proper in the rules; and in case of sickness or old age to give indulgences to the prisoners, with respect to their diet, times of rising, &c." In November 1781, the regulations still hung up in the chapel, though the prisoners were removed to

windows do not open, these wards are offensive. The beams and joists are not plastered, as they ought to be. The beds have no tellers; as all have (improperly) in the infirmaries in Holland.

In the Orphan-house the bed-rooms were large, and had opposite windows. Orphan-

The beds were laid on boards highly varnished, on iron bedsteads (five feet house.

eleven inches by three feet seven) and placed in the middle of the rooms, that the windows may be kept open. The bed-rooms and refectories were quite clean.

In the city of Aloft is the gaol for the territory, which includes a hundred Alost. and thirty-seven villages. December 2, 1781, there were in this gaol seven prisoners. Three were confined in a dark room; one, in another room still more horrid; and the remaining three in a strong cagej notwithstanding which, two of these three were loaded with irons. They are never permitted to go out: one said he had been confined fourteen months, and , seven.

Their pale sickly countenances bespoke inhumanity and misery. June 18,

1783, there were four men, and one woman.

In the Rasp-house at Bruges, December 1781, there were fifty-eight men who were Bruces spinning and weaving. Each has his dormitory over the work-rooms. The RAiP-H0USE rooms of the turnkeys are furnished with alarm bells. One of the prisoners had been confined thirty-four years, for an attempt to fet fire to this house; since which the cielings have been arched with brick between the joists. —

This house is under the care of four friars and four sisters. — I asked one of

the friars, how much the prisoners earned ? Pie answered, seven pence a day, but, one with another, no more than about two pence a day."

The hospital in this city is a very spacious and airy room, with a wainscot partition or screen which divides the men from the women. The great attention of the nuns distinguishes the hospitals in Roman catholic countries. Their recluse life gives them a pale look, and is the reason, probably, why the wards of the patients are kept too close; here, however, they look very healthy. There are twenty of them, who rise at four, and are constantly employed about their numerous patients. The di rest refs of the pharmacy last year celebrated her jubilee, or fiftieth year of residence. — These asked, whether I was a catholic. I answered, "I love good people of all religions." Then, said they, "we hope you will die a catholic."

The prison at Ostend, which is near the town-house, consists of nine rooms, but no court. May 27, 1781, there were in it four debtors, and seven criminals} and June 21, 1783, two debtors and four criminals. Eight pence a day is paid to the gaoler for each criminal and insolvent debtor; for which they have one pound and a half of bread, and . an allowance of meat except on meagre days. The gaoler is allowed two pence a day for each, and fifteen pence at entrance, and discharge. The chaplain officiates on Sundays and holidays} he, and the surgeon are paid by the city.

The Tour de S. Pierre at Lille is an old building. There were in it May 24, 1783, three debtors, five smugglers and four vagrants. Five were sick in a very offensive room, with only one bed. Allowance is one pound and

a half of bread. The small and dark dungeons down fifteen steps, I was glad to find unoccupied. — I have abundant reason for thankfulness to divine providence, for recovering me from a fever which I caught of the sick, in this prison, at my last visit. -

At the City -prison there were fourteen prisoners: their allowance consists of bread, butter, and small beer. The dungeons were empty.

The unhealthy countenances of the prisoners at the Citadel shew the pernicious eftefts of lying in cajerns, or damp rooms under the fortifications. May 26, 1783, here were three hundred and forty prisoners, most of them deserters. In the sick-rooms, which were very close and dirty, there were eighty-six; some of whom, though dying, were in irons. The /curvy has

In the General hospital for the poor of both sexes there were about two Hospitals. thousand in May 1783. Those advanced in years are allowed one third of their earnings. There were upwards of three hundred of the girls making lace, for each piece of which they are rewarded with a small donation. Many of the boys, though lodged and boarded here, learn trades in the city; and at twenty years of age, all of both sexes are discharged from the hospital. The girls looked healthy, and their dormitories, infirmaries, and work-rooms were clean. — The internal regulations of this house, and of the infirmary,

(Hotel-Lieu)are very good; but (taking up more than twenty pages) they are too long to be inserted.

The two hospitals La Comteffe and St. Sauveur are lofty buildings, designed

only for the admission of men, for in this city the hospital last described is the only one that takes in women. The patients are distinguished into three classes, viz. wounded — very sick — and recovering. Each class has a separate ward, and every patient a separate bed. When a sick person arrives at either of these hospitals, his bed is immediately shewed him ■, after which one of the fillers brings warm water to him, washes his feet, dries them, and kifies one foot. Another brings clean sheets and a clean towel. A man-servant makes and warms the bed, and the patient goes direct, into it. All the patients are kindly attended by the Nuns, but from prejudices caused by their retired mode of living, some inconveniences arise, such as, neglect of washing the rooms — and opening the windows; in consequence of which, the wards are rendered oflenlive, and very unhealthy, particularly in the night time.

of detaining prisoners for the gaoler's fees: those fees are often paid by a charitable society called the Misericordia. Many from the first families in the kingdom are of this order. They send provisions twice a week to several prisons; and, like the Confraternita della misericordia at Rome, pay great attention to capital convicts. Criminals here are often kept in confinement for several years before they are brought to trial; and sometimes, even after being tried and condemned, they lie in prison some years before they are executed.* I saw some convicts at Lisbon going from prison to embark for the settlements in the Brasils. Such convicts as are designed for India are enrolled as soldiers, and went to a house (or hospital) on the other side of the river, where they are kept some weeks, to bathe, and to be better clothed and fed, that they may be properly prepared for their long voyage.

[Lisbon Prisons.]
---
The great prison at Lisbon, Limoiero, (formerly a palace) is designed for the reception of prisoners from the provinces as well as from the city. There were seven hundred and seventy-four, on Feb. 1783. In one of the lower wards there were seventy criminals, but none in irons. On the first floor there were many who paid for better accommodations, and received no donations from the misericordia. Here civil and criminal causes are tried in a large hall called Caza da Supplicafam, which the prisoners use for a day-room and lodging-room: the courts of justice are opened at eight or nine in the morning. There are two infirmaries, one for each sex: in that for men there were eighteen persons, in single beds with proper bedding: their room looked

towards the river, and was spacious, clean and airy. In the room for the condemned, the beds were in recesses. Over these, in a large gallery latticed, there were beds for the sick from the Jecrete or private chambers. — In this country, and also in Spain,one seldom sees glass windows; but in prisons,

In the prison at the castle, the wards below as well as those in the great

prison, are designed for those that cannot pay; and the first floor for those who pay a stipulated sum. Several small rooms open into a common passage, in some of which (the Jecrete) the prisoners are closely confined. There is no courtyard either to this prison or to that called Limoiero.

* Bepore the Marquis of Pwh&j/'s administration, gaolers used often to let their prisoners out on their parole. One thus favoured, was ordered for execution seven years after he had been condemned. On the gaoler's summons, he immediately returned to the prison from his work in the country. For this punctual regard to his promise he received a pardon.

PORTUGAL. 107

[Lisbon Prisons.]

The ecclesiastical prison (Aljube,) near the great church, is under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch. It consists of four rooms and a small chapel. Here were confined six priests, and three women. In this and the other prisons, the prisoners may be conversed with through iron grates.

In a prison by the rope-walk near the river, many of the nobles and priests were confined in the time of the marquis of Pombal's administration. Here, nineteen vaulted rooms open into a passage: I measured some of them, which were about twenty feet by nine. The wall was six feet two inches thick. In the entrance to each room were three doors, the middle one was an iron grate with round bars. Over each of the doors there was an aperture to admit light, except in two rooms called secrete, which were totally dark.*

[Bellem Prison.]

The prison at Bellem (about two miles from Lisbon) has four rooms below, and several on the first floor for those who pay. Criminals less atrocious than those sent to Limoiero are here confined. The prisoners subsist by charitable donations; and the gaoler told me, that he had a right to a fee from every one discharged.

[Lisbon Arsenal.]

In the Arsenal are four large rooms for the slaves or convicts, most of whom are Moors. Some work at the rope-walk, others fetch water, a few are closely confined, and three or four chained to one spot; one of whom (an Italian) told me he had been thus confined eight years; another, four years. The rest were chained two and two together, and those that went out had a running chain between them, which was taken off as soon as they returned into the arsenal. Their allowance from government was one pound of biscuit a day, and some rice, and half a pound of meat three times a week.† They were employed in carrying water to this prison, the infirmary, and the great prison; and guarded by the military.

[Infirmary.]

The Infirmary for the marines and slaves consisted of two remarkably good rooms, lofty, clean and quiet. The slaves had each a bed with sheets, and great attention was paid to them.

* When the prison of the inquisition was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1755, a few persons saw the rooms of confinement. One gentleman told me, that they open into a long passage, like those at the prison by the rope-walk, but were smaller and under ground.

† In this country the prisoners have a dispensation to eat meat the two first days of Lent (viz. Ash Wednesday and Thursday) so that families may send in to them, the remains of their flesh provisions.

108 APPENDIX.

[Lisbon Castle.]

A manufactory was begun in the Castle about two years ago, for the employment of vagrant and deserted children, in carding, spinning, weaving, making lace, embroidery, &c. About a thousand children were thus employed here. Such an institution may be a great advantage in a country like this, where young people are very much addicted to idleness. But would it not be better, if greater numbers of them were employed in the arts which are most useful and necessary?

[Hospitals.]

The General hospital of S. Joze, (formerly the Jesuits college) has fifteen wards for men and six for women. The number of the former was five hundred and ninety-three; of the latter, two hundred and eighty. Some of the wards were spacious (forty-six feet wide,) and had only two rows of beds, in recesses. These recesses open into a passage two feet nine inches wide. The lower wards, particularly those for the insane, are too close.

The Military hospital of S. Joao de Deos (in which were one hundred and seventy-one patients) was formerly a convent, and not used for an hospital till since the earthquake of 1755. I thought the wards too close.

The English hospital for merchant's seamen, (adjoining to their burying-ground) consists of two or three rooms, in which at my first visit March 3, 1783, were seven patients. The rooms were clean, the victuals good. This hospital has six visitors, each of whom attends two months. The names of the visitors and their months of attendance for this year, I saw hung up in the study of our worthy consul Sir John Hort, by whom this beneficial mode of inspection was first proposed.

The English marine hospital is on the southern side of the Tagus, which is here about two miles over. The hospital has two wards on the ground-floor, in which I found no patients. Eight or ten Danish sailors had lately died here of a malignant fever. In the upper ward were fourteen English men, each of whom had a bed. The side-wall was damp, the ground being ten feet high against it, and all the rooms were very dirty. — This hospital is rented. On many accounts, it should be on the Lisbon side of the river, where every advantage of situation might be chosen. Gentlemen would then undertake the inspection of it; the head surgeon might daily attend; and our seamen here would not be so liable as they are, to be decoyed into foreign service.

In the Misericordia hospital for foundlings, there were between eighty and ninety children, most of them Moors. They looked healthy and clean. Each

[Lisbon.]

nurse had four infants under her care. There is a cradle on the outside which turns on an axis, with a bell to give notice. — Bastardy in this country is attended with little disgrace, children not born in wedlock being allowed to inherit; and this, perhaps, may be the reason why the number of foundlings in this hospital is so inconsiderable.*

[Evora Prison.]

The prisoners at Evora and Elvas subsist by charity. Some of them had been confined three, four, or five years, without being brought to trial.

[Hospital.]

The hospital at Evora had a recess for the bed of each patient; these recesses were lined with glazed tiles. The wards in all the hospitals I saw in this country, were much too close.

Some of the prisons which I visited, had a passage to the street and to the lodging-rooms, secured on both sides by iron grates, at which most of the prisoners were begging.

SPAIN.

[Spain.]

I entered Spain at Badajoz, March 9, 1783. This country abounds with charitable institutions, and there are at present few or no beggars in it.

Most of the prisons have courts for men, with fountains or running water in the centre, and corridors for shade. The same separation of the sexes which I observed in the Portuguese prisons, takes place here; and it is the custom likewise, as in Portugal,for the gaolers to demand fees of prisoners before they are discharged. A condemned criminal, after the judges have made their report, is seldom pardoned by the king. After condemnation, he is called from the other prisoners into the chapel, where his sentence is read to him by a secretary, and a friar attends to exhort and

comfort him, who never leaves him till he is executed. The sentence is generally read on Saturday, and the execution ordered for the Monday following.

When a confession is extorted from a criminal by torture, it is read to him twenty-four hours afterwards, that he may either confirm or retract it. But in some of the provinces this shocking practice does not take place.

It is the custom at Madrid for two of the privy council to visit the prisons; and they often either reverse or alter the sentences of the inferior judges. When I was there, the sentence of one condemned to the Prado prison for eight years, was altered to four months; another sentenced to the same prison for six months, on account of his large family was discharged.

[Asylums.]

Some of the churches in Spain are asylums for debtors and criminals. At Madrid there are only two, S. Sebastian for men, and S. Luis for women. At the former, there were five persons; one of whom said he had been there two years. At the latter, there was only one. A pavement round these churches, about three feet wide, is the verge of the privilege.*

I found more attention paid to prisoners, and the prisons kept cleaner, in the capitals of Portugal and Spain, than in the provinces.

[Badajoz Prisons.]

At Badajoz most of the prisoners in one of the prisons looked unhealthy, and were deserters and smugglers: their allowance of bread was a pound and a half per day. There is a Military hospital belonging to this prison, to which the sick are removed, and in which I saw eleven patients. The entrance to this hospital is by a court; and most of the wards open to an interior court like other Moorish buildings.

There is another prison at Badajoz. The prisoners were begging at the grates; for they subsist partly by alms, and partly by selling purses, which they make in the prison.

* Dr. Moore, in his View of Society and Manners in Italy, judiciously observes, that "the asylum which churches and convents offer to criminals, operates against the peace of society, and tends to the encouragement of this shocking custom (stabbing) in two different manners: first, it increases the criminal's hopes of escaping; secondly, it diminishes, in vulgar minds, the idea of the atrocity of the crime. When the populace see a murderer lodged within the sacred walls of a church, protected and fed by men who are revered on account of their profession, and the supposed sanctity of their lives; must not this weaken the horror which mankind naturally have for such a crime, and which it ought to be the aim of every government to augment?" Letter XLIII.

SPAIN. 111

[Talavera Hospitals.]

At Talavera there were three hospitals. In the largest (Cannon's) the two wards were spacious and airy. That for men had eight iron bedsteads, and the other six. Adjoining to the men's ward, there was a neat room and bed for sick decayed ecclesiastics.

[Toledo Prisons.]

At Toledo there are two prisons. In one of these there were only eight prisoners. But in the other, which was the principal prison, there were, March 16, 1783, two hundred and twenty prisoners; most of whom lay under the corridors in a small court: many were loaded with irons, and almost all looked unhealthy. In the two sick rooms on the first floor, several miserable objects were dying in their beds. On my observing to the gaoler, that the prison was crowded, he informed me, that a fortnight before it had been more crowded, a hundred having been then removed to the arsenal at Carthagena (in Murcia.)

In the hospital of S. Juan de Dios there is only one ward, in which there were six beds, each of them placed in a recess, eight feet by six feet three inches.

---

The hospital of S. Juan Baptijla (founded by one of the archbishops) is finely situated at a little distance from the city. It has summer and winter wards for each sex, exactly limilar, except that the wards for summer are more airy: the windows open to the floor. The men's wards are twenty-four feet wide, with two rows of beds in lofty recesses, in each of which is an aperture for

fresh air. The women's wards were clean, the furniture of their beds linen, but not placed, as the beds of the men were, in recesses. Adjoining to the wards there is a spacious corridor for walking.

The principal Prison (La Cartel de Corte) at ', has an elegant front,*

with this inscription, Reynando la Magcjiad de Felipe IV. anno de 1634, con acuerdo del Consejo se fabrico esta Cartel de Corte para comodidad, y seguridad de los presos.

"In the reign of his majesty Philip IV. A. D. 1634, by direction of the " council, this Court Prison was erested for the convenience and security of " prisoners." The number of prisoners, March 1783, was one hundred and forty men and forty women. There are many rooms on the upper floors about fifteen feet by ten, some with stone bedsteads and iron hooks for chaining the prisoners. In some of the rooms there were three or four prisoners, in

Madrid others but one. Here are two courts; one of them, in which were most of the

prisoners, was paved and had arcades on two sides, and a fountain in the middle.* Some of the prisoners had irons on both legs, with a strong bolt between. These lay on barracks in dungeons down twenty-two steps. In one of the dungeons the gaoler has beds, which he lets to those who will pay him a vcllon and half (3fd.) a night. The women were in one large room; none of them in irons. In the infirmary, which was a large and clean room, the men lay fmgle, and were not in irons. — The provisions were good; the bread fine, the allowance exactly one pound per day. The gaoler has the liberty of taking some prisoners into his house, each of whom pays twenty-five dollars for the term of his confinement. He has rooms alio for which fix dollars are paid, besides a real vellon and a half a night for a bed. He can take off the irons of a prisoner, on the payment of two dollars. The courts are held within the prison. The whole prison was clean; and the gaoler, as I was informed by one of my countrymen there confined, whom I frequently visited, is humane and attentive to his prisoners, who all looked healthy.

The city prison (La Cancel de Villa) is like the former, but has only one court. There were in it about one hundred and twenty men and thirty women. The rooms and dungeons were very dirty and offensive; and the walls of one of the torture-rooms was stained with blood. I was sorry to find such traces of this practice among people, in other respects generous and humane.

La Cancel de la Corona is a prison for ecclesiastics. There were in it -five priests, one of whom had his wife with him.

At the gate of the poll-office, there are four or five dungeons where vagrants, beggars, &c. are confined for a few days, till they are fent to San Fernando. There were here five men and two women: their allowance was twelve quartils(nearly four-pence) a day, besides alms received at the

grates from passengers.

The Prado prison, near the public walk of that name, is one long room in which are barrack-bedsteads. Here were upwards of one hundred prisoners: some were chained to the floor, or to the barracks on which they lay; some worked on the roads, bridges, See. Others having been marines, were to be fent to the docks. They are divided into three classes. To those who

work on the roads, &c. the allowance is seventeen (five pence); to

marines, fourteen; and to those in irons, who do not work, twelve quartils.

I saw about fifty at work out of the-city gates, and asked some of them, which they preferred; working, or confinement ? They readily replied, the former; but added, that they were not forced to work hard. I observed that the guard, with them and at the prison, were calm and Jleady.

San Fernando, about eight miles from the city, is a house of correction for

petty offenders, vagrants, and beggars. Here were three hundred and nine men and five hundred and forty-seven women. Some were carrying stone to a lime-kiln; some making and washing the linen of the house; and some were spinning linen and worsted. The work-rooms were thirty-two feet wide} the infirmaries were spacious, at the top of the house. The prisoners were clothed in an uniform, and each was allowed t\\ft> pair of shoes and dockings. The men's apartments were clean, but the women's (as is generally the case in the Spanish prisons and hospitals) were much cleaner. Every one had a bed, a mattress and two coverlets. The women here have a court as well as the men; and both courts are commanded by the keeper's balcony. The provisions were good: the bread allowance is twenty ounces a day. Two of the prisoners attend at dinner, to see that each is served with his full ‘portion of soup (three quarters of a pint). They are allowed three feasts in a year, Christmas, Easter, and San Fernando's day. Here is a shop for the sale of wine, the quality and price of which are fixed by the magistrates } but no spirituous liquors are permitted to be fold. No fees are paid at entrance, or discharge. The prison is attended by a physician, a surgeon and a chaplain: it has also a guard, consisting of thirty foot and eight horse, which is changed every month. I must add, that the keeper seemed to be humane and attentive.*

The Hospicio, a sort of prison, is also a well-regulated manufactory, in which the sexes are intirely separated. A considerable number of men, advanced in years, were picking wool. In one room, an hundred and fifty boys were spin-ning worded; in another, sixty were carding wool. Forty or fifty looms were employed on coarse linen others on wide cloth. In two rooms I observed (locking and waistcoat frames. Some boys were carding and spinning the down of hares and rabbits for gloves; and some were employed in a pin manufactory. A number of tailors and carpenters I also faw at work. Fifty of the lead boys were under instruction in the school. All commonly rife at fix; attend prayers, and then go to breakfast; dine about noon; and fup at sunset. They have twenty-two ounces of bread, and two ounces of pease a day, and half a pound of meat, except on meager days. There are two rooms for the confinement of the disorderly. — The regulations are the same with those for San Fernando.

The Real Hospital General,is a new building round a spacious court (three

hundred and ten feet by two hundred) in which are two reservoirs of water. Three sides of the court have corridors, twelve feet wide. The great wards (fifty-five feet and a half wide) divided by a wall having several openings, are furnished with double rows of beds on iron bedsteads (six feet three inches by three feet two) one for each patient, and a marble flab is placed against the wall for every two beds. The rooms are arched over, and have many apertures in the cieling, but all the windows were shut. At one end of each ward is an altar, at the other a fire-place. The number of men, as appeared by a lift that was given me, was five hundred and eighty-nine. A multitude of visitors rendered the wards dirty and noisy. The staircases are light and airy; the steps are of stone, sixteen inches wide; and the ascent (four inches) easy.

The number of women was three hundred and two. Their apartments in the new hospital being not yet built, they were lodged in the old wards, which are much cleaner than the men's. In this hospital, and at one or two in Portugal, convalescents are put into the clofcft and worst rooms.

Here is a detached ward, for prisoners, furnished with twenty-eight beds, and well guarded. Here are likewise rooms (carefully separated) for insane, for dropsical; and for consumptive patients. The contagion of consumptions is supposed to infedt not only the clothes, bedding, and furniture of rooms,

but also the walls and cieling. Danger has been apprehended even from the horses of consumptive patients; and for this reason it was thought necessary, in an instance that was mentioned to me, to kill the horse of an officer who had died of this distemper.. — Besides one principal physician, there are eighteen others, who attend their stated wards, fix surgeons with two hundred assistants (praticantes) and twenty-three priests, who all lodge and board in the hospital.

The hospital of S. Juan de Dios is chiefly appropriated to venereal patients. Here were one hundred and seventy-three men and twenty-eight women. The wards for the men are upstairs; the women's apartment is on the ground-floor, and has an aperture in it so contrived, as that their friends may converse with them without seeing them. The wards of both sexes were cleaner and quieter than those of the general hospital.

In the convent De la Latina there are two rooms for sick men, one for summer, the other for winter, with beds in recefies.

In the convent (or hospital) of San Fra there are two wards, one with seven beds for men, the other with eight for women. At the time of my visit, they were serving the afternoon chocolate. — In the hospitals that are in convents, the rooms are much cleaner and quieter, and more attention is paid to the patients, than in other hospitals.

Here is a charitable foundation for eight widows, of officers who died in the late war.

There are at Madrid two other hospitals which may well deserve to be mentioned; one, called the hospital de la; the other, the hospital of San Antonio.

The hospital de la Corte for the king's servants, is built in the form of a

cross. It has an altar in the centre, under a cupola. The wards are vaulted and lofty. The walls are lined (five feet high) with glazed tiles. In the walls there are convenient alcoves (three feet nine inches wide, and five feet and a half high) with linen curtains before them. The beds in this hospital are not in recefies. The patients have chocolate and biscuit for breakfast, and in the afternoon.

The hospital of San Antonio is intended chiefly for the reception and accommodation of poor travelling Austrians, for three days. In one room there are four beds for men; in another, three for women. Here is also a refectory. The allowance to each traveller is two pounds of bread, one pound of mutton, and a quarter of a pound of lard a day. In the two rooms for the sick, the regulations for the physician, surgeon, and patients, are hung up.

In a room in this hospital a charitable society, called the Hermandad del refugio, meet every evening, and then go about the streets, giving notice of their presence by striking the pavement with flicks shod with iron. Whatever poor and distressed people they meet with in this perambulation, they conduct to this hospital, and supply them with a supper of bread and . eggs, one night's lodging (in rooms which are appropriated for them), and a breakfast of bread and raisins.* The sick they send to the general hospital, where one of the eighteen physicians already mentioned, always attends to examine and

admit patients. — In that part of this hospital which is next the street, there is a place into which the sick put notices of their distress, in consequence of which they are immediately visited and relieved by the society.

In the city of Valladolid there are four courts, the chancery, the city, the bishop's court, and the inquisition, each of which has a prison belonging to it: but in the bishop's prison, of late, there have been few or no prisoners.

Most of the prisoners in the Chancery or Province prison lie on a bench in a long room: it has no dungeons. In the chapel is a (lone bedstead for the condemned. April 4, 1783, there were one hundred and twenty-eight men and thirteen women.

In the City prison also most of the prisoners were crowded together into one long room. This prison did not want dungeons. I passed through two, into a dark and damp and dismal one, in which I saw a poor creature lying on his back chained by both legs to a great stone. — Prisoners here are confined for a long time before they are brought to trial. — Fees are demanded as at Madrid. — The prison allowance is one real. About thirty convicts were to be fent the following week to Ferrol, they are allowed two reals a day. The prisoners are not permitted to shew themselves at the grates of the prison; and the same is true of the two principal prisons at Madrid. — Not long since, one who was put to the torture here, denied the crime for which he was tortured, but confessed another (a murder) and was executed for it.

I failed in my attempt to gain admittance into the inquisition at Lifhon. At Madrid, by the kind assistance of Count Campomanes, I got access to the inquisitor-general, but the day on which I applied to him being a great holiday, he appointed me seven o'clock the next morning. On this holiday I saw the inquisitor, several of the nobility and others, go in procession to church, carrying the insignia of the order, which are a cross between a palm and a sword. The next morning, the inquisitor received me at prayers, and in a few minutes conduced me to the tribunal, which was hung with red: over the inquisitor's feat there was a crucifix, and before it a table with feats for the two secretaries, and a stool for the prisoner. I could not prevail on him to shew me any other part of the prison; but he told me that he went

The letters of the same kind friend. Count procured my admission at Valladolid. I was received at the inquisition-prison by the two in-quifitors, their secretaries, and two magistrates, and conducted into several rooms. On the side of one room was the picture of an Auto de Fe in 1667, when ninety-seven persons were burnt :* at this time the Spanish court resided at Valladolid. The tribunal room is like that at , but has an altar, and

a door (with three locks) into the secretary's room, over which was inscribed the words of the greater excommunication denounced against all strangers who presume to enter. In two other tribunal rooms, there were the insignia of the inquisition. In a large room I saw on the floor and shelves, many prohibited books, feme of which were English: in another room, I saw multitudes of crofies, beads, and small pictures. The painted cap was also shewed me, and the vestments for the unhappy victims. After several consultations, I was permitted to go up the private staircase, by which prisoners are brought to the tribunal; this leads to a passage with several doors in it, which I was not permitted to enter. On one of the secretaries telling me, " none but prisoners ever enter these rooms;" I answered, I would be confined for a month to satisfy my curiosity; he replied, "none come out under three years." I learned, by walking in the court, and conversing with the inquisitors, that the cells have double doors, and are separated by two walls, to prevent prisoners conversing together, and that over the space between the walls there is a fort of chimney or funnel, enclosed at the top, but having perforations on the sides, through which some air and a glimmering of light enter. These funnels, the inquisitors told me, are double barred: and one of them serves two cells. . The passages into which the cells open, have small apertures for the admission of light. — In a gloomy area at the back of the prison, there was nothing but a great mafiiff dog.

It is well known that from this court there is no appeal. — I need not fay how horrid the secrecy and severity of it appear. I could not but observe, that even the fight of it struck terror into the common people as they passed. It is styled, by a monltrous abuse of words, the holy and apofiolic court of inquisition.

The prison at Burgosy (built, as appears by an inscription on the front in 1778) surrounds a court forty feet square, in which is a fountain, and a stone trough. The cells are fourteen feet by nine and a half. They have two doors, the inner one lattice. The number of prisoners April 8, 1783, was one hundred and forty-five men and seven women. The women, as in other gaols

in this country, are always locked up. In the men's infirmary there were nineteen beds in recedes, but only fix patients. The architedl has been attentive to the construction of drains and sewers, for though this gaol was very dirty, it was not offensive. In this, as in other prisons, there are

(locks for the punishment of offences committed within the prison. — No rules and orders are hung up. — Here is no torture-room.

The Hospicio Hands near the river, and consists of a house of correction, an hospital for foundlings, and a chapel. It has two courts, one for men and the other for women, in the former of which there is a water-mill for grinding corn. Two rooms with beds in recedes are appropriated to the sick. Four

nurses are always present, to take care of the infants that are brought in, till

they can be fent to be nursed in the country. The bread is good and made in the house. The allowance to each person one pound and a half.

The disorderly are punished by being confined in a dark room: a woman in one of these rooms requested, with tears, my inter for her. I applied to the chaplain, who is the superintendent of the house, and he readily consented to release her from her confinement.

The Hospital del Rey at the convent of the , about two miles from the

city, has two spacious wards for each sex, that the chirurgical patients may be separated from the others. These wards were very clean, and the beds placed in recedes (ten feet by nine feet four inches) with curtains before those for the women. The other three hospitals at Burgos resemble this noble hospital: and have small botanic gardens belonging to them.

The ptifonat Pamplona is an old building in the middle of the city. It has

three small courts: the prisoners lie in boxes without mattresses or bedding. There were flocks, and also a dark vaulted room for the punishment of offences committed in the prison. The rooms being dirty and offensive, I inquired whether epidemical distempers had not sometimes prevailed there, and was answered in the affirmative, and told that about eight years ago,

eighteen or twenty prisoners had died in a short time. Here were sixty-one men and three women April 15, 1783. Allowance to each is about two pence a day.

The upper floor of this prison is used as a house of for women.

I saw twenty-eight in four rooms, all spinning, but not with wheels. Each had a bed: the rooms were clean. The bread was good; allowance one pound and a half a day. The term of confinement, from four years to eight; but if any person should choose to marry one confined for small offences, the magistrates are ready to release her. — -One of the magistrates told me that he visited this prison every week, to hear any complaints that might be made. I inquired, whether the keeper went with him; he replied, that he did.

The torture is not used in this province (Navarre). A singular custom prevails here ■, for twice in the year (the day before , and eight days

before Easter), the Viceroy goes with the magistrates to the council-chamber in the prison, and releases whom he pleases of the prisoners. The day before I got to Pamplona, he had relreased thirteen. A few years ago, to the surprise of the magistrates, all were released.

Two, of the four churches in this city, are asylums for debtors and criminals, at one of which (the cathedral) there was one criminal.

In the Citadel there were one hundred and twenty slaves (or convicts) crowded into five or six rooms. Those in the upper, rooms had only a ring on one leg. Those in the lower rooms, about thirty in number, very sickly, were chained two and two with heavy chains, and some for very flight offences. The rooms had barracks, but no bedding. There is the same allowance to all, one pound and a half of brown bread and about five farthings each in money. A loaf, weighing exactly three pounds, is given to every soldier every other day; but for the prisoners, it is divided, and one half given them every day, to prevent them from selling it. — Those who have only a ring, find fecurities for not escaping, and sometimes are employed in the houses in the citadel, and paid for their labour. If they escape, their securities are obliged to put on the chain and to take their places. If they are retaken, their term is doubled.

Some for more atrocious crimes are fent to *, and others to the African settlements.

Misericordia

Here is a large building called the Misericordia similar to the hospicio in Pamplona Madrid, in which are confined beggars, vagrants, and refractory children.

Workmen also are here employed, and apprentices taken, to carry on a manufactory of coarse cloth.

Near the Misericordia there is an hospital for orphans or children of the Hospital poor (los ninos de la doRrina). They are taught to read and work, and the F011 boys serve in the churches. Their number was forty-five boys and thirteen PHAN5' girls. This house is in part supported by the contributions of those who play at ball, in a building erected by the city for that diversion, which is here a favourite one.*

At the great Hospital I found the men's wards very dirty,j- but the women's Hospital clean. There is a distinct ward for chirurgical patients, and also wards for sick prisoners. I observed, that the same attention was paid to them, as to the

other patients, for I twice attended one of the physicians through the wards.

All the patients lie single; and this salutary practice is general in the Spanish hospitals. Near the women's ward, nine or ten infants lay bound hands and feet in a smoky kitchen. In a spacious room just by, the governess lodged.

On my mentioning to the physician before her, that the infants should be in that room and not in the kitchen; she said it was too cold for them. I replied, the true reason was, that she thought they would disturb her rest. J

* At Madrid also, a part of the money collected at the play-house and at the bull-feasts, is appropriated to the support of the hospitals.

f The floors of most hospitals in Spain, are laid with a soft and bad brick, and they are sometimes sprinkled but never washed. In the men's wards no women attend. What renders the wards in general so close and offensive as they are, is the practice of continually taking snuff and spitting; together with an universal prejudice which prevails in this country, (though so hot a country,) against the free admission of air, and walking of rooms. The cullom of walking the feet and hands of patients before they are put to bed, which I have observed in some hospitals, is not known here. I am persuaded, however, that such a custom, with air and cleanliness, and an abstemious diet, are of more importance in hospitals than any administration of physik.

Amiens Prisons.

At Amiens are two prisons; one for Bourgeois et La, the other, La Conciergerie. — In the town-house I saw great numbers attending the

trial of a woman for confining her fon. He was then about thirty-two years of age, and had been confined sixteen years, with a severity which had almost deprived him of his intellects. The prosecution was carried on by his father's relations, who had been long solicitous for his release.

[Paris.]

At Paris,in 1783, I found two of the word of the prisons,

risons. and For-l'eveque, with their horrid dungeons, entirely demolished. The

debtors now are fent to a new prison, the Hotel de la Force; and criminals are fent to the Conciergerie, or the Grand Chatelet. The king's declaration for this alteration, dated August 30, 1780, contains some of the most humane and enlightened sentiments respecting the conduct of prisons. It mentions the con-struction of airy and spacious infirmaries for the sick; separate places of confinement, and courts, for men and women, and for prisoners of different classes; and a total abolition of underground dungeons, upon this principle, that it is unjust, that those who may possibly be innocent, should beforehand suffer a

Concier- The Conciergerie has an airy court (fifty-five yards by thirty-eight) with a CERIE‘ fine piazza. The dungeons are dark and offensive. There is a new infirmary, with beds admitting only one patient in each. At my former visits here was a tap-room, which now, to the honour of the police, is abolished. At several visits in 1783 the prisoners were calm and quiet.*

L'Abbaye is a prison for the military or guards, and for such debtors as are men of rank. In the debtors rooms a partition of lath and plaster, detached from the brick-wall, answers the end of an expedient to prevent escapes: for if the smallest perforation be made in the partition, it is immediately discovered, by the mortar falling between that and the wall into the keeper's court, through the aperture which is left for that purpose. Here are fix small dungeons, in which, as the gaoler said, there were sometimes fifty confined.

The Hotel de la Force (a new prison for debtors, vagrants, deserters and petty offenders) has been occupied only from January* 1782. It is an airy and spacious building, and has several courts and areas for the separation'of men, and women, and the different kinds of prisoners. The courts are all clean and well supplied with water. The number of debtors was seventy-eight men and eleven women. Over the doors are painted the price to be paid for the beds from five to thirty sous a night. There are also rooms and beds for debtors that cannot pay: each of the prisoners that are poor have one pound and a half of bread and soup every day.

Here are two chapels, an airy infirmary, for each sex; and a well furnished apothecary's shop, from which this, and the other prisons are supplied with drugs. There are fourteen turnkeys, twelve every day on duty in separate departments; but in case of any riot or disorder they can readily assist one

another: two walk in each of the men's courts. — By the lift fent into the office of the police, May 17, 1783, the number of prisoners of all descriptions was two hundred and seventy-one, of whom many were deserters.

An Arret of parliament for the regulation of this prison, containing twenty-nine articles,* is ordered to be read in the chapels before all the prisoners on the first Sunday of every month, and to be fixed on the doors of the chapels, and on several other conspicuous parts of the prison.

The prison of Saint Martin is for loose women, who are seldom confined here for more than fourteen days. Here are fix rooms for those that pay six livres a month for their beds, and four rooms for those that lie on straw. On the upper floor there are three rooms (called Jecrete) for the punishment of the refractory. The court is small. At my last visit there were one hundred and fifteen prisoners, so that the rooms were crowded.

The prison of Saint-Eloi} intended for women, is situated in a very close part of the city. Here were thirty-eight prisoners; some of whom had been confined three or four years. All were troubled with a cutaneous disorder, and some to a very great degree. Each has one pound and a half of bread a day, and (from a charity) soup four days in a week.

At the Hotel de ville there are two rooms, in which were two men and a woman.

In this country, when prisoners have received their liberty from the king, or their creditors, they cannot be detained a moment for fees, hire of rooms, debts contracted in prison, or on any pretence whatever.

The nomination of a gaoler belongs to the magistrates. When he has been nominated, he is proposed to the Procure; and if, after a careful inquiry into his character, it appears that he has the reputation of a man of probity, he is fixed in the office, and takes an oath of fidelity. The office is freely given him without any expence whatever.

* Most of the articles of this Arret are similar to those of the Arret of 1717 mentioned page 150; but the eleventh article being new, I will copy it. " Let prisonniers a

aucun droit d'entree ni de fortit de la prison." i. e. Prisoners shall pay no fee at coming in or going out of the prison.

FRANCE. 125

[Paris.]

A prisoner of rank, a very sensible man, to whom I was speaking in one of my former visits concerning gaolers, said, "They pay nothing to the crown, and their revenue is not small; at the Conciergerie, it is about fifteen thousand livres; at the Grand Chatelet, twenty thousand; at Fort L'eveque, twenty thousand; at the Petit Chatelet, twelve thousand; at L'Abbaye, ten thousand. And all things considered," he added, "prisoners have no just reason to complain of this class of men in France."

[Bicetre.]

In 1778 I was two mornings at the Bicétre, where I saw in the two halls above two hundred prisoners. Such a number confined together in idleness, must produce a great corruption of manners. Many at their unhappy end have ascribed their ruin to the flagitious examples they have here seen, and the instructions here given them.

There were sixty-three in the infirmary, most of them ill of the scorbut. They contracted this distemper in a year or two from their confinement, which was extremely close, as they were never suffered to go out of their rooms. Many lost the use of their limbs by it. I saw several such miserable objects at St. Louis's hospital, where they are often admitted at the expiration of their term at the Bicétre.

The French are now sensible of the bad police of confining persons in idleness; for of late they have here set their prisoners to work. I saw in 1783 one hundred and twenty employed in three rooms, in polishing, &c. plate glass. The water formerly drawn by horses, is now drawn by seventy-two prisoners in three sets, each set working one hour at a time, and five hours in a day. They draw every day about two hundred and forty buckets, and are paid for each bucket two sous and a half. The prisoners are much healthier than they were at my former visits.

[Salpetriere.]

The great hospital, or Salpêtriere, near the city, is for women and girls. Their number is upwards of five thousand. Many of the girls are employed on the finest embroidery. Here are numbers of poor and insane; and a sisterhood of religieuse reside in the house. The criminals are quite separate from the others, and seldom seen by strangers: there are but few of these employed. — At my last visit there were eight hundred and twenty confined, most of them by their parents or relations: their lodging-rooms are six feet ten inches by five feet seven. There are three infirmaries; in two of them

[Paris.]

the patients lay in single beds, but the other (for criminals) was crowded, and had three in a bed. The whole house was kept clean and quiet by the great attention of the good sisters.

[La Tournelle.]

Near the gate of St. Bernard is the prison La Tournelle for those who are condemned to the galleys: at my visit in 1778 there were only fifteen prisoners, who were chained two and two together. In 1783, there were ninety-three. Their daily allowance is one pound and a half of good bread, and half a pound of meat, and soup. On meager days they are allowed pease in their soup. On their journey they have two pounds of bread, half a pound of meat, a pint of wine, and about a quarter of a pound of cheese, or eggs. — They are sent from hence to Marseilles, Toulon, Brest, &c. on the 25th of May and the 10th of September, and are joined by many other convicts from the provinces. I was informed that in May 1778, one hundred and sixty-three went off from this prison.

[Hospitals.]

The hospitals of Saint-Louis and the Hôtel-Dieu for the sick, are indeed the two worst hospitals that I ever visited. They were so crowded, that formerly I have often seen five or six in one bed, some of them dying.

[Hôtel-Dieu.]

The Hôtel-Dieu is situated in the closest part of the city.* The new wards are too low. In 1783, the hospital was cleaner than at my former visits, but in the great ward (St. Charles) and in the women's wards, many of the patients were two or three in a bed.†

[Saint-Louis.]

The hospital of Saint-Louis stands out of the city. There is a considerable ascent to the wards, and there is no floor over them. The wards were dirty and noisy, and in many of the beds there were three patients. — According to the lists I procured at my visits in 1783, the number of patients was,

* One cannot but wish, that after the fire in the Hôtel-Dieu a few years since, the hospital had been removed to a more airy situation.

† Over one of the gates of the Hôtel-Dieu is the following inscription, which, from its application to such a place, has an air of ridicule and even of profaneness.

"C'est icy la Maison de Dieu, et la Porte du Ciel."

Though these two hospitals are a disgrace to Paris, it has many other charitable foundations which do honour to it; and from which this country may derive useful information.
---
[La Charite.]

The hospital of La Charite for men, is one of the bed in Paris. There are now two hundred and three beds, and another ward is nearly finished, twenty-six feet and a half wide. All the patients lie single; the furniture of their beds is green, and they wear a uniform of the same colour. Here is lately made a convenient walk for the patients. The presentation of beds is bought, and descends to heirs; the price for a bed is twelve thousand , as I was

informed by one of the fathers. The beds are always occupied; except three or four which are reserved, that immediate attention may be always paid to a patron's presentation. This hospital does honour to the order of St. Jean de Lieu: the chambers of the friars are over the wards, which I think improper, because it may occasion the windows of the wards to be too often shut.

This fraternity has also the charge of the hospital for which consists of a hall with a brick-floor containing twenty-one beds. Adjoining is a refectory, where the patients (who continue here only eight days) have four meals a day, viz.at fix, nine, twelve and a half and five o'clock. They are allowed meat and wine every day in the year, Good-Friday excepted. I wish the French physicians were convinced of the necessity of (not sprinkling) the wards.

Des Petites Maisons.

The hospital des petites-Maisons is situated in a spacious garden or court, containing a number of small houses for the aged and infirm of both sexes, and single rooms for the insane. Here are also fix rooms for the sick, in which are *

* Mr learned friend Dr. Price will be pleased to find some alteration for the better in the Hôtel-Dieu, for the number that died in 1782 was considerably under a fifth of those that were admitted. See his Rmerfionary Payments, vol. I. p. 296. 4th edit.

[Paris Des Petites Maisons.]

a hundred and thirteen beds; a new room for forty beds is not yet occupied. The good sisters kindly attend. The neatness and cleanliness I observed here engaged me often to repeat my visits. Rooms in the hospital and beds in the sick wards are bought by the opulent, as asylums for aged domestics and poor friends.

[Madame Necker's Hospital.]

Madame Necker's hospital is a noble example of private charity. It has beds for seventy men and sixty women, who are attended by fourteen of the sisters. The medical and chirurgical patients are separated. I advised washing the men's wards; but my advice has not been taken.

[Des Incurables.]

In the hospital for Incurables there are about four hundred persons, most of them aged and infirm, and clothed in a neat uniform; the men in gray, the women in black. Each has a bed, two chairs, a table and a cupboard. The furniture is changed twice in a year; in winter it is green woollen, in summer white linen. The rooms on the ground-floor open (very properly) into a spacious and pleasant garden. The provisions were good, and served by the sisters, forty of whom have the care of this hospital. A presentation here, formerly bought for ten thousand five hundred livres, is now raised to twelve thousand.

[Quinze-vingts Hospital.]

The Quinze-vingts hospital was founded in 1260 for the accommodation of three hundred blind persons. Formerly they used to beg in the churches for subsistence; but lately, in consequence of the attention of Cardinal Rohan, and an increase of the rents, an income sufficient for supporting them has been obtained, and is now settled on them by an Arrêt of March 14, 1783. They are divided into three classes; single persons, who have twenty sous a day — married, twenty-six — and those who have been married twenty-two or twenty-three years, thirty-six sous: these allowances are paid every month. Each person has three pounds of salt given him thrice in the year. Wood for firing is also given to the most necessitous. The parents of children are allowed two sous a day for every child under sixteen; besides a sum to put out their children to apprenticeships. Every indulgence is granted of walking out, visiting friends, &c. Several who have families increase the means of their subsistence by keeping little shops. There were fifty-two of the third class at my visit in 1783. — The regulations are hung up on the walls in several places. There are two rooms for confining the disorderly.

[Plate.]

FRANCE. 129

[Paris Quinze-vingts Hospital.]

An infirmary is designed, and Oculifts are to be appointed, who, besides attending the infirmary, are to attend twice in the week to give advice to others who may apply to them: an annual sum is likewise to be offered for the best dissertation on disorders of the eyes. This hospital is a privileged place; and a chapel belongs to it in which divine service is constantly performed.

[Foundling Hospital.]

At the Foundling-hospital near the Hôtel-Dieu, the infants lie in neat cradles

with white furniture. May 21, 1783, there were here only fifty, the reason of which is, that they are sent into the country soon after they are received. They remain in the country five or six years, and when they are brought back, most of the girls are placed at Salpêtriere, and the rest with the boys in the suburb of St. Antoine, in which last place there were at this time four hundred and fifty boys and girls. I learnt from the lists which are made out every month, that the whole number of foundlings on this foundation on the first of May, 1783, was thirteen thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven.

[Bastille.]

In my tour in 1778 I had the good fortune to procure an extremely scarce pamphlet, published in 1774, written by a person who had long been confined in the Bastille. It is reckoned the best account of this celebrated structure ever published; and the sale of it being prohibited in France, under very severe penalties, it is become extremely scarce. I have extracted the most material circumstances of the description, and have caused the plate to be copied from that in the work.

"This castle is a state prison, consisting of eight very strong towers, surrounded with a fossé about one hundred and twenty feet wide, and a wall sixty feet high. The entrance is at the end of the street of St. Antoine, by a drawbridge, and great gates into the court of l'Hôtel du Gouvernement, and from thence over another draw-bridge to the corps de garde, which is separated by a strong barrier constructed with beams plated with iron, from the great court. This court is about one hundred and twenty feet by eighty. In it is a fountain; and six of the towers surround it, which are united by walls of free-stone ten feet thick up to the top. At the bottom of this court is a large modern corps de logis, which separates it from the court du Puits. This court is fifty feet by twenty-five. Contiguous to it, are the other two towers. On the top of the towers is a platform continued in terraces, on which the prisoners are sometimes permitted to walk, attended by a guard. On this platform are

130 APPENDIX.

[Bastille.]

thirteen cannons mounted, which are discharged on days of rejoicing. In the corps de logis is the council-chamber, and the kitchen, offices, &c. above these are rooms for prisoners of distinction, and over the council-chamber the king's lieutenant resides. In the court du Puits is a large well for the use of the kitchen.

"The dungeons of the tower de la Liberté extend under the kitchen, &c. Near that tower is a small chapel on the ground-floor. In the wall of it are five nitches or closets, in which prisoners are put one by one to hear mass, where they can neither see nor be seen.

"The dungeons at the bottom of the towers exhale the most offensive scents, and are the receptacles of toads, rats, and other kinds of vermin. In the corner of each is a camp-bed, made of planks laid on iron bars that are fixed to the walls, and the prisoners are allowed some straw to lay on the beds. These dens are dark, having no windows, but openings into the ditch: they have double doors, the inner ones plated with iron, with large bolts and locks.

"Of the five classes of chambers, the most horrid next to the dungeons are those in which are cages of iron. There are three of them. They are formed of beams with strong plates of iron, and are each eight feet by six.

"The Calottes, chambers at the top of the towers, are somewhat more tolerable. They are formed of eight arcades of free-stone. Here one cannot walk but in the middle of the room. There is hardly sufficient space for a bed from one arcade to another. The windows, being in walls ten feet thick, and having iron grates within and without, admit but little light. In these rooms the heat is excessive in summer, and the cold in winter. They have stoves.

"Almost all the other rooms (of the towers) are octagons, about twenty feet in diameter, and from fourteen to fifteen high. They are very cold and damp. Each is furnished with a bed of green serge, &c. All the chambers are numbered. The prisoners are called by the name of their tower joined to the number of their room.

"A surgeon and three chaplains reside in the castle. If prisoners of note are dangerously ill, they are generally removed, that they may not die in this prison.- — The prisoners who die there are buried in the parish of St. Paul, under the name of domestics.

"A library was founded by a prisoner who was a foreigner, and died in the Bastille the beginning of the present century. Some prisoners obtain permission to have the use of it.

[Plate.]

FRANCE. 131

[Bastille.]

"One of the centinels on the inside of the castle rings a bell every hour, day and night, to give notice that they are awake: and on the rounds on the outside of the cattle they ring every quarter of an hour."

In inserting so particular an account of this place, my principal intention is to excite in my readers a strong detestation of despotism, and a love for the laws which are the foundation of our liberty.*

[Bordeaux Prisons.]

At the town-house in Bordeaux, April 27, 1783, there were in three rooms down twenty-seven steps fifteen prisoners in irons, who told me they were never out. In two rooms down thirty-one steps there were ten men, and in another room a woman. On the ground-floor there were many confined for slight offences.

In the Palais (the prison for the province) the men were in the court. The windows of the women's two rooms were (improperly) toward the street.

[House of Correction.]

The house of correction (Maison de Force) is in a convent. The rooms were neat and clean. There were twenty-four women at needle-work, who put on their veils when I entered the hall.

[Hospitals.]

The great hospital is in a close part of the city. The wards for men are on the first floor round a quadrangle. The women have three wards on the ground-floor, one for medical patients; one for chirurgical the other for those that are very ill. In many of the wards there were two in a bed. This hospital is kept clean, as it is under the care of the religieuses; who have also the charge of the foundling-hospital which is a spacious building near the river.

[Lyons.]

At Madrid I found a plate of the hospital at Lyons† which I here insert.

* Sir William Blackstone observes, that the preservation of personal liberty is of great importance to the public: "for if once it were left in the power of any, the highest, magistrate to imprison arbitrarily whomever he or his officers thought proper, (as in France it is daily practised by the crown‖) there would soon be an end of all other rights and immunities."

‖ "I have been assured upon good authority, that, during the mild administration of cardinal Fleury, above 54,000 lettres de cachet were issued, upon the single ground of the famous bulle unigenitus."

132 APPENDIX.

[St. Omer's.]

At La Prison Royale, or the new prison, at St. Omer's, the daily allowance is a pound and a half of bread, and soup. The prisoners have clean linen every week, which is the only reason why I mention this prison.

[Dunkirk Prison.]

In the prison at Dunkirk, the French prisoners were in two or three rooms by themselves.

[English Prisoners.]

Here (January 1779) I found many of my countrymen prisoners of war. In five rooms there were a hundred and thirty-three — captains, mates, passengers and common sailors all crowded together — who lay on straw with one coverlet for every three persons. In three other rooms there were thirteen accommodated in a better manner, because most of them were ransomers,* and capable of paying six sous a night for their beds. The court was small, being only forty-two feet by twenty-six; nor was there sufficient plenty of water. The bread, beer, and soup were good, and the beef tolerable.† Each room was supplied with two small faggots a day for firing. The sick (of whom there were only three) were taken to the military hospital, and great attention was paid to them. The regulations were hung up in English‡ and French.

* A ransomer is a person confined as a security, till the sum is paid for which a ship has been ransomed.

† In a former war, the contract here was twelve sous a man; in the last it was fifteen.

‡ BY THE KING.

RULES to be observed by all Prisoners of War in the Kingdom of France.

Article I. THE orders given by the commissary of the marines encharged with the care of the prisoners are to be strictly complied with unargued and undisputed. None of the prisoners shall insult, threaten or abuse, much less strike the turnkey, nor any of those appointed to do business in the prison, under the penalty of incurring such punishment as shall be ordered by the commissary of the marines, and of losing turn of being exchanged; nay further they shall be close confined and deprived of one half of their food or pittance.

Art. II. All and every prisoner, when the commissary makes review, shall answer to their name or names, and if in the list delivered to the commissary there be found any error, they shall point it out, that it may be rectified, in order to prevent the confusion that might result from mistaking of names.

Art. III. All prisoners that shall refuse to answer to their names at the review, shall be punished by being deprived of their food till such time as they shall submit to the call.

FRANCE. 133

[Bergues.]

[English Prisoners.]

In the prison at Bergues I found forty-seven English prisoners. The table of victualling was hung up here as at Dunkirk, but the provisions were not so good. There were twelve on their parole in this town, nine at Bourbourg, and two at Ardres, who told me they had procured bondsmen for their security.

Art. IV. If there happen any damage to the place where the prisoners are kept, whether it be with intent to make an escape, or otherwise, purposely and wilfully committed, the expense for repairing such damage shall be paid out of the food of those that are found guilty of the infringement; and if there be no means of discovering the guilty persons, all the prisoners shall contribute an equal share out of their food to the charges of such repair.

Art. V. Whoever after escape from his prison is retaken, shall be shut in a dungeon, and shall be stinted to half his pittance of food, till he has by this confinement satisfied for the expenses made for seizing and bringing him back to gaol, and shall lose his turn of exchange besides. A sea-officer thus contravening, shall from that moment be looked upon and treated as a common sailor.

Art. VI. It is forbidden to fight, quarrel, or make any riot in the prisons or places where the prisoners are allowed to take the air, under pain of incurring such punishment as the offence may require.

Art. VII. The prisons shall be kept clean and neat by the sailors, every man in his turn, as shall be regulated, and whatever sailor shall refuse this service in his turn, his food shall be withheld from him till he submit to it.

Art. VIII. The prisoners are to inform the commissary of the clothes or other necessaries they may want, and can pay for, and the commissary shall not only allow them to be provided with such things, but shall also take care they be not imposed upon in the price.

Art. IX. In every prison the prisoners may appoint three or five of themselves, and change them at their pleasure, in order to inspect their victuals and fee if they be good, and if they have their share or portion, whether in weight or measure, according to the following victualling table; and if there arise any reason for complaint, either of dressing, serving them up, or otherwise, they are with decency to apprise the commissary of it, who, finding such complaint well grounded, shall give immediate redress, and do them justice.

Art. X. It shall be allowed to tradesmen or sellers of ware (except such as deal in things that are not fit to be sold to prisoners) to wait at the great gate of the prisons from ten o'clock in the morning till three in the afternoon, in order to sell their ware to such prisoners as have wherewithal to pay for them on the spot.

Art. XI. Whatever prisoner shall dare, by this means, to take or bring in strong liquors or other things that are not fit for prisoners, or shall receive or deliver any letter, shall be punished for the abuse he has made of this facility.

134 APPENDIX.

[Calais.]

[English Prisoners.]

The common prison at Calais, being smaller than that at Dunkirk, was much crowded; for it contained one hundred and twenty-seven English prisoners. Seventeen sailors lay in one room* on straw, without coverlets; a few had not even straw: on my complaining of this to the Commissary, he said, he would send to St. Omer's for coverlets. After informing him farther, that I had found captains, passengers and mates confined in France, but that I supposed persons of this description in England were on their parole of honour; he replied, and desired I would note it down, "that a parole could not be granted without security; a hundred guineas for captains, seventy-five for mates, sixty for sailors, and twenty-five for boys." Passengers, I afterwards learned, were on the same footing with captains. On the second day of my being there, the rules (the same with those at Dunkirk) were hung up, both within and without this prison.

Many of the prisoners in this, and other prisons had no change of linen, and some, were almost entirely destitute of clothes; being the crews of vessels shipwrecked in the great storm of Dec. 31, 1778.

PRISONERS OF WAR. 135

[Calais.]

[English Prisoners.]

There were twenty-six of our people in a spacious ward in the military hospital, to whom great attention was paid. Each had a bed and sheets; and their bread and meat were good. But most of them having a disorder which did not break their spirits, they would have been better pleased if their allowance had been equal to that in the prison.

PRISONERS OF WAR in ENGLAND.

[Prisoners of War.]

When I visited my countrymen confined as prisoners of war in France, some of the Commissaries and other gentlemen informed me, that they had received great complaints from the French prisoners in England. On my return in January 1779, I waited on the Commissioners of the sick and wounded and gave them an account of the English prisoners in France, and of my intention to visit the French prisoners. In order to assist me in this business, they very readily favoured me with letters to their agents at several prisons.

Having determined to take another general view of English prisons, to see what improvements had been made, in consequence of two late acts of parliament,* and of the charges given by the Judges in their circuits to the grand juries, I chose to begin my tour in those parts where most of the French prisoners were confined; and of them, therefore, I shall first give some account. In my narration I now add my observations in 1782, on these and other prisoners of war, to whom I paid peculiar attention.

[Plymouth.]

In the Mill-prison near Plymouth, Feb. 3, 1779, there were three hundred and ninety-two French prisoners. The wards and courts in which they were confined, were not so spacious as those appropriated to the American prisoners, nor were they so well accommodated with provisions. The hospital, which had fifty patients in it, was too close.

In the ship Cambridge there were three hundred and ninety-six prisoners; and the next day, two hundred and fifty more were coming in. — The bread was heavy, and the meat bad; and too little attention was then paid to the sick. An hospital ship, called the Tiger, was fitting up for an infirmary.†

† This was an infirmary till the hospital which they were building near Mill-prison was finished.

136 APPENDIX.

[Plymouth.]

[Prisoners of War.]
---
At my visit, July 30, 1782, the old prison was disused, and there were a hundred and eighty-seven French, two Spanish and seven Dutch in a new prison. This is situated on an eminence; the wards are spacious, (twenty feet nine inches wide,) and there is a large area. In the infirmary, the cradles (or bedsteads*) are similar to those in the royal hospital. — All the French prisoners embarked the next day in a cartel.

None of the windows in the wards of this prison (or in that at Shrewsbury) were glazed; they had (Venetian) blinds similar to those in distilleries (see Plate II). This and the airy situation greatly contributed to the health of the prisoners, who also had the advantage of Dr. Farr's frequent visits.

Received into this Prison,

From May 27, 1777, to Aug. 1, 1782, American 1296, Died 45.

June 26, 1778, - Dec. 31, 1782, French 7673, - 109.

Total 10352 - 179.

Of the American prisoners, two hundred and twenty-eight had the smallpox, a hundred and eighty-two of them were inoculated at their own desire. — Twenty-five of the French prisoners died of their wounds.

[Bristol.]

At Bristol, in a prison which had been a pottery, there were a hundred and fifty-one French prisoners, Feb. 9, 1779. The wards were more spacious, and less crowded than those of the prison near Plymouth. There were two day-rooms, in which many shoe-makers, tailors, &c. were at work: an advantage which the prisoners at Plymouth desired, but could not obtain. — The bread was good. — There being no infirmary, the sick were attended and victualled at a small house near the prison, where seven shillings a week was paid for each patient. There were five in that house, in a dirty and offensive room. March 2, 1782, there was a new prison, built on a rising ground about three miles from the city, (two hundred and fifty-six feet by forty-five,) consisting of two floors, each of which having a partition, the wards were twenty-one feet wide. There was no chimney: the wards were dirty, being never washed.
---
* By Dr. Farr's order, the bedsteads in the infirmary were brushed with the oil of tar, to purify the air.

PRISONERS OF WAR. 137

[Bristol.]

[Prisoners of War.]

Adjoining, is a spacious infirmary, which has a fire-place in each ward, and a detached kitchen. The whole was inclosed by a low wall and pales. Here were seven hundred and seventy-four Spanish, and thirteen Dutch prisoners. Their guard was fifty of the militia. — The bread was not so good, and the prisoners had not that attention paid them, as when the prison was the city. — Here was painted on a board, that an open market is allowed from ten to three.

[Winchester.]
---
There were one thousand and sixty-two French prisoners in the prison at Winchester, March 2, 1779. The wards were lofty and spacious. The area large.

The meat and beer were good: but the bread (being made with leaven and mixed with rye) was not so good as that at Bristol.* If two or three of the rooms had been used as work-rooms, the health of the prisoners would have been promoted, and they would not have been indolently lying in their hammocks in the day-time; as I observed they were, both here and at

Several prisoners were confined in the dark hole. — Forty days confinement on half allowance, in order to pay ten shillings to those that apprehend them after escapes, seems to be too severe a punishment. On such occasions, the observation of the worthy magistrates at Bern always occurs to my mind, " that every one must be desirous of regaining liberty. "

The hospital wards were lofty, and upwards of twenty feet wide. Each patient had a cradle, bedding and sheets; and the surgeon paid them great attention, j-

I found the prison, Feb. 26, 1782, cleaner than at my former visit, and many improvements in the wards and courts. The well was in order. The number of prisoners was three hundred and twenty-eight , three hundred and forty-nine Dutch, and thirty-seven Spanish, besides in the infirmary, nine

French, thirty-nine Dutch, and thirty-seven Spani/k — On inquiring for the attentive surgeon, I was forrv to hear, he had died of the ,which was

fatal to many in this prison.

* I particularly observed the bread; for in France it was remarkably good and well baked.

+ Mr. Smith the agent also was assiduous in his department. He mentioned to me, in 1779, that he thought it would be an advantage if one of their pricfls (two of whom were at a little distance on their parole') were permitted to attend the prisoners. This, he said, would be the means of comforting some, of aweing others, and of giving information whenever there was any just reason for complaints. — At my visit in 1782, the Roman catholic prisoners had fitted up a little chapel.

[Forton.]

[Prisoners of War.]

In a prison not very convenient at Forton near there were a hundred and seventy-seven French prisoners, March 2, 1779. On that day the meat was very bad, and had been killed, as the butcher's servant said, that morning: but it was returned, and Mr. Newsham the agent procured them good meat instead of it. — Most of the six-pound loaves wanted weight. I saw the bread weighed for a hundred and forty-two prisoners, and observed a deficiency of three pounds. — The straw, by long use, was turned to dust in the mattresses, and many of them here, and at other places, had been emptied to clear them of vermin. The floors of the bed-rooms and hospitals could not but be dirty and offensive, the boards having been laid rough. I took notice of this kind of bad policy in all the floors of the new prison which was then building here, and almost finished.

The regulations were in the French language, and were the same with those published in a former war. They were evidently the original from which those printed in page 132 are translated. For the sake of greater accuracy, they will be given at the end of the book. I was informed both here and at Winchester, that they had been hung up, but were torn down. The regulations in the Spanish language were the same as those in the French. — It would be better, to paint them on a board, which should be fastened in some conspicuous place in every prison.

On the prisoners complaining that the bread was too light and the meat bad, I referred them to the ninth article of the regulations, by which they are directed to apply to the agent, and (if not redressed) to the Commissioners. One of them pertinently replied, "How is that possible, when every letter is examined by the agent?"*

At my visit November 6, 1782, I found there was no separation of the Americans from other prisoners of war, and they had the same allowance of bread, viz. one pound and a half each. There were a hundred and fifty-four French, thirty-four Dutch, and a hundred and thirty-three Americans; of these twelve French, twenty-five Dutch, and nine Americans were in the hospital.† The wards were not clean. No regulations hung up. I weighed several of the six-pound loaves, and they all wanted some ounces of weight.

* I could have wished, that the gentlemen concerned for the American prisoners, had extended their regards also to the French, and by their attention and visits had obliged the contractors to be more careful in discharging their duty.

† I could not but wish, that in the rooms appropriated to the sick, there had been women nurses, as in the hospitals at Haslar and Plymouth.

The American prisoners then had an allowance from the , paid by order of Dr. Franklin. I found a gentleman of Portsmouth distributing this kind allowance. From Lady-day to Michaelmas, officers received one shilling per week, and seamen six pence: and from Michaelmas to Lady-day, officers two shillings and seamen one shilling per week. American officers were not on parole as other officers.

There was a new temporary prison at Deal. It had an airy and spacious room below, and another above, and a convenient kitchen. — The regulations were hung up, the loaves were full weight, the provisions of all forts were good, and the mattresses had plenty of draw. I made my first visit (as I did always) without the agents or contractors, and I had the pleasure of hearing the prisoners express their satisfaction.

The prison adjoins to the naval hospital, the wards of which were clean and not in the lead offensive. In this the sick and wounded prisoners had the convenience of a ward, similar to that which the English prisoners had at Dunkirk and Calais; and were attended by a skilful and humane surgeon.

There were seventy-three in the prison, and fifteen in this ward, April 17,

1779: and twenty-eight French and three Dutch December 5, 1782, and only

PEMBROKE.

140 APPENDIX.

In the county gaol at Carlisle,in one large room in the debtors ward, there were twelve French prisoners. May io, 1779. They were not supplied with hammocks, as at Plymouth, Winchester, &c. but lay on straw without coverlets. — Their allowance, six pence a day.

On the 5th and 6th of June 1779, I visited the prisons at Pembroke. There were fifty-six French prisoners in an old house adjoining to that in which the Americans were confined. Mod of them had no shoes or dockings, and some were also without shirts. — They had no victualling table, nor did they know what was their allowance. There were two or three who had their allowance in money, which should have been three shillings and six pence a week each for their aliment, but six pence was deducted. They lay, in general, on the boards without draw; for there were but four hammocks in two rooms, each of which contained eighteen prisoners. Here was a court-yard, but no water or sewer.

In the two rooms of the town gaol there were twenty French prisoners. They had some draw, but it had not been changed for many weeks. Having no supply of water in the gaol, and not being permitted, as they were at the other prison, to fetch water for themselves, they were often neglected. On sunday at noon, no water had been brought to them from friday evening. — They walked in a field, with a guard, about an hour every day.- — Their bread was tolerable, but their beer very small, and their allowance of beef so scanty, that they preferred an allowance of cheese and butter.

At a house appropriated for an hospital, there were nine French prisoners, besides five of the crew of the Culloden man of war, and three Americans. These lay in three or four rooms on straw with coverlets, but without sheets, mattresses or bedsteads.

At my visit October 21, 1782, there was a new prison. Two rooms; one on the ground-floor, the other over it (thirty-six feet by sixteen,) very dirty and offensive, though there were only fix French prisoners. They had been confined to their rooms on short allowance from the fourteenth of September for making an escape. The bedding was on the floor; the draw in some of the mattresses had not been changed for eighteen weeks. The prisoners said they were half darved: the bread was very brown, and the weight of the daily allowance only sixteen ounces. No regulations were hung up. — No agent, or relation of any agent, should be concerned in any contratt relative to prisoners of war.

PRISONERS OF WAR. 141

Such observations as these have convinced me, that humanity and good policy require that inspectors of the prisoners of war should be appointed, who should be desired to report quarterly their state as to health, provisions, &c. No doubt some independent gentlemen in the neighbourhood would have accepted such an humane office without salary.

At Chester Castle, Aug. 27, 1779, there were twenty-three French prisoners of war. They were healthy and well, and made no complaint.

At Liverpool, Nov. 30, 17.79, were five hundred and nine prisoners of war,

all French, except fifty-six Spaniards, who were kept separate on account of the animosities between the two nations. These were all confined in four or five rooms crowded with hammocks three tier high; but they had a spacious airing ground, and the prison was situated on a fine eminence. There were thirty-six, sick in some small dirty rooms of a house at a distance from the prison. These had no sheets; but great attention seemed to be paid them by the surgeon, and they made no complaints. At the prison, the bedding wanted regulation. No table of rules or victualling was hung up, (1779) or ever had been. The prisoners rejoiced at the discharge of the late agent; and from the character of the new agent, had every reason to expect all due attention and humanity. Their meat was fine and good; the beer good; the bread heavy. — Sep. 5, 1782,j.here were twenty French,seven Spanish, and seven Dutch prisoners.

Here, as well as at all the other places throughout the kingdom where French prisoners were confined, I found that there was an allowance from the French court of one penny per day to all sailors and boys; two pence to boatswains, carpenters, &c. and three pence to those of superior rank; which was regularly paid them every month. There was besides a supply from the same court of clothes, linen, and shoes to those who were destitute of these articles: a noble and exemplary provision, much to the honour of those who conducted public affairs in France! *

The prison in the fortress at Hull consists of several rooms, with two tier of shelves for the straw, or beds. There were only fifty-one Dutch prisoners, Jan. 30, 1782, many having been lately fent to These prisoners were sensible of the attention paid them by Mr. the surgeon and agent.

In the Castle at Lincoln, Feb. 1, 1782, I found eight Dutch prisoners, who had been taken ill on their march from Hull to One of them, an old man, died the next day; the rest recovered. Their allowance was six pence a day, and they were kindly supplied from a collection made by Dr. Stinlon, chancellor of Lincoln.

At Shrewsbury, in a large and elegant building on the bank of the,

called the orphan-house, (as being erested in 1765 for the reception of children from the foundling-hospital at London,) there were in June 1782, three hundred and thirty-eight Dutch prisoners; twenty-seven of them were in the hospital. The wards were spacious, a hundred and twenty feet by twenty. At the back of the prison there is a fine area of four acres well supplied with water, and at the hospital an area of one acre. The regulations in Dutch and French were hung up. The beds in the hospital were not crowded; all had sheets; and the surgeon paid great attention to the patients.
---
Many of the prisoners were without shoes and stockings, and some had no shirts; for they had not received any bounty from the States, as the French and Spanish prisoners had from their courts. But by a generous subscription in the

[Yarmouth.]

At Yarmouth, July 8, 1782, there were ten French and ninety-two Dutch prisoners. Their rooms and court, and the three rooms of the infirmary were too close. The regulations in French and Dutch were hung up. The provisions were good. The prisoners looked healthy and well: most of them had been brought in but a few days.

[Falmouth.]

At Falmouth, Feb. 6, 1783, there were sixty-five French, twenty-four Spanish and nineteen Dutch prisoners; of whom, sixteen French, six Spanish and five Dutch were in the hospital. The prison was situated on a fine eminence about two miles from the town,* and had plenty of water. The provisions were good, and the prisoners made no complaint. — The hospital was above a mile from the prison. The patients lay single, in good cradles, hair-beds, sheets and coverlets. The wards were tiled, and were the more airy and salutary for not being cieled.

In one of the rooms they lay on straw, two and two, in boxes against the wall, with two coverlets to each box: in the other room they lay on mattresses in hammocks. — The regulations as to diet, &c. were hung up. Their bread was excellent, and all other provisions good; nor was there any thing of which they made complaint. They received every month, the allowance from the French court.

In such close confinement prisoners should always have an iron-lattice door. — The bread was good; the water in the well was brackish, the prisoners should have been permitted with a guard to fetch water every day from the city. — August 17, 1782, there were only five French prisoners.

At Dublin, July 22, 1779, there were twenty-two prisoners of war, in a good room fitted up for a temporary prison. Their bread and other provisions were very good; and they were treated with all the humanity and kindness that could be expected.

AMERICAN PRISONERS.

[Plymouth.]

[American Prisoners.]

In Mill-prison near Plymouth, there were two hundred and ninety-eight American prisoners on the 3d of February 1779. Their wards and court were spacious and convenient, and their bread, beer, and meat good. On July 30, 1782, there were only seven American prisoners.

[Forton.]

The Americans were equally well accommodated at Forton near where I found two hundred and fifty-one prisoners, March 2, 1779.

The table of regulations was almost the same with that for the French prisoners. The principal difference was, that in the victualling table, the bread allowance was then only one pound a day.

[Pembroke.]

At Pembroke, June 5, 1779, there were confined in an old house thirty-seven American prisoners. Some of them were without shoes and stockings. — There was no victualling table, or table of regulations; nor did they know what was the allowance ordered by government. They lay on straw on the floor, and their straw had not been changed for six or seven weeks. — By liberal subscriptions, ample provision had been made for the other American prisoners: I was sorry to find that these had been entirely overlooked.

In a house appropriated for an hospital, in which were some English sailors and French prisoners, I found also three American prisoners, very poorly accommodated. — At my visits in 1782, the Americans were with the other prisoners of war, and had an allowance from the States; as I mentioned at Forton, page 138.

My principal object in procuring lists of the number of prisoners of war who had been received and had died in the several prisons, was to refute a prevailing opinion of our severity and inattention to such prisoners. These lists, which I received from the agents, were afterwards checked by the books of the Commissioners of sick and wounded seamen, &c. in London, who readily granted me that favour.

Before I leave this subject, it will be but justice to mention the care and assiduity of the Commissioners, who themselves visited many of the prisons

[American Prisoners.]

in England, and dismissed such agents as had abused their trust; and who are ready to receive any information which may be for the benefit of those committed to their care.

SCOTLAND.

[Scotland.]

It may not be improper, before I enter on a particular account of English prisons, to mention what further occurred to me worthy of observation, in my journeys into Scotland and Ireland in 1779, 1782, and 1783.

The prisons which I saw in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Haddington, Ayr, Kelso, Nairne, Bamff, Inverness, &c. were generally old buildings, dirty and offensive, and without courts.

If a prisoner for debt declares upon oath that he has not wherewithal to maintain himself, the creditor must aliment him within ten days after notice is given for that purpose, with at least three pence a day,* but generally the magistrates order six pence. — By the process of Cessio bonorum,† a debtor after being a month in prison, may obtain his liberty, and be secured against execution for any previous debts, by making a surrender of all his effects to be divided among his creditors: though if he afterwards comes into better circumstances, his effects may be attached for the payment of those debts. This compassionate law prevents a creditor putting his debtor in prison, unless he has good reason to believe he is acting fraudulently.

Perjury is not frequent in Scotland. The oath, and the form of administering it, are very solemn. The witness, holding up his right hand, repeats the following words after the judge:- "By God himself, and as you shall answer to God at the great day of judgment, you shall declare the truth, and nothing but the truth, in so far as you know, or shall be asked at you." — The depositions are read over by the clerk, and signed by the witnesses and the judge.‡ — It is enabled by the 20th of Geo. II. that "the circuit-courts shall be regularly held twice in every year, within that

[Scotland.]

"part of Great Britain called Scotland, and the Judges thereof shall continue by the space of six days at the least, at each town or place where the circuit-courts shall be held, for the dispatch of business."*

There are in Scotland but few prisoners; this is partly owing to the shame and disgrace annexed to imprisonment; partly to the solemn manner in which oaths are administered, and trials and executions conducted; and partly to the general sobriety of manners produced by the care which parents and ministers take to instruct the rising generation.†

I am indebted to Andrew Crosbie, Esq. for an account, from the clerk of the justiciary, of the executions from January 1768 to May 1782, which shall be inserted in a table at the end of the book; from which it will appear, that in thirteen years and a half, there have been fifty-four executed, and twenty-two pardoned.

In Scotland,executions formerly were not delayed after conviction or sentence; such delays being often equally injurious to the criminal and to society. Here, the punishment of the offender was made to appear the immediate consequence of his crime.‡

* This good act is similar to one enacted for the counties of Wales in 34th and 35th of Henry VIII. Chap. XXVI. "That every of the said sessions shall be kept and continued by the space of six days in every of the said shires, at either of the said times, as is and hath been used within the said three shires of North Wales."

† It is provided by statute in the sixth session of king William's first parliament, 1696, Chap. XXVI. "That there be a school fettled and established, and a schoolmaster appointed in every parish" in Scotland, and the presbytery has the superintendence of the execution of this act, which has been carefully attended to. Many schools are also settled by donations and legacies, and by the society for propagating christian knowledge; so that no parish is without a school, and in some there are four or five. In the southern parts of Scotland, it is very rare that you meet with any person that cannot both read and write. It is scandalous for any person not to be possessed of a Bible, which is always read in the parochial schools.

‡ By the act made in king William's first session, 1695, Chap. IV. all capital crimes are restricted to the trial and sentence within three Suns; and the "Execution, which is hereby left to the discretion of the Judge, not exceeding nine days after sentence." — The Statute of the 11th of Geo. I. Chap. XXVI. enacts, that no sentence of death, or corporal punishment, can, on the south side of the Forth, be put in execution in less than thirty, and on the north, than forty days. This statute is altered in so far as respects punishments that amount neither to death nor demembration; and the law allows all such lesser corporal punishments to be inflicted after eight days on the south side of the river Forth, and twelve days on the north side of the river Forth. This alteration is made by the statute of the 3d of Geo. II.

I will only just mention the close confinement of poor* criminals in the Tolbooth, the horrid cage in the room known by that name, and the severity practised there of chaining the condemned to an iron bar; because I found that the late Provost Mr. Stuart† was using his best endeavours to get a new gaol built, which should be subject to better regulations and stand in a more airy situation.

[Infirmary.]

I could not but admire the Royal Infirmary at Edinburgh. Few hospitals in England exceed it in airiness and cleanliness. Great attention is paid to the patients, and their complaints are very accurately minuted: the students attend the physician in his round of the wards. The success of this institution is evident, from the few that die in comparison with the number admitted. The proportion of deaths to the number admitted, from 1770 to 1775 inclusive, was as one to twenty-five nearly. In 1776 and 1777, the proportion was nearly as one to twenty-nine. The total number of patients admitted in 1780 was two thousand two hundred and twenty-eight, of whom seventy-six died: the number in 1781 was two thousand two hundred and six, of whom seventy-four died — Dr. John Hope, the first physician in this hospital (who lives very near it and gives unremitting attendance) informed me, that two or three years ago, a putrid fever prevailed in it; but that white-washing the walls had eradicated the infection, and that this salutary practice had been continued ever since.‡

And the council hereby ordains James Cleland principal jailor and his successors in office, to affix a copy hereof in the Tolbooth-hall, and in his own office, under the penalty of £5 Scots, toties quoties.

* I say poor, because such as have money have too much liberty. For in the same prison, I lately saw some, who were confined for a riot, drinking whiskey in the tap-room, in company with many profligate townsmen, who were readily admitted, as they promoted the sale of the gaoler's liquors.

† I must not omit here making my acknowledgments to the magistrates of Edinburgh, for the honour they did me, by presenting me with the freedom of this city.

‡ On my visit at Haslar hospital in November 1782, I had the pleasure to hear that there was an order to white-wash the wards twice a year.

152 APPENDIX.

[Edinburgh Orphan-hospital.]

The Orphan-hospital also deserves particular commendation, in which in 1782, there were about seventy boys and sixty girls, who appeared decently clothed, cheerful, clean and healthy. The girls are taught (besides reading and writing) spinning, knitting, sewing and houshold work; and the boys carding, spinning, knitting, mending their clothes, &c. All are educated in the principles of virtue and religion, and formed to such habits as may tend to make them good servants and apprentices. Every part of the house was clean. — The maintenance, &c. for each child, is about five pounds. — Mr. Tod, the treasurer, merits peculiar respect for the attention and zeal with which he endeavours to promote the usefulness and credit of this hospital.

[Glasgow Tolbooth.]

In the Tolbooth at Glasgow, July 9, 1779, there were thirteen debtors and seven criminals; and in the house of correction, seventeen women were spinning, decently clothed: in September 1782, there were eighteen debtors and five criminals in the Tolbooth,* and twenty-six prisoners in the house of correction.

It would answer no end to give a description of all the Scotch prisons. I will, therefore, only add to this account the following particulars.

[Dumfries.]

At Dumfries in the court-house is a room called the open gaol, (sixteen feet three inches by eleven feet three) with closets and a fire-place, where a debtor that finds bail has the key, and may converse at the door. — The gaol in this town was burnt by a prisoner some years ago. To prevent this for the future, the rooms in it have been vaulted.

2. The jaylor shall, from 1st of April to 1st of October, open each day the prison at eight, and shut it half an hour after nine in the morning; open it at eleven before noon, and shut it half an hour after two o'clock afternoon; open it at four o'clock afternoon, and shut it at ten o'clock at night. And from the 1st of October to the 1st of April, he shall open the prison each day at nine in the morning, and shut it half an hour after two o'clock afternoon; open it at four o'clock afternoon, and shut it at ten o'clock at night; only on Sundays, the prison shall be shut during publick worship, any thing in this rule to the contrary. And the jaylor is always to keep the whole keys of the prison in his own custody while it is shut up, and not entrust them with any of his servants.

3. The jaylor, every morning and evening, at the opening of, and before shutting up the prison, shall personally visit every room and place therein, carefully inspect the windows, chimnies, and walls thereof, in order to prevent and discover all attempts to cut the iron stanchers, or to break through the stone walls, joists, and floors of the prison, and he shall take particular care, that no instruments be conveyed to, or be in the possession of any of the prisoners, whereby they may effectuate their escape, or hurt one another; and in case the jaylor shall, through indisposition, be prevented from the execution of his duty, he shall take care to employ some faithful person in his absence.

4. The jaylor and his servants, are expressly prohibited, on any account, to sell, or suffer to be brought in to any of the prisoners, spirits, or strong liquor, whereby they may be in danger of being intoxicated; and to use their utmost endeavours to promote sobriety amongst those under their charge.

154 APPENDIX.

[Aberdeen.]

The like accident happened to the upper floor of the Tolbooth at Aberdeen, a neat and clean prison, the upper floor of which is now very properly arched over.

[Inverness Tolbooth.]

The Tolbooth at Inverness has no fire-place, and is the most dirty and offensive prison that I have seen in Scotland. The room for debtors is sixteen feet by fourteen and a half: that for felons about thirteen feet and a half square, and only six feet and a half high; the window is twenty inches by six.*

In one of the piers of the stone-bridge at Inverness, there is a vaulted room intended for a prison. This room was constructed in 1684, when the bridge was built, but had not been opened for three years before my late visit. Near the wall of the bridge there is a trap-door twenty-two inches square, and a few steps down from it, an iron door (two feet three inches wide, and two feet and a half high,) from which there is a descent of a few steps more to the room just mentioned, which is ten feet four inches by seven feet six, and six feet high. On the sides there is a stone seat, a small window, and two apertures to dip for water, &c.

5. The jaylor shall keep the prisoners for debt, in the best rooms, and separate from criminals and disorderly persons, and prevent, as much as possible, their associating and converting together, and the friends and servants of debtors. Shall be allowed at all convenient times, to bring in vivers for their support.

6. In order to make the prison more healthy and clean, the jaylor shall, at his own expence, cause pair and clean the stairs, sweep the rooms, and remove and carry away all filth and nastiness, at least, three times in the week.

7. The jaylor, in the event of his exacting, by himself, or his servants, more fees than stipulated as above, or in the event of transgressing any of the rules or instructions foresaid, shall be dismissed from his office, or otherwise punished as the magistrates, for the time being, and council shall judge proper.

It is recommended to the magistrates, frequently to examine and enquire into the fidelity of the jaylor and his servants; and the council hereby ordains these dues and regulations to be printed and published, that none may pretend ignorance; and ordains John Rowan jaylor, and his successors in office, to affix a copy hereof in the most publick part of the Tolbooth, under the penalty of ten pounds Scots.

* As this is the circuit-town for seven other counties, (one third of Scotland,) I hope the judges will recommend the erection of a new gaol. A regard to themselves requires this; for the offensive room in which the criminals are lodged, opens into the court. — Part of the forfeited estates might be appropriated to that purpose.

IRELAND. 155

[Scotland.]

The following defects may be remarked in the prisons in Scotland. They have no courts belonging to them,* and generally want water and sewers.

They are not visited by the magistrates, and too little attention is paid to the reparation of the sexes: the keepers are allowed licences for the sale of the most pernicious liquors; the consequence of which is, that the county allowance being paid in money to the prisoners, they generally spend it in whiskey instead of bread.

IRELAND.

[Dublin New Prison.]

I was happy in finding at Dublin in 1779, a new prison almost ready for the removal of the prisoners into more airy and convenient apartments, in which I hoped the shocking intercourse of the two sexes which took place in the old prison, would be avoided. This new prison is one hundred and seventy feet in length, and has separate courts for men and women. The cells on the first and second floors are about twelve feet by eight, and on the upper floor twelve by four, all arched with brick, to prevent danger from fire.† I was sorry to find dungeons, and wished they might never be used, except, at night for the condemned. It might be best to convert the chapel at the top of the house into an infirmary; for the sick rooms are too small, and likely to produce infection.
---
In the two courts there are pumps. Great attention should be paid to air and cleanliness in the staircases, cells and vaults, and in the narrow passages,J to prevent them from becoming offensive and infectious. I well remember the dreadful state o t Dublin Newgate in the beginning of the year 177 5, when I saw numbers of poor creatures, ill with the gaol unattended and disregarded.

* The original cause of this seems to have been the following very severe maxim in the Scotch law. " After a debtor is imprisoned, he ought not to be indulged the benefit of the air, not even under a guard; for creditors have an interest, that their debtors be kept under close confinement, that, by the squalor carceris, they may be brought to pay their debt." Act Sell'. 14. June 1671. The Principles of the L of Scotland,5th edit, p.461.

† It would have been much better if the same precaution had been used in London Newgate.

J The passages are three feet and a half wide, and the staircases only two feet one inch.

156 APPENDIX.

[Dublin New Prison.]

The criminals in the gaols of Ireland are very numerous. One reason of this may be, that in this country there are no houses of correction, unless cages could be called fo, in which drunken or riotous persons are locked up for a night or two. * Another reason is, that acquitted persons are continued in confinement till they have discharged their fees to the clerk of the crown, or peace, the sheriff, gaoler and turnkey, f Even boys almost naked, and under the age of twelve, are sometimes confined a year or two for these fees, though amounting to no more than about forty shillings. J How surprising is it, that any kingdom can endure such injustice ! It is a particular aggravation of it, that the prisoners thus confined, generally lofe, at the same time, their allowance of bread. || I have heard that Lord chief justice Aston often ordered the

* It may be an exception, that in a house adjoining to old Newgate called the black dog% there were several fines, &c. and that in another house (a fort of bridewell adjoining to the work-house in Dublin) I found in 1779 eleven young creatures; some of these for small offences were confined with outrageous lunatics. The magistrates seem to have overlooked a com-passionate direction in an act of their legislature (fee 3d of George III. Chap. XXVIII.) t€ that persons of insane mind and outrageous behaviour " are not to go in common with the other 4 prisoners.

f There is an act for discharging without fees, persons who shall be acquitted €t of offences " for which they are or shall be indicted, and for making a compensation to sheriffs, gaolers, " clerks of the crown, and clerks of the peace, for such fees," by a presentment on the respective counties. But many that are acquitted receive no benefit by it, because the presentment must be made by the foreman of the petty jury to the grand jury, and confirmed by the Judges of assize; and also the sum presented at one assize must not exceed " ten pounds if it be " a county at large or * five pounds, if it be a county of a city or county of a town." 3d George III. Cap. V. p. 100, 101.

|| Since writing the above, by an act of 21 and 22 of George III. for revising, continuing and amending several temporary statutes, it has been enacted (page 827) "that every person " confined or to be confined in any of his majesty's gaols within this kingdom, charged with " any criminal offence, shall be intitled to receive the prisoners allowance of bread, during the *' time of his or her said confinement; and if such person shall, after having been tried for such " offence and acquitted thereof, be confined for his or her fees, every such person so confined * shall be in like manner intitled to the like allowance." — This however being the last clause in the act, as Sir Francis Hutchinson justly observed to me, has escaped the attention of the compiler of the small gaol-code.

acquitted prisoners to be discharged. In 1779 I obtained the release of some Dublin boys from the county gaol at Kilmainham, on paying for them half fees; and of New-

Prison.

some others from Newgate,the sheriffs of Dublinconfenting to relinquish their fees. But as those boys had been associated with the most profligate and abandoned felons for many months, I did not in the least wonder to find that some of them returned to their former habitation in a few days. In 1783 the deputy keeper of the new prison gave me a lift of sixteen detained for their fees.

At Kilmainham also I found there were fifteen acquitted prisoners confined for their fees in the dungeons. At both these prisons I restored to their families several who seemed the most proper objects of companion. Some had children dying with the smallpox, others had hardly rags to cover them. But this distress had no more effect on the clerk of the crown, sheriffs and gaolers, than to engage them to give up half their fees.

In 1782, a bill was brought in by Mr. Provo 0:Hut which passed into an act for discharging all those who were then in confinement for fees only,

(21st and 22d of George III. Chap. XLI.) I have every reason to hope, from the attention and humanity of this gentleman, that during the present session, a perpetual act for the same purpose will be passed.

On passing the old prison frequently, I could not avoid observing officers from the recruiting regiments waiting at the doors and windows, to receive either the offenders who were permitted to enlist, or any of their associates.

When the excessive profligacy and daring wickedness of this fet of people is considered, the most melancholy apprehensions must be entertained, of the dreadful consequences likely to result from their mixture with those who may have had a sober education, and have entered voluntarily into the service of their country and likewise of the danger to society in general, from turning loose such a fet of wretches at the close of a war.

Our English prisons have also contributed their share towards recruiting the army, enlisting being the condition on which many have obtained their release from confinement, or immunity from some other punishment. I shall make no farther remark on this practice, but that if it be a necessary one, the legislature may receive some satisfaction from the effects of their late salutary *

laws respecting the health of prisoners. mode had been adopted while prisons were in their former state, it would have been the occasion of carrying the most fatal diseases into the midst of our seamen and soldiers.

Marshalsea. There is a new Marshalsea prison in Dublin. The .first stone was laid, as appears by the inscription, July 3, 1775. At my visit in 1779, here were about sixty prisoners.* — In the city ,which is a very old building,

there were fifty-five debtors. Some debtors in this and the other prisons, being not alimented, are objects of compassion. But many of them are relieved by the care of a humane society at Dublin, similar to that called the Society in London. — Such societies deserve the highest praise. I wish however to recommend to compassion other prisoners (whose miseries have been long hid from the eyes of the public) who, though they seem to deserve assistance less, yet need it the more, to fave them from the ruin to which the bad state of the prisons exposes them. . t House I observed with pleasure, the progressive improvements in the House of

Industry. At my last visits, the house, infirmary, and cells for the lunatics

were quite clean, and the numerous inhabitants quiet and orderly; which is chiefly owing to the daily inflection of the governors in rotation. In the year which ended March 25, 1782, there came in voluntarily two thousand eight hundred and nineteen, and four hundred and sixty were compelled. August 2, 1783, the number was one thousand four hundred and forty.

There is an Irish act for preserving the health of prisoners, palled in the 17th and 18th of George III. Chap. XXVIII. similar to the English acts for

* In one of the insolvent acts in Ireland (nth George II. Chap. XVI. p. 9S6) I found a singular clause, which I with had been inserted in some of our late insolvent acts; to compel debtors, who " chuse rather to continue in prison, and spend their, fubrtance there, than discover, and deliver up to their creditors, their estate and effects, in order to the satisfaction of their just debts," &c.

f This differs from the English act in one important circumstance. The English act requires

" the walls and cielings of the several cells and wards, both of the debtors and the felons, " and also of any other rooms used by the prisoners in their respective gaols and prisons, 'where " felons are usually confined, to be scraped and white-washed, once in the year at lealt, to be * regularly waftied and kept clean, &c." whereas the Irish act requires the same precautions in the cells, wards, and rooms of gaols and prisons without restriction; for the clause "where felons are usually confined" is omitted. I have known it pleaded as an excuse for not white-washing and keeping clean prisons in England, where only debtors or petty offenders have been confined, that, they were not obliged to it by the act of parliament.

the same purpose, but it was not known in any of the prisons. There is also an act of the same year, similar to the English act, for " the punishment, by hard labour, of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported. " But the hulks on the Thames having cruelly destroyed many healthy and robufh young men, their cries probably reached the Irish shore, and prevented any proceedings in consequence of that act.

In 1782, I found that the House of Commons had taken into consideration that part of the police which respects prisons, and had appointed a gaol committee for this purpose. To this committee I reported the state of several of the prisons in Dublin*

I carefully inspected the gaols in Dublin in 1783. The following remarks on the new prison I think particularly worth mentioning. It is not kept clean — The pumps being out of order there is no regular supply of water — There is no proper separation of the sexes from one another — or of petty offenders from the most abandoned criminals — Numbers of acquitted prisoners are detained for the fees — Such as are committed to hard labour are confined in idleness — There is no bedding though the floors are flone — Spirituous

* A noggin or gill of that pernicious and destructive liquor 'whiskey, is fold in Dublin so cheap as three halfpence or two pence, and half a pint for three pence or four pence. This makes it the common liquor of prisoners and of the lower class of people, who are often intoxicated by it almoll to madness.

f Garnish is three shillings and nine pence halfpenny, several of those whom I had relreased gave the same account of it.

I The day-room on the women's side was always ftiut up. At my last visit the condemned criminals were in the men's day-room; and the women's day-room was kept locked, for two or three felons who lodged in the deputy keeper's room to play in at tennis and other diversions.

‖ Two of the committee of the House of Commons in June 1782 accompanied me to the new prison, and examined some of the sick who lay on the flone-floors totally neglected. Dr. Cleghorn and Dr. Scott have been since ordered by the grand jury to attend them; but no bedding, no alteration of diet, and no nurses are ordered for them. I was sorry to find in 1783, that the former ingenious young physician had died of the gaol fever.

§ The only building designed for a bath which I saw in the gaols in Ireland', was in the court-yard at Trim, June 17, 1782. I looked into it, and found it was the gaoler's pig-fty.

To this gaol there are ample appointments. But such appointments can be of little consequence, while the sheriffs and magistrates neglect their duty, and seldom or never inspect the gaols or punish defaulters. — Are not such magistrates inexcusably guilty ? — Should they not be considered as ‘accessary to the crimes and abuses and miseries occasioned by their neglect ?

Most of the remarks now made on this gaol at ,are applicable to

many of the county gaols. — I enumerate these particulars, not with a view of aggravating the idea of inattention to these objects in or making

a comparison between their management, and that in this country (which is still greatly defective); but with a view of inciting the public-spirited Irish gentlemen, now occupied on this subject, to fet an example of a thorough and effectual reform, which may be imitated by this nation.

By an act of 21st and 22d of Geo. III. all judges, from and after the 24th of June 1783, are required to give in charge to the grand juries the two acts, one for the better preventing the severities and unjust exactions practised by gaolers against their prisoners, &c. (3d Geo. III.) the other for preserving the health of prisoners in gaol, &c. (17 th and 18th Geo. III.) and the judges are further required to examine into the state and situation of the different gaols, and the conduct of the gaolers, and to impose a fine on the county not exceeding £$00 for neglect of repairing and enlarging such gaols. — Lord Temple, Lord Lieutenant in 1782, whose spirited and patriotic exertions in Ireland will be long remembered there, ordered the sheriffs to report the state of the county gaols, directing at the same time the (six) acts relative to prisons* to be sent to every sheriff. His lordship also introduced a new mode of execution at the New-prison and Kilmainham. The criminals come out of a front window on a scaffold, which falling down, they are left hanging.

Having taken notice of several of the orphan-schools abroad, I cannot help adding an account of some particulars relating to the Protestant schools. Their number is forty-one, besides four nurseries to supply them with children. In visiting them I carried with me a sermon preached before the incorporated society, (to which is added an account of the several schools) published in 1781, at the request of the society. In the two schools near Dublin, that at Clontarf-Strand for boys, and at Santry for girls, I was greatly surprised to find but forty-six in the former, and thirty-four in the latter, though the numbers given in the published account were a hundred boys and forty girls. At Kilkenny and Cajlledermot the deficient numbers were twenty-

six in the former, and seventeen in the latter; and there was a like deficiency in some of the other schools. These schools are managed by a committee of fifteen, who meet every week in Dublin.* This committee has lately discovered a consciousness of their error in publishing such false accounts, and suffering them to be delivered from the pulpit; for in the la the true numbers seem to be given; and they amount to about seven hundred (or near a third) less than the numbers which bad been before dated-

The masters of these schools hold a certain quantity of land belonging to the society, for which they pay no higher rent than was paid when the ground was originally granted. Every mader is allowed a salary of and

contracts for the clothing, diet, and work of the children. These contracts are so low {viz. annual clothing, fi: 5:0 diet, ^3:2: 6) that the date of most of the schools which I visited was so deplorable, as to disgrace protedantism and encourage popery in Ireland, rather than the contrary. — If the committee find a decrease in their funds, a less number of these schools with proper attention-, will do the society much more credit than a large number of such sickly, naked and half starved children as I found in them, f In short; these schools demand a thorough parliamentary inquiry.

May I be allowed to hint; that there should be one plain decent uniform for all the children — Didinft schools for each sex — Clean linen twice a week — A convenient bath — A larger allowance for diet, and for washing, fire and candles — A crib beddead for each child — Rooms appropriated to the sick, and an apothecary for each house — Didindl work-rooms and dining-rooms, and an area inclosed for play — That the mader's or midrefs's bed-room should be situated so as to look into the children's dormitory — The provincial nurseries abolished, and that at Dublin put on a larger plan (since if proper attention were paid to the children, the admission of a child would be a matter of favour and intreaty) — That a check should be kept on the local committee by the

HULKS on the THAMES.

In my former work, p.75, I ventured to pass some censures on the management of convicts committed to hard labour on the Thames-, and in a subse-quest visit I was still more convinced of the faults I had observed. The effects of these became so alarming, as to attract the notice of parliament. A public inquiry was instituted, by which it appeared, that from August 1776, when the convicts were first put on board the JuJlitia, to March 26, 1778, out of six hundred and thirty-two prisoners who had been received, one hundred and seventy-six had died. It is with pleasure that I can give an account, which will shew in a striking light the beneficial effects of this parliamentary inquiry, as to the health of the prisoners, and the obligations the public were under to the committee appointed on this occasion, and particularly to its chairman. Sir Charles Bunbury.

convicts, an old India man, called the 'Justitia and a frigate, the Censor. In the former were two hundred and fifty-six; and in the latter, two hundred and fifty. That which was first called the , is converted into an hospital ship, in which were twenty patients. — Another, called the , was

empty: in this, convicts were examined by the surgeon, and continued three days, before they were fent either to the hulks, or to the hospital lhip.*

The prisoners on board the JuJlitia looked healthy and well; the decks were clean. They had bedding; their provisions were good of the fort; and there were not any (as at my former visits) without shoes and stockings. — I found the Censor, below deck, cleaner than the JuJlitia-, yet, on carefully viewing the

convicts, they had not so healthy and contented an aspect as those in the other;

and a much greater proportion of this ship's company was fent to the hospital. This created in me a suspicion that something was wrong. I examined all their provisions, bedding, &c. and found that they were the same as on board the JuJiitia. It would be highly proper that a table of their stated allowance should be hung up,* and feales, weights and measures assigned them, to check the purlers who give out their provision. j- In the hospital ship, on the two decks (one of which is for recovering patients) were twenty-five cradles with beds, but smaller than those in the royal hospitals at Hajlar and Plymouth, where all lie single. Of the few who were very sick, I found their irons were off. The cleanliness and quietness of the hospital did honour to the conductor. It is to be wished that the patients had better nourishment, as that, in many cases would be more salutary than medical prescriptions.

There were about one hundred and fifty at work in the Warren in 1779, most of them clothed in a brown uniform. I observed that the situation of these unhappy people was altered for the better. Yet their bread allowance of one pound a day was too little, especially for those who worked, although they had an extra allowance of beer.

At my visit Dec. 27, 1782, the Censor and the Reception were laid up. There were on board the JuJiitia one hundred and eighty convicts, and in the hospital ship twenty-four. Of these, a hundred and sixteen were employed in removing ballall, planking, &c. on shore; and thirty-six were heaving ballad in the lighters. The hospital ship was very clean, the other not dirty.

Some alteration is made in the bread allowance: the mess of fix men is now seven pounds. The diet table J is hung up in the of the JuJiitia: I could

wish it were for the inspection of the convicts. There should be to each bed in winter, an additional blanket.

At my visit October 19, 1783, there were on board the a hundred and seventy-two, and in the hospital ship twenty-two. The men in the JuJlitia looked well, which I doubt not was in a great measure owing to their being employed, and also restrained from spirituous and other strong liquors. — Of late, but few of them have died: this shews that their situation is better with respect to health, but the afibciation of so many criminals is utterly destructive to morals. — The Censor had a hundred and thirty-seven convicts for our settlements; many of whom being sickly objects, and in want of clothes and bedding, I was persuaded would die in the passage. My mind reverted to the Portuguese method with their convicts. (See page 106.)

[Remarks on the Gaol Fever.]

I shall take the liberty here to subjoin a few additional remarks on the gaol fever; in which, if I shall appear to have invaded the province of the gentlemen of the faculty, I hope to be pardoned, from the consideration that my experience in this matter may in some resped supply my want of other means of knowledge.*

If it were asked, what is the cause of the gaol fever ? it would in general be readily replied, "the want of fresh air and cleanliness." But as I have found in some prisons abroad, cells and dungeons as offensive and dirty as any I have observed in this country, where, however, this distemper was unknown, I am obliged to look out for some additional cause for its production. I am of opinion, that the sudden change of diet and lodging so affects the /pints of new convicts, that the general causes of putrid fevers exert an immediate effed upon them. Hence it is common to see them sicken and die in a short time, with very little apparent illness. Convicts are generally flout robust young men, who have been accustomed to free diet, tolerable lodgings, and vigorous exercise. These are ironed, and thrust into close offensive dungeons, some of them without draw or other bedding; in which they continue, in winter, fifteen or sixteen hours out of the twenty-four, in utter inadivity, and immersed in the

Author of my being, temperance and cleanliness are my preservatives. Trusting in Divine Providence, and believing myself in the way of my duty, I visit the most noxious cells; and while thus employed, " I fear no evil." — I never enter an hospital or prison before breakfast, and in an offensive room I seldom draw my breath deeply.

[Remarks on the Gaol Fever.]

noxious effluvia of their own bodies. On this account, the gaol distemper is always observed to reign more in our prisons during winter than summer;* contrary, I presume, to the nature of other putrid diseases. Their diet is at the same time low and scanty; they are generally without firing; and the powers of life soon become incapable of refilling so many causes of sickness and despair.

After the gaol fever has prevailed in a prison in which the sides &c. are brick, stone or plaster, nothing will be so effectual in destroying all remains of infection, as scraping the walls, and then washing them with hot lime, flaked in boiling water. But if the sides &c. of the prison be wood, the mode of fumigation practised by the ingenious Dr. Lind for infefled pips, will be very proper: I shall therefore extract some of the most important particulars of this process from the account with which the Doctor favoured me.

"Charcoal fires should be lighted in the morning, and allowed to remain till evening, and half a pound of brimstone thrown upon each, their smoke in the mean time being closely confined. They may be made in iron pots. This fumigation should be repeated every day for a fortnight. " Every evening after the fumigation, the ports and hatchways should be opened, and the inside of the fflip waffled with warm vinegar: and after the last fumigation, before the men return to the fflip, the decks should be thoroughly scraped and cleaned. If the infeflion has been very violent, the parts of the fflip most exposed to it may also be white-waffled. — Every " thing ragged and dirty should be destroyed, as also the clothes and bedding of such as brought the infection into the ship, the bedding of such as have died of the fever, and unless the infection has been very mild, the bedding of such as have had the fever though recovered. The remaining clothes and bedding should be purified by being exposed twice a week to the fleams of the brimstone and charcoal; or when the brimstone might be supposed to " injure the clothes, they may be hung up in a close place, exposed to the " smoke of tobacco strewed on charcoal fires.I Linens, and such articles as

* In conversation with the physician to the military hospital at on my observing that the windows of the wards were shut; he answered, "almost all our disorders are in winter, for the Russians inclose themselves in hot rooms, and dislike the fresh air, even before the cold months commence."

+ I have observed in prisons abroad a very cheap and pleasant fumigation, which fur-prisingly corrects the offensiveness of the bad air. I suppose it is the same as is used in catholic churches, viz.juniper berries thrown upon burning coals in a chafing-dish.

HULKS on the THAMES. 167

will admit of being wet, should after the first fumigation be steeped for Remarks " several hours in cold water or leys, be well washed, and then dried in the 0N THE " open air. — If, during the fortnight of this fumigation, any person is taken Gaol Fev£i " ill of the fever, the fortnight should again commence from the day on which " such person leaves the ship. — Strict attention should be paid to the cleanliness " of the men both in their persons and apparel: such as are sluggish and dirty " should be made to bathe and clean themselves; and a sufficient quantity of " flops should be issued, that every man may have a change of clothes." *

In my visits in 1779, I found only one person that had the gaol fever; he was in Newgate under sentence of death. In 1782, I did not find one person that had that disorder in any prison throughout the kingdom. But from the bad construction of many of our gaols, and the inattention of magistrates to in-- fpedt them, and to see that gaolers &c. do their duty, I found in 1783 several of our prisons verging to their old state. The convicts fent from Maidstone,

Chelmsford, Glocester, Newgate, Borough-gaol, &c. confirm my suspicions that this disorder is not eradicated. I am persuaded that a thorough reform of the prisons is not to be expedited, without the further and more effectual interference of the legislature.

I shall close this part, with reciting a few particulars which I think of consequence in the construction and regulation of hospitals, most of which have been collected from the observations I have made abroad.

The 'situation of an infirmary or hospital should be on elevated ground, gear a stream, and out of a town — the entrance to it by a flight of easy steps — the wards from twenty -five to thirty feet high, arched, and without buildings over themj- — distinct wards for medical and chirurgical patients j| ——

Remarks on Hospitals*

•Sir John Pringle, in his Anniversary Discourse at the Royal Society, on the subject of Captain Cook's successful care of the ship's crew in his voyage round the world* and the medal deservedly adjudged to him on that account, has the following passage at page 26. * It is

*s well known how much cleanliness conduces to health; but it is not so obvious how much it " also tends to good order and other virtues.. That diligent officer was persuaded, — that such. t€ men as he could induce to be more cleanly than'they were disposed to be of themselves, * became at the same time more sober, more orderly, and more attentive to their duty. (This remark is confirmed by an observation in the Spectator, No. 631.) " Several vices destructive both to mind and body, are inconiiflent with the habit of cleanliness.99

THE TOWER is a strong fortress, and the only prison in for

state delinquents of rank. The care of it is committed to an officer called the Constable of the Tower, who has under him a lieutenant, deputy-lieutenant called the governor, and many other officers, among whom are forty warders, whose uniform is the same with the king's yeomen of the guards. Nineteen of these warders have separate houses well furnished, in any of which, as the governor is pleased to order, the state delinquents may be confined;

then, iron bars are fixed to their windows by the board of works. Sometimes they are committed to close confinement; but in general they are at liberty to walk in the area of the Tower, attended always by a warder.

There had been no prisoners here for several years before my visit in 1779.

When there are any, they are generally soon brought to a legal trial, and consequently their confinement is not long. Six shillings and eight pence a day is allowed by government for their subsistence, but they seldom accept this allowance. — Sep. 1, 1783, there were no prisoners. Mr. Laurens was the last, who went out Dec. 31, 1781.

In this fortress, besides the houses jult mentioned, there are several public offices and store-houses; such, particularly, as the office of Ordnance, the Jewel-office, the Mint, and buildings for holding artillery and arms.

NEWGATE.

In 1779 the Gaol was clean, and free from offensive scents. On the felons side there were only three sick, in one of the upper wards. An infirmary was building near the condemned cells. — Of the one hundred and forty-one felons &c. there were ninety-one convicts and fines,* who had only the prison allowance of a penny loaf a day: Mr. Akerman generously contributed towards their relief. — In the felons court, the table of fees painted on a board was hung up.

This gaol was burnt by the rioters in 1780, but is rebuilt on the same plan.

The men's quadrangle is now divided into three courts. In the first court, are those that pay three shillings and six pence a week for a bed; in the next the poorer felons; and in the other, now the women. Under the chapel are cells for the refra&ory. Two rooms adjoining to the condemned cells, are built for an infirmary, in one of which, at my last visit, there were sixteen sick. Of the two hundred and ninety-one prisoners in 1782, two hundred and twenty-five were men, and sixty-six women. Upwards of a hundred of them were transports, eighty-nine fines, twenty-one under sentence of death, and the remainder lay for trial. Some of the condemned had been long sick and

After the riots in 1780, the debtors were confined in Clerkenwell bridewell or the New Prison, but at my lafb visit they were in Newgate. The felons on the common side now have a three halfpenny loaf a day. The chaplain now has not the freedoms, but his salary is augmented to £180, and the sheriffs pay him fj: 12:0. The surgeon's salary is augmented-to £100.

I cannot forbear mentioning a practice which probably had its origin from the ancient mode of torture. When prisoners capitally convicted at the Bailey are brought up to receive sentence, and the judge aflcs, " What have " you to fay why judgment of death and execution should not be awarded " against you ? " the executioner flips a whipcord noose about their thumbs. This custom ought to be abolished.

This Prison was burnt by the rioters in 1780. It is rebuilt on the same plan. The floors of the cellar, hall, and first story are now stone, and arched with brick. The tapster (till has all the cellar floor: he and several of the prisoners keep dogs, which nuisance should never be permitted in prisons. The billiard and missisippi tables are now put down, and the code of laws abolished. In 1783, from July 7, to Aug. 25, not one prisoner was brought in. — Robert Bajfan, a crown prisoner, was committed Nov. 29, 1776, and after the fire surrendered himself under the proclamation Nov. 17, 1781, and was here at

CLERKENWELL BRIDEWELL.

A small close room is used as an infirmary for the men: in Dec. 1782, five were sick and one dying, with little or no covering. Two of the night-rooms are made into one for an infirmary for the women, in which in 1782, there were twelve lying in their clothes on the barrack-bedstead and floor, without any bedding.

This prison was clean, but it is much too small for the number of prisoners. All the rooms are too close: no thorough air. If the ground let for a work-house were taken in, it might be made convenient. — Of the one hundred and seventy-one prisoners in 1779, twenty-two men and boys, and fifty-eight women were convicts. These were employed in picking oakdm, the women in two rooms below, the men up flairs. A warehouse and a shed for drying have been erected on some ground at the back of this prison. Allowance, now one pound of bread a day. The convicts here are allowed three pence a day. Of the one hundred and fifty-five at my visit in Dec. 1782, one hundred and three were fines: all were unemployed. At my last visit twenty men and fifty women were convicts, and employed in picking oakum. There were six debtors from the court of requests.* The justices have reduced the fees from seven shillings to the former sum (five shillings and six pence).

Southwark. THE KING's BENCH PRISON.

Some of the old buildings were taken down, and a chapel and many rooms were added to the new buildings, and another wing similar to that which has been already mentioned, but no infirmary. — This spacious prison was enclosed with a strong wall about thirty feet high, with a chevaux de frise.

Two excellent rules were hung up and enforced.

The above was the account of the prison before it was burnt by the rioters in 1780; and now it is rebuilt on the plan of the former new buildings. No infirmary. Many good regulations are introduced, and a flop is put in a great measure to gaming and the illicit practice of selling spirituous liquors and smuggled goods.

I procured a list of gifts and donations belonging to the prisoners on the common-ftde of the King's Bench prison.

MARSHALSEA PRISON.

[Southwark.]

No alteration. Here the chambers want regulation: for in several rooms where four lie in two beds, and in some dark rooms where two lie in one bed, each pays 3s. 6d. a week for his lodging. — Since the act of the 19th of Geo. III. Cap. LXX. there are not so many debtors in this prison as formerly; yet here and in some other gaols the original debts of several of the prisoners were much under £10, but the exorbitant expences of prosecution have been too often added for the purpose of imprisoning the debtors.

I procured a list of the legacies and donations which are regularly paid, but no table was hung up.

BOROUGH COMPTER.

This gaol was pulled down by the rioters in 1780, and the present prison is an adjoining house hired by the keeper. The court only fourteen feet and a half by eleven. A day-room below (seventeen feet by twelve) stone floor. The men's lodging-room (sixteen feet by fourteen) on the second floor, in which at my last visit there were seventeen, and sometimes there have been two or three and twenty. The women lodge in the common day-room. No bedding. Three or four rooms for those that pay. Debtors here (as in the county gaol, King's Bench, the Fleet, and Marshalsea) have a gift of twenty shillings every Christmas from the archbishop of Canterbury. Allowance a penny loaf a day each, weight Aug. 1779, twelve ounces; Dec. 1782, eight ounces; Aug. 1783, nine ounces and a half. — The Thatched-house society release many debtors from this prison.

[Hertfordshire.]

COUNTY GAOL at HERTFORD.

The new goal has separate wards and courts for debtors, men-felons and women-felons; and the whole is now surrounded by a wall fifteen feet high; which being at a distance from the buildings, the keeper has within it a convenient garden. — The felons looked healthy and well, which I am persuaded was owing to the gaoler's not crowding them into a few rooms. — An obvious defect or two in this new gaol I will just mention, that architects employed in such buildings may not imitate them. The rooms are not vaulted; the corridor is too narrow, but four feet wide; and the pillars not being of stone or circular, make the rooms dark and close. The door-ways are only one foot ten inches wide, so that no crib bedsteads can be introduced.

Home Circuit. HERTFORDSHIRE. 181

[Hertfordshire.]

The two rooms appropriated to the sick are too small. The chapel close. No bath.

In mentioning the gaol fever I should have added, I was well informed that a prisoner in the old gaol brought out as dead, from one of the dungeons, on being washed under the pump, shewed signs of life, and soon after recovered. Since this I have known other instances of the same kind.

No alteration. The debtors from the court of requests are confined here with felons. Though the act of 25th Geo.

He pays rent to the corporation for this prison.

COUNTY GAOL at CHELMSFORD.

Chaplain, Rev. Mr. Morgan. Salary now £50.

The new prison was occupied at the time of my visit in 1779. The debtors rooms are seventeen feet ten inches by fifteen feet three, and nine feet ten high. At one end of their court is a work-room thirty-seven feet and a half by fourteen and a half, and twelve feet five inches high, with a fire-place and four large windows: here many were weaving garters. Over this is their free ward. At the other end of the court is their hall or kitchen, in which clauses against spirituous liquors painted on a board were hung up, and the memorial of Mrs. Herris's legacy, and a new table of fees. The felons rooms (fifteen feet nine inches by fourteen and a half) are lofty, lined with stone and vaulted. Near their court, there are rooms and a small court for the condemned. The women-felons are separated; they have two rooms, a court and a pump. The courts are paved with flat stone. There is a chapel. Only one close room for an infirmary, which, being unfurnished, has never been used, though at my last visit several were sick on the floors. No bath. The felons apartments are entirely out of sight

Home Circuit. ESSEX. 183

[Essex.]

from the gaoler's house; I beg leave to observe, that a window might be made in his kitchen, which would overlook the felons court. The window in the debtors apartment toward the street was highly improper, as an avenue for introducing at all times spirituous liquors, tools, &c. but it is now stopped up. The straw in the felons rooms (as also in the bridewell) is on the floors. Such cribs or cradles as are in the hospital at Plymouth, would be much more conducive to cleanliness and health. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is not hung up: and this gaol has not been white-washed since it was first occupied; a fault too common in new gaols. — The felons are too much crowded at night when some of their rooms are empty.

The new table of fees dated the 5th of October 18th of Geo. III. and signed by Thomas Cowper, James Raymond, and Richard Hunt, Esqrs. and at the Lent assize 1780 at Chelmsford, approved by judge Gould, is the same as the old table; only there is added, "For every felon prisoner, discharged by proclamation, to be paid by the treasurer of the county, £0: 13: 4."

COUNTY GAOL at MAIDSTONE.

No alteration, but the staircase being removed, the chapel is commodious. Allowance to debtors, three chaldron of coals. Clauses of act against spirituous liquors are hung up. Act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. No bath. Without great attention to cleanliness, and the separation of the sick, here will be great danger of the gaol fever, from the offensiveness of the wards, and even the court of the men-felons. The felons six night-rooms have double doors; if one of them was an iron-lattice door (as at the new gaol at Horsham) and locked in the day-time, the rooms would freshen and be better ventilated.

Fees, 3s. 6d. No table; but printed rules, orders and regulations established under the acts of 7th Jam. I. 17th Geo. II. and 22d Geo. III. were hung up in the wards. I saw two with the smallpox, lying on loose straw, and their only covering was common mats.

CANTERBURY CITY BRIDEWELL.

A room in the front court of the work-house. — (This work-house is finely situated, a river running between the two courts: but being an old building, the rooms close, and the cielings low, it cannot be convenient and salutary for the numerous inhabitants.)

1782, Dec. 5, No prisoners.

DARTFORD. Now there are two courts from the keeper's garden, one for each sex, with pumps and sewers, and a room in the men's court for the sick: but the women had no mats, or any sort of bedding. Three dungeons (twelve feet by five) damp and not secure: the floors should be boarded. One prisoner, who had been committed for three months from July 18th, was in December still in confinement for the court fees, 9s. 4d. and the keeper's fees, 3s. 6d. — Committed in 1780, a hundred and seven prisoners; in 1781, ninety-two; and in 1782, a hundred and three.

1782, Dec. 3, Prisoners 5.

ROCHESTER CITY GAOL.

The court-room was built, as appears by the date, in 1687; and it is probable, there has been no alteration in the prison since. The room for debtors in the keeper's house, is only for such as can pay for a bed; for I found two in the close offensive room towards the street, who had been locked up there some weeks.

ROCHESTER CITY BRIDEWELL.

[Kent.]

Two rooms down eight steps, with barrack-bedsteads and draw. Fees, 1s. Keeper's salary, £2; paid out of Mr. Watts's charity. — This bridewell is in a house appointed for the reception of six poor travellers. The design of this charity may be seen from the following inscription placed over the door. "Richard Watts, Esq. by his will dated 22d of August, 1579, founded this charity, for six poor travellers, who, not being rogues or proctors, may receive gratis,for one night, lodging, entertainment, and four pence each."

SANDWICH GAOL and BRIDEWELL.

A room in front; and a back room called the dungeon: above stairs, two rooms. In the court, two new rooms without fire-places.

No court: no water: no sewer. Allowance to criminals, two twopenny loaves a day each. Keeper no salary; fees, 13s. 4d.

1782, Dec. 5, No prisoners.

DEAL GAOL.

A room under the court, only eight feet and a half by six and a half, with a barrack-bedstead. Keeper, town sergeant, lives distant. I did not wonder that a felon had made his escape the night preceding my visit.

1782, Dec. 5, No prisoners.

SUSSEX.

[Sussex.]

COUNTY GAOL at HORSHAM.

The new gaol does credit to the gentlemen that superintended the work: it is every way substantial and strong; and each felon has a separate room, ten feet by seven, and nine feet high to the crown of the arch. They are all arched with brick, to prevent danger and confusion in case of fire. To each room are two doors, one of them iron-latticed.

This gaol has two floors over arcades; the ascent to them is by a stone staircase with iron rails. On each floor, both on the debtors and felons side, there are ten rooms (five on each side a passage five feet wide), besides a day-room (twenty-eight feet by twelve feet three inches), and a lodging-room for a turnkey. Each floor has an iron-latticed door, and every room has a shutter for the window; a bedstead, a canvass straw-bed, and two blankets: and the county is so considerate as to allow a bushel of coals to the debtors, and the same quantity to the felons, every day during the six winter months.

Home Circuit. SUSSEX. 189

[Sussex.]

Here are two spacious courts with water in each; and a wall encloses the whole prison.

The felons on their entrance are washed with warm water, and each man is clothed in a green striped uniform of coat, waistcoat and breeches; and has two shirts, two pair of stockings, a pair of shoes, a hat, and woollen cap.

The county has, very prudently settled the number of turnkeys, (viz. three); to each they pay half a guinea a week; one of them goes twice a day to purchase provisions and liquors for debtors; and it is properly fixed that they shall not exceed one pint of wine, or one quart of strong beer a day each. Felons have only water for their drink. The justices have sent in scales and weights, which is a check on the baker. The felons allowance is now a two-pound loaf, and there was full weight of several which I saw weighed.

The clauses against spirituous liquors are hung up; and the gaol is kept very clean. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is not hung up. I would just observe, that the gaoler should have a window in his kitchen towards the debtors court, and in his parlour towards that of the felons.

The gaoler's salary now is £100. Chaplain, the Rev. Mr. Jameson: salary, £50. Sermon once a week, prayers every day.

This county has set a noble example of abolishing all fees, and also the tap: in consequence of this, I found the gaol as quiet as a private house.

LEWES. No alteration. The apartments for each sex similar, but separate; a kitchen, five bed-rooms ten feet square, work-shop, court, &c. Though I found no prisoners at work, but as there were chalk, mallets, sieves, &c. in the men's work-room, it seems they are sometimes employed in making whiting. The keeper has all the profits of their work. The county allowance is three halfpence in bread (weight in Dec. 1782, thirteen ounces). The keeper's house is detached, so that he has no view from thence into the rooms or courts of the prison. Surgeon Mr. Turner.

COUNTY GAOL in SOUTHWARK.

[Surrey.]

A chapel and two close rooms for the sick, were lately built on the vacant ground where formerly was the house of correction, but after the riots in 1780, were used for a bridewell, till that in George's Fields was rebuilt. At my last visit the chapel was fitted up, and the two small rooms for an infirmary; these are on the ground-floor, only one window in each. Many were sick on the dirty floors: one of the turnkeys had lately died of a fever. Of the fifty-five felons &c. in Oct. 1783; I have the names and the sentences of twenty-five convicts, who are left languishing in this sickly gaol.

The felons courts should be paved with flat stones, not only for the convenience of washing, but for safety, as pebbles are dangerous. In the men's court there should be a pump, and a convenient bath: at several of my visits the Thames water was off. — Bread allowance, weight Aug. 1779, seventeen ounces; Dec. 1782, thirteen ounces; Sept. 1783, thirteen ounces and a half. — Surgeons now, Stapleton and Walshman.

Here I would just mention, that all the rags left by the felons after every assize, ought to be immediately burned, or rather buried; as they only serve to harbour vermin, dirt, and infection.

GEORGE'S FIELDS. The fines or convicts are with the other prisoners, and have the same allowance. All are entirely without employment.* — This prison was burnt by the rioters in 1780, and (as appears by the inscription in front) rebuilt in 1781. It is nearly on the same plan: in the men's court there are now added four rooms, planked round,

* I observed in Clerkenwell bridewell, the convicts were employed in picking oakum, as I have seen in some houses of correction near the sea shore. This is a salutary employment, as the strong scent of the pitch and tar may counteract any contagious or unhealthy effluvia in the work-rooms. - If the great quantities of old cables and ropes piled up at the Tower were delivered out to the several keepers of bridewells in and about London, to be wrought for use, and prompt payment made for the work; this, would prevent the excuses of keepers for not employing their prisoners.

(nine feet eight inches by five and a half, and seven feet four inches high,) very proper for the separation of the drunken and riotous. In each of the work-rooms (so called) there is a chimney. There are now two rooms for faulty apprentices. No bath. — Bread allowance, weight Dec. 1782, thirteen ounces; Aug. 1783, fourteen ounces; and Oct. 29, fourteen ounces and a half. Keeper now no licence. The clauses against spirituous liquors, act for preserving the health of prisoners, and the table of fees, not hung up. At my late visits the prison very dirty, and the prisoners still without employment. At night they are crowded into one or two rooms, as all the upper rooms are kept for the few that can pay for beds. I released a young man for his fees (4s. 2d.)

KINGSTON upon Thames. The prison was dirty, and the prisoners unemployed; the keeper informing me, that they were not committed for hard labour, though one was imprisoned for a year. No bath. The three halfpenny loaf in 1779 weighed seventeen ounces and a quarter; in 1782, twelve ounces; and in 1783, fourteen ounces. The act for preserving the health of prisoners was hung up; at the bottom of the board was also painted, "N. B. The fees for each person are 3s. 4d."

As the county allows no firing, bedding or bedsteads, many were lying sick on the floors. One woman was in a bed on the men's side, and two women in the room for faulty apprentices, but they pay for this privilege. There is a door from the men's court into that of the women's, and one of the men keeps the key, and can let any of the prisoners into the women's apartments.

As I had been the preceding morning at Horsham gaol, where proper humanity is shewn even to felons; I was the more struck at seeing the wretched condition of these prisoners. — The surgeon's salary is £10: 10: 0, of which £5: 5: 0. is for travelling charges, to report at the quarter sessions the state of the prisoners.

For every debtor for each week's lodging on the chapel side, the gaoler finding bed, sheets and blankets - O 2 6

* I have mentioned the necessity of an allowance of firing in bridewells, but perhaps have not sufficiently insisted on it in gaols. I therefore take occasion here to observe, that this is not only what humanity demands in our climate, but that it is essential to the preservation of the health of prisoners, by promoting the circulation of air, and preventing those mortifications of the feet to which they are so liable. I well know, that the want of firing joined to scanty provision has been the cause of great mortality in our prisons during the winter.

In the spring 1779, seventeen women were confined in the day-time, and some of them at night, in the work-room, which has no fire-place or sewer. This made it extremely offensive, and occasioned a fever or sickness among them, which alarmed the Vice-chancellor, who ordered all of them to be discharged: two or three of them died within a few days.

The wards are kept clean by frequent washing, and airy by the opposite windows being generally open. There are Dutch stoves in the wards in summer, and little coppers for tea-water, with which the patients are sometimes (properly) indulged. There is a fine area enclosed, in which the patients walk.

Here are no alterations, but the water from the pump conveyed through the sewers, which prevents the court-yard which is small, from being offensive; and there is allowance to the gaoler for conveying prisoners to Bury. — The memorial of Mr. Pemberton's legacy is now hung up in the chapel.

At this, the annual meeting of the trustees of Mr. Pemberton's charity, it is ordered that the treasurer should provide as the trustees shall see fit, for the debtors imprisoned in any of the jails in the county of Suffolk, either for their relief therein, by a proportion of bread, meat, and beer, as he shall think necessary, or for the delivering them out of prison, untill the treasurer shall receive further orders. — Nevertheless, such debtors in Ipswich jail, as do not regularly attend divine service (unless prevented by sickness, or some reasonable cause, to be allowed of by the chaplain,) and behave decently and reverently, shall not have any benefit or allowance from this charity.

Here were upwards of forty persons in 1779, and at my last visit sixty-nine, whose countenances bespoke their satisfaction and the attention paid to them. If all the parishes had been as careful to promote cleanliness and industry in their own work-houses, there would have been no occasion for parishes uniting in houses of industry, most of which I have visited in this and the adjoining county.

WARWICKSHIRE.

COUNTY GAOL AT WARWICK.

[Warwickshire.]

The justices of this county have taken the gaol and bridewell under consideration, and propose that debtors and felons, and also men and women, in both, shall be entirely separated. A chapel and infirmary also are designed. May it not be hoped that gentlemen so considerate will not continue the damp and offensive dungeon, which has only an aperture level with the court, of three feet diameter. In 1782, many rooms for debtors were finished, which open into passages only three feet wide. By what is done it seems that the plan is adapted more for shew, than for security, health, or convenience.

There were hung up in the debtors hall some rules against profaneness, rioting, and drunkenness, with penalties annexed; but I was sorry to find among them that "Every debtor at his or her first coming must pay for garnish 2s. 6d." — At my last visit I was informed there had been no divine service, except to the condemned, for near two years.

COVENTRY CITY and COUNTY GAOL.

No alteration in the gaol, but a table of fees is now hung up. Many rooms might be made for criminals in the adjoining old county-hall; in which case the damp unhealthy dungeons need not be used, and the sexes might be separated. — One of the felons, James Ward, received his majesty's pardon, on condition of his going to sea. Mr. Francis, clerk of the assize, wrote in the letter which inclosed the pardon (which was dated Aug. 25, 1781) "The secretary of state's fee is £1: 7: 0, and my fee £1: 1: 0, which you'll take care to receive on the back of the pardon from the officer who receives him." As no officer would take him on condition of paying this, together with 19s. 4d. the gaoler's and under-sheriff's fees, I found the poor wretch in May 1782, languishing in prison on his pound of bread a day.

COUNTY GAOL at LEICESTER.

No alteration, but an inscription on a board is fixed over the gate, "No money to be asked for by turnkeys or prisoners, for garnish or any other pretence whatever."

It was remarked in my former work, that "the situation of the gaol is so confined, that it cannot be made convenient or healthy." But I might have hinted, that the Castle hill is near the shire-hall, and is a fine spot for air and water. Here, as in many other gaols, is an useless tub, instead of a bath, for cleanliness and health. — I am sorry to find the collection for the prisoners fall short. It amounted in 1779 only to £12: 5: 6. - 1780, £6: 1: 9. 1781, £3: 18: 0.

In the prison is painted on a board: "By order of the court at Easter sessions 1778, that there shall be no ale or beer brought into this prison on a Sunday, nor after 7 o'clock in the evening on a week day."

In a former edition I suggested that if a wall were built with brick, instead of the clay wall, there would be no need for a chain and a log, to secure the prisoners in the court. The apartments also would be more airy, and men and women might be separated, if the narrow court were

enlarged from the orchard, which was let by the keeper for annum. — At my last visit I found the court enlarged, and a wall built; but there is not a proper separation of men and women. The prisoners now are without the chain. This prison is white-washed once a year, and kept remarkably neat and clean. The prisoners do not lie on the floors, but very properly, their mats are on cribs or bedsteads. Committed from Easter sessions 1779 to 1780, forty-four - 1780 to 1781, fifty-nine - 1781 to 1782, forty-eight.

[Berkshire.]

Carlisle. There seems the same ground of complaint with respect to the present table being defaced. As the fees are lower here than in most other prisons, the table should be preserved to prevent impositions. At my last visit I found that the old keeper had been murdered in the tap-room by a soldier, who also killed another, and was then shot himself. This is not the first instance which I have known of persons being murdered in the tap-room of gaols. Such are the bad effects of selling liquors in prisons.

COUNTY GAOL, OXFORD CASTLE.

[Oxfordshire.]

Chaplain now Rev. Mr. Cotton.

It is very probable, that the rooms in this castle are the same as the prisoners occupied at the time of the Black Assize. The wards are close and offensive; so that if crowded, I should not greatly wonder to hear of another fatal assize at Oxford. At my last visit some of the debtors rooms were white-washed. The felons day-room is paved with flat stones in consequence of their taking up the pebbles for defence, after an attempt to escape. For the same reason, their court should be thus paved. — Of the thirty-one felons &c. 1782, fifteen were fines.

WITNEY. At my visit in 1779 the prisoners were at work: the keeper now is a manufacturer, and employs them. He pays them for their work, two pence a pound for the chain, and three halfpence for the shoot, so that each earns about three pence a day. At my last visit I found a room built for men (sixteen feet and a half by twelve and a half) in which there are two cells (seven feet by four and a half) with apertures in the doors nine inches square. Up stairs are two rooms for the sick (nine feet two inches by eight feet four, and six feet five inches high,) with only apertures in the doors of fourteen inches by twelve. No chimney. To this prison were committed, in 1779, fifty-one;- in 1780, thirty-six;- in 1781, thirty-eight.

1782, Dec. 26, Prisoners 4.

WORCESTERSHIRE.

COUNTY GAOL, WORCESTER CASTLE.

[Worcestershire.]

The castle-yard is raised and gravelled. A workman for a guinea a year keeps the hand-ventilator in repair. A larger and more convenient room is now fitted up for a chapel. I found the debtors apartments very clean. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is written on paper, and hung up.

The magistrates may be fully convinced of the impropriety and indecency of having only one day-room, if they examine the women sent from this gaol to the bridewell. — At my last visit I found the gaol-fever prevailing, which had carried off some of the prisoners, the gaoler, and Dr. Johnson, a physician, whose humanity had led him to attend the prison. Two rooms were taken from the bridewell for the sick, who lay in their clothes on straw. At my request, the irons of those who were ill were taken off.

The uneasy situation of the prisoners at night in the horrid dungeon, has, I doubt not, been one cause of their illness; for even in this strong and deep dungeon, prisoners (as in too many other gaols) are all night chained together, by a heavy chain through the links in their fetters and iron rings fastened to the floor.*

* My mind reverts to an admirable thought of Mr. Eden's; Principles of Penal Law, p. 330. "A very slight reflexion, on the numberless unforeseen events which a day may bring forth, will be sufficient to shew that we are all liable to the imputation of guilt; and consequently all interested, not only in the protection of innocence, but in the assignment to every particular offence, of the smallest punishment compatible with the safety of society."

No alteration. The debtors court and free-ward are spacious; in the latter is a hand-ventilator for the felons dungeon, which being out of repair, has not been used for many years: were the county to allow a guinea a year, it might be kept in order, as is done in castle. An alarm-bell in this crowded gaol would be very proper. — Only day-room for men and women felons, down three steps (fifteen feet by twelve and six feet three inches high). Act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. No infirmary: no bath.

Mr. Hughes (now the surgeon) is apothecary to the county infirmary, which is near the gaol. He receives £8 of the £20 allowed by the county, and the remaining £12 is paid to the infirmary for drugs.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at SHREWSBURY.

Here is a new work-room. Half a hundred of coals is allowed weekly from Michaelmas to the Lent assize. This is the only house of correction for the county. The gaol being too small and enclosed with buildings, and the windows of the bridewell opening into the courts of the gaol, if the whole were converted into a house of correction, every convenience might be made for labour and solitary confinement. A new gaol might then be built that would do credit to the County.

COUNTY BRIDEWELL at HEREFORD.

1779, May 17. The prisoners were in the county gaol, and they were repairing this prison, for the cross-wall had fallen in. But the spot on which it is built is so confined, that it cannot be convenient. Only two rooms for work and lodging for both sexes (twenty-two feet nine inches by twenty-one) no chimney; no straw; and as there is no court, the sewers must make these rooms very unhealthy. It is a slight building: the prisoners in irons. If the gentlemen had thought of building the bridewell in one of the two spacious gardens adjoining to the county gaol, and occupied by the gaoler; then, if they had no chapel, the prisoners (as those in Shrewsbury bridewell) might have the privilege of public worship in the county gaol.

GLOCESTERSH1RE.

COUNTY GAOL, GLOCESTER CASTLE.

[Glocestershire.]

Eight prisoners died about Christmas 1778, of the smallpox. No proper separation of the sexes, or of the bridewell prisoners from the rest. From the magistrates inattention to this important point, there is the most licentious intercourse; and all the endeavours of the chaplain to promote reformation, must necessarily be defeated, where the most abandoned are daily encouraging the others in vice. Many children have been born in this gaol.

Eleven of the twenty-four felons in 177 9, and sixteen in 1782, were fines without any allowance. Clauses against spirituous liquors, and the act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. At my visit in 1782 I found some improvements: the floors laid with stone; boxes or bedsteads for the felons and fines; and the whole prison white-washed. The windows (improperly) were close glazed. Numbers of the townsmen were drinking in the tap-room. — Surgeons, Messrs. Powell and Mills. In 1783, several died of the smallpox and gaol-fever. No bath; one like that in the county hospital with an easy descent would induce felons even with their irons to go in. This would freshen and revive them, and might be the means of preventing the

gaol-fever. I was happy to hear in Oct. 1783, that this county has determined to build a new gaol, and to reform the bridewells; which is principally owing to the spirited exertions of the chairman of the grand jury Sir George Oness. Paul.

NEWPORT in the Isle of Wight. The bridewell for twenty-eight parishes: and the town gaol, are now both in the old work-house, four rooms being appropriated to that purpose. No bedding: no chimney. There are two keepers, one for the county bridewell, whose salary is £19: 15: 0, the other for the gaol, whose salary is £3. Neither the act for preserving the health of prisoners, nor clauses against spirituous liquors are hung up. — The poor are removed to a house of industry, built in the forest of Partchurst, near Newport, for the twenty-nine parishes or whole island. Eighty acres of land statute measure, was a grant from the crown, to the guardians of the poor, March 21, 1772, for nine hundred and ninety-nine years at the yearly rent of £8: 17: 9.* At my last visit there were sixty-five men, a hundred and fifty women, a hundred and fifty-five boys, and a hundred and forty-six girls. The house was neat and clean, and those lodging-rooms were fresh which had apertures in the cielings (eighteen inches by

twelve). The women's sick-ward (twenty-eight feet wide) was quite clean, and the beds were not crowded.*

The principal work of the house was making aacks, besides there were tailors and shoe-makers employed. The provisions were good; the girls and boys were clean, a set of fine healthy children.

The oeconomy of giving them (especially the elderly people) no more of their earnings than one penny in the shilling, is not for the advantage of the house. — Here is a fault, (which is common in such buildings) that the dining-hall, work-rooms and bed-rooms are all too low. — In the passages, &c. of such houses, all expedients should be used to promote the circulation of air.

* I observed an excellent contrivance in the windows of the women's sick-ward. By a small hasp in the upper sash and staples in the frames, when the sash is in part, or entirely down; a padlock prevents the nurses or patients putting it immediately up, as they generally do in the county hospitals, and at Plymouth, and Haslar, when the medical gentlemen leave the rooms. Dr. Lind told me, that in summer time he nails some of the sashes down.

† I went over the poor-house in this town, where there are some good rules and orders; I copy the last (the twenty-fourth). "That these orders be publicly read once a week, that no one may pretend to plead ignorance thereof." — I shall take this opportunity to make an observation respecting the conduct of these houses, which I think of importance. It is well known that the grown-up inhabitants of these places will do no more work than they are absolutely compelled to perform, and are full of contrivances to excuse themselves from labour. Their precepts and example cannot fail of having a very mischievous effect upon the children who associate with them. On this account, besides a separation of the different sexes, I would recommend a total separation of all children above seven years of age, from the adults. The want of this, I am persuaded, is the reason why so few good and industrious servants come out of poor-houses.

DEVIZES. The weight of bread allowance, in 1779, was one pound and a half, and in 1782, fourteen ounces. A window is now made in the keeper's kitchen, which overlooks the court. The prisoners are without employment; the shutters of the work-room up. No fees are demanded of the prisoners; the magistrates of the county pay the gaoler seven shillings and eight-pence for each. In 1779, here were three distracted persons, one man and two women. — In 1782, a weaver who

MARLBOROUGH. No alteration. The keeper's salary, which was raised from £20 to £50, is to supply the prisoners with bread, as the county pays for the fees, seven shillings and eight pence at the discharge of every prisoner. In 1779 I found no prisoners at work. One of them said, with evident concern, that "he had been there thirty weeks and had not earned one halfpenny." In 1782 also there was no employment: on asking the prisoners, if they desired to work; they readily answered in the affirmative. One or two said, their wives had brought them wool, but the keeper would not permit them to spin it.

No bath. No alteration in this crowded and offensive gaol; yet, as an elegant shire-hall is now finished, may it not be hoped that the gentlemen will turn their thoughts to the gaol, especially the proprietor, who (in 1782) liberally subscribed £1000 to encourage seamen to enter into his majesty's fleet? Surgeon now Mr. Walker.

This prison is now discontinued, and the prisoners are sent to the new county gaol.

* Near Plymouth is an hospital for sick and hurt seamen, different from other royal foundations of this kind, as it consists of several detached buildings. In each of them are six spacious wards, and every patient has a cradle and bed, several of which beds have hair mattresses: these cradles (made of oak) are fourteen inches from the floor; six feet two inches long, and three feet one inch wide in the clear. These may be made of cast-iron, nearly as cheap as oak. I could wish there were similar cradles in all prisons, particularly in the sick-rooms. — I give a plan of this hospital; omitting two buildings, which I think improperly placed.

Here is a good house for the gaoler, in which there are apartments for the master-side debtors, and a chapel. There are separate rooms and courts for each of debtors, of felons, and also of petty offenders or bridewell prisoners; and each prisoner has a separate lodging-room (about eight feet two inches by five feet eight inches, and seven feet and a half high), which is furnished with a bedstead, straw-bed, two blankets and a coverlet. - There are two rooms for an infirmary, and under them three condemned cells. In two of the courts

are baths. — In the centre of the gaoler's house there is a turret with an alarm-bell and clock. — The men who are confined for petty offences, are employed in sawing and polishing stone, and (as they have the county allowance) have only one sixth of what they earn. Clauses against spirituous liquors are hung up. The act for preserving the health of prisoners is not hung up, but the gaol is kept very neat and clean. — By a spirited exertion, the gentlemen of this county have erected a monument of their humanity, and attention to the health and morals of prisoners.*

I had the pleasure to find six cells made in the upper stable, ten feet by six feet eight inches, each having an aperture about two feet by one and a half; one of these cells has an inscription over the door, denoting, that it is appropriated to drunken and riotous debtors. There are two good rooms fitted up for an infirmary in the dungeon tower. At my last visit, here were three new cells (ten feet by six and a half), having two doors to each, one of which was iron-latticed. Here was also a separate closet for women, which is generally wanted in gaols. The debtors rooms were white-washed, and casements put in their windows; and the yard lowered and paved. The whole gaol is kept very clean. The act for preserving the health of prisoners, and the clauses against spirituous liquors hung up very conspicuously. Surgeon now Mr Wright. Salary, £10: 10: 0. An order for attending divine service is hung up in the shire-hall. — Much good, I hope, may be expected from the exertions now making by the gentlemen of this county, for the further improvement of their prisons.

In the table of fees, the two last articles were erased, and there is now inserted; Crown prisoners to pay no fees. John Higgin, Gaoler.

At the general quarter session of the peace held at Lancaster in and for the said county palatine of Lancaster, the 15th day of July in the seventeenth year of king George the third's reign; whereas, it appears to this court on the representation of the keeper of the goal or the castle of Lancaster, that several prisoners in his custody, being members of the Church of England and having no lawful excuse, make a common practice of absenting themselves from divine service performed in the said goal, and misbehaving themselves during service. It is therefore ordered by this court, that if any prisoner or prisoners confined in the said castle (except Roman Catholics and Quakers) and having no lawful excuse, shall absent him her or themselves, from attending divine service within the said castle, or shall in any way misbehave, such prisoner or prisoners shall immediately be deprived of the county allowance until further orders to the contrary. And it is further ordered, that the treasurer of the said county stock, shall immediately upon receiving a complaint from the said keeper against any prisoner or prisoners to strike his her or their name or names out of his books, and to forbear to pay such prisoner or prisoners any more money until further order.

LIVERPOOL BRIDEWELL.

This prison was built in 1776. The men and women have separate rooms, courts, &c. The women have six rooms below, and the same number above: the men have four rooms below, and four above. These are twelve feet by ten, and eight feet nine inches high; are furnished with bedsteads, blankets and coverlets; but are too close, having no window, only an aperture in the door about nine inches square, and another near the cieling. They have a work-room, twenty feet by sixteen feet nine inches. Near this room in the men's court is a pump, to which the women are tied every week and receive discipline. In this court is also a bath, with a new and singular contrivance. At one end of it was a standard for a long pole, at the extremity of which was fastened a chair. In this all the females (not the males) at their entrance, after a few questions, were placed, with a flannel shift on, and underwent a thorough ducking, thrice repeated — an use of a bath which I dare say the legislature never thought of, when in their late act they ordered baths with a view to cleanliness and preserving the health of prisoners; not for the exercise of a wanton and dangerous kind of severity. But I was glad to find this use of the bath has been discontinued since my visit in 1779. The severe weekly discipline of the women in the men's court is still continued. — This prison is kept remarkably clean by the matron. All the prisoners were employed in

By the Court.

W. Widdens, Clerk of the peace for the said county of Chester.

NANTWICH TOWN GAOL.

This prison (called the round-house) was built by the county in 1782. Two rooms and a kitchen for the keeper. For prisoners, a room arched with brick (twelve feet three inches by ten feet two) with a barrack-bedstead: no chimney: no court. Down twelve steps two dungeons with apertures twelve inches by nine. — The gentlemen seem to have overlooked a clause in the act of 14th Geo. III. Cap. XLIII. — "to prevent the prisoners from being kept under ground, whenever they can do it conveniently." The water has been eighteen inches high in these dungeons.

1782, Nov. 23, No prisoners.

The county has furnished each of the debtors rooms with an two chairs, a table, and a fender, and each cell with a bedstead, two blankets and a coverlet. Here are separate courts for debtors and criminals; in each a pump, with excellent water, and a bathing-room, with a copper &c. made so convenient that they are in constant use.

MONTGOMERYSHIRE.

COUNTY GAOL at MONTGOMERY.

[Montgomeryshire.]

A large brewhouse is built for the gaoler. There might be a room over it for a chapel, much more convenient than that now used. Act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. The gaol has been but once white-washed since the act passed. No bath, though very conveniently situated for plenty of water. Debtors are sent from the county court for small sums, and no term is fixed for their discharge, as is generally ordered in the acts for the courts of requests. One was confined here for £1: 11: 6, costs: £1: 1: 11, exclusive of the gaoler's fee. The gaoler said, many had been committed for much less sums. Allowance now a six penny loaf from the gaoler, every other day. Surgeon, Mr. Stephens. Salary, £8.

In 1780 this gaol was altered much for the better. It has five rooms and a court for debtors, and a court for felons. There are three bed-rooms, and a day-room (twenty-one feet by fourteen and a half) with a fire-place for men-felons, and a day-room, in which there is a small night-room, for women-felons. The keeper's window is properly towards the felons court. No water: no straw: the act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up.

PEMBROKESHIRE.

COUNTY GAOL at HAVERFORDWEST.

[Pembrokeshire.]

A new gaol is now built within the walls of the old castle. Here are five cells and a kitchen for felons, and a bridewell room for men; and five rooms over them for debtors, and a room called the women's bridewell. The cells are twelve feet by six feet nine inches, and open into a passage four feet wide. These cells being four feet under ground, and damp, makes it almost absolutely

Carmarthen Circuit. PEMBROKESHIRE, &c. 267

[Pembrokeshire.]

necessary to have bedsteads. Here is a chapel: but there is no infirmary or bath. There is a fine well of water in the spacious court. A pump is necessary; for wells and ropes are dangerous in gaols. Neither the act for preserving the health of prisoners, nor clauses against spirituous liquors were hung up.

Mrs. Martha Bowen declared in her will, that £100 had been deposited in her hands by an unknown person, about the year 1751, for the benefit of insolvent debtors, and the poor: which said sum of £100 was invested in new South Sea annuities in trust to the rectors of St. Mary's Haverfordwest. The present rector, the Rev. Mr. Charles very wisely distributes the interest in bread every week, a sixpenny loaf to each poor debtor, and the remainder in twopenny loaves to the poor in the town.

RADNORSHIRE.

[Radnorshire.]

COUNTY GAOL at PRESTEIGN.

This gaol is much improved. Besides the keeper's apartments, there are now five rooms and a hall for debtors, two of which (eighteen feet by twelve) are new, but no free ward; a cell for criminals (eleven feet and a half by six), and a day-room. No straw. A damp dungeon down three steps, which I hope is never used. The bridewell room (eleven feet and a half by ten and a half) has no window. The keeper's garden is now taken into the court, but debtors are not separated from felons. There are still wanting, two rooms for criminals, an infirmary and bath, and casements to the windows, they being all close glazed. The act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up. Gaoler's salary, £5: 5: 0, now £10.

A day-labourer, who had a wife and three small children, was confined here from the county-court, for a debt of only 9s. costs, 6s. 8d. gaoler's fee, 3s. 4d.

BRECONSHIRE.

[Breconshire.]

COUNTY GAOL at BRECON.

At my visit in 1779, a new gaol and bridewell was building out of the town, near the river, and I observed that the situation was too low, so that sometimes it may be exposed to floods. In 1782 it was finished. There are five rooms above for debtors, two of which are free wards: a day-room for felons (twenty-six feet and a half by fourteen), into which two cells open,

South Wales Circuit. BRECONSHIRE. 269

[Breconshire.]

and in the front-court a lodging-room. In another court there are five rooms or cells, about six feet and a half by four and a half, and eight feet high.

For women there is a separate court, a day-room and five lodging-rooms. Two rooms for the sick. A chapel with a bell over it. The courts are properly paved with flag-stones. The water has been three feet high in the cells by a great flood, but some precautions are taken to prevent it for the future. This new gaol is not kept clean; fowls and dogs were in the courts. Felons allowance now one pound and a half of bread each. Chaplain's salary now £15: service on Sunday, Wednesday and Friday. Here were hung up printed clauses from three acts of parliament made for the regulation of prisons: and also, the following rules for the Breconshire gaol.

I know not how to close this account of prisons without making the following observation. In all my journies, by night and day, through all the different counties of England (for eleven years past), I have never once been stopped, or even known myself in any great danger from robbers. I mention this, with a devout acknowledgment of a kind Providence; and because foreigners, in this country generally travel in terror, and often give dismal accounts of the dangers they have encountered.

Qu'aucun des prisonniers ose insulter, menacer, maltraiter, & encore moins frapper le guichetier, ni personne par l'Agent employè aux affaires de la prison, sous peine de la punition qu'ordonneront Messieurs les Commissaires, et de perdre leur tour d'être echangés; detre etroitement enfermés, et privés de la moitié de leur vivres.

II. Tous les prisonniers, lors que l'agent en sera la revùe, repondront à leurs noms; et si dans la liste donnée à l'agent quelque erreur se trouve, ils l'indiqueront, afin de la corriger; et ainsi prévoir la confusion qui resulteroit des méprises des noms.

III. Tous les prisonniers refusants de répondre à leurs noms à la revùe, seront punis par la privation de leurs vivres, jusqu' à ce qu'ils s'y soumettent.

IV. S'il arrive du dommage aux lieu où les prisonniers seront gardés, soit en voulant s'echapper, ou autrement, de propos délibéré; les frais de la reparation seront payés des vivres de ceux qui aúront ainsi contrevenu; et si les coupables ne peuvent être decouverts, tous les prisonniers ensemble contribueront de leurs vivres, aux frais de cette réparation.

V. Quiconque s'échappera de prison, étant répris, y sera mis au cachot; et n'y aura que demi-ration de vivres, jusqu' à ce qu'il aura ainsi payé les frais faits pour le saisir et le ramener; et de plus il perdra son tour d'èchange; un officier ainsi contrevenant, sera dés-lors regardé et traite comme simple matelot.

VI. Il est dèfendu de se battre, se quereller, ou faire désordre dans les prisons, ou aux endroits où il sera permis aux prisonniers de prendre l'air, sous peine de punition selon que l'offence l'exigera.

VII. Les prisons seront tenues nettes & propres par les matelots, et cela tour á tour, comme l'agent l'ordonnera; & tout matelot qui refusera ce service á son tour, & qui en aura été averti, sera prive de ses vivres jusque' á ce qu'il s'y foumette.

TABLES. 277

VIII.  Les prisonniers doivent informer l'agent, des hardes, ou autres choses dont ils peuvent avoir besoin, et pour lesquels ils auront dequoi payer; et l'agent a ordre non seulement de permettre qu'ils en soient fournis, mais aussi d'avoir un soin tout particulier, qu'on ne leur en impose dans les prix.

IX. Dans chaque prison les prisonniers pourront nommer trois, ou cing d'entre eux, et les changer quand il leur plaira, pour l'examen des vivres; afin de voir s'ils font bons, & s'ils ont leur ration, soit pour le poids, soit pour la mésure; suivant la table d'avituaillement ci-dessous. Et s'il se trouve quelque sujet de plainte, soit sur la manière de les appretêr, servir, ou dans quelqu'autre chose; ils doivent, avec bienséance, le faire savoir à l'agent; qui, trouvant la plainte fondée, doit immediatement y mettre ordre. S'il le neglige, ils doivent en avertir Messieurs les Commissaires, qui ne manqucront pas de leur rendre justice, á tous égards.

X. Les boutiquiers (excepté ceux qui trafiquent dans des choses qu'il ne convient pas de vendre à des prisonniers,) seront permis de rester à la grande porte, depuis dix heures du matin jusqu' à trois heures de l'apres midi, pour vendre leur merchandises, à tels prisonniers, qui sont en fonds pour les payer sur le champ.

XI. Celui d'entre les prisonniers qui ofera par ce moyen procurer des liqueurs, ou autre choses &ca. qui ne conviennent pas a ùn prisonnier d'avoir, ou qui recevra, oú livrera aucune lettre, sera puni de l'abus qu'il aura salt de cette indulgence.

I have in my possession the large copper plate, first published in 1772 by Sir Stephen Theodore Janssen, shewing the numbers executed in London for the twenty-three preceding years; and the crimes for which they suffered. I am sorry to be reminded by these tables of a judicious observation of Mr. Eden's, Principles of Penal Law, page 306. "The accumulation of sanguinary laws is the worst distemper of a state. Let it not be supposed, that the extirpation of mankind is the chief object of legislation." I would wish, that no persons might suffer capitally but for murder; — for setting houses on fire; — for house breaking, attended with acts of cruelty. The highwayman; — the footpad; — the habitual thief, and people of this clan; should end their days in a penitentiary house, rather than on the gallows.

TABLE IV.

An Account of the Number of Prisoners in the Gaols and Prisons of England and Wales, at the Time they were visited in 1779, and 1782.

As some County gaols are also the county bridewells, where petty offenders are not always separated from felons; in those places I sometimes include petty offenders under the article felons &c. The reason of my distinguishing the women debtors, is to shew that a room or two in the gaoler's house may probably be sufficient for them, instead of a separate ward, as proposed in my general plan for a county gaol (edit. 1.) — In this table I have omitted mentioning all those prisons in which, at the times of my visiting, there were no persons confined.
