A NARRATIVE

Of the late Dreadful BATTELS.

IN this Age of more than Athenian Curiosity, when prating of Affairs of State and publick Occurrences, is become so much the Mode, that people can scarce meet together at Church, without inquiring what News abroad, I thought it might be a grateful discovery to publish the Transactions between these two mighty Empires; in whose Traverses of War, the vulgar Reader, I am confident, is as much concerned, as in some others that have cost him many a dish of Tatling-Broth, and ounce of Sot-weed; and therefore cannot with any colour of Reason grudge the expence of this other odd Twopence for such important Intelligence.

The Prince de l'Or, may justly be accounted one of the most redoubted Potentates on earth. His Hereditary Dominions were anciently the East and West Indies, but of late he hath attempted an Universal Monarchy in Christendome: 'tis he that Creates Cardinals at Rome, he that dubs Knights at Malta; nay, 'tis he admits even Senators at Venice, and Brethren into the pretended Society of Jesus. Most Kingdomes and States court his Alliance, and the Pope himself is more than suspected to be his Pensioner. His Subjects, though not exceeding Numerous, are very powerful, Haughty, Ambitious, desirous of Glory, and notable Politicians; hardly drawn to venture into dangers, but when once engaged, full of a thousand Intrigues and Stratagemes to preserve their Interests: and what they obtain, you may be sure they will keep, which (let me tell you) is one of the best points of a right valiant Souldier.

Would you know who are oppose so puissant and formidable a Monarch? 'Tis that warlike Tamberlain, Mendicoso Duke of Ragland, Son of the Invincible Empress Necessity, famous through the World for his Courage, and Ability to endure

[3]

the fatigues of Want and Hardship: His people far exceed the other in Multitudes, but are rude, unarmed, and without Discipline; yet ingenious, (for Wit is properly a Native of this Country, but thrives best in t'other) full of Inventions, naturally quarrelsome, repining, audacious and greedy to engage the Adversary: for none are so apt for Stirs and Commotions, as those that have nothing to lose.

The Dominions of these two Grandees lye intermixt, rather than bordering; and have continual need of Commerce with, and Supplies from each other: and yet it has been observed, That in all Ages there have been Irreconcileable Fewds, heart-burnings, and secret Animosities between them. Several Treaties and Leagues of Peace they have had, which all proved (as is usual in such cases) only convenient Ambuscades for better opportunities of War: For it is a Dotage equal to the belief of Charms, to imagine, That a few weak Words can blunt the edge of a keen Sword, or binde the powerful beyond their Interest, anymore than a twined thread could fetter Sampson.

But of late sturdier Differences have arose, and Complaints grown more thick and loud on either side; so that both Parties resolved for open War, as the only Salve for open wrong. Poverty (for that Heralds finde to be the most antient Title of our Duke of Ragland) having in his Train so many Poets, and small Philosophers, could not want a Manifesto of his Grievances drawn up after the best Fashion; setting forth,

That whereas by antient Fundamental Laws, the Favourites of Riches were obliged to protect and relieve his gasping and tattered Offspring; their breasts were now swelled with Pride and Covetousness, proportionably as their Coffers with Treasures: So that those Cubs of Fortune (blinde as their Dam) not only withdrew such accustomed Auxiliaries, but likewise had committed many Outrages on his Subjects and Confederates, having lately murdered one of his ancient and most dear Allies, called Hospitality, by driving a Coach full of Ladies and six horses over him; and destroyed another named Charity, by banishing him from their Gates into the wide world, where he was frozen to death, or, as some say, eaten up

[ 4 ]

by a Kennel of Hounds. Besides all this, they had studied so many Stratagems, of Usury, Extortion, Procuration, Continuation, Racking of Rents, Monopolizing and Ingrossing Commodities, pinching Labourers of their Wages, beating down the prices of Manufactures, snapping of Forfeitures, and screwing up an advantage from poor Tradesmens necessities, as had cut all the Nerves of Industry, and left the poor Souls onely a Choice worse than Hobson's, viz. Famine, Gallows, or Whipping-post; take which they have most fancy for.

On the other side, Riches ( or the Prince De l'Or, if you please, all's one in the Original) was not behind-hand in a Declaration: For those that have Money shall never want mercenary Advocates amongst the Book-men to justifie the worst of their Actions.

He set forth at large the Insolence of these Ragged Complainants - "That they were the Pest of Society, the Scandal of Government, the Vermine that consum'd the Body Politick; that abandoning themselves to Laziness and Beggery, they liv'd upon the Spoils of Industry, and abused Charity: And therefore, without diminution to his own Glory, he could no longer bear with such mischievous and sawcy Raggamuffins, who were to be extirpated with as much diligence as our Ancestors used in the destruction of Wolves and Foxes."

Things being at this pass, you may easily imagine a Rupture must ensue. But because great Actions require considerable Allies, each Party in the first place entred into renewed Leagues of Confederacy with their respective Friends..

The Assistants of Poverty were,

1. Discontent, A person of a sullen Countenance and Melancholy Complexion, that always walks with his Hat over his Eys, and his Arms across, muttering like a Witch saying her Pater noster backwards. He complains so long of want, when he wants nothing but to know what he would have that at last (and deservedly) he comes to want indeed.

2. Despair, A near Kinsman of the former, and sworn Brother to Poverty. A meer Atheist as to Religion, and a Tyrant worse than Procrustes; hated by the common people for his Cruelty, because if he got any one into his clutches, he presently hanged him up.

3. Sloth, and Carelesness, Two Princes that are Cousen-Germans, but both so troubled with the Gout, That they concern themselves little with

[ 5 ]
---
State-masters : for they reckon the Summer too hot, and the Winter too

cold to make any Expedition in ; and loven othing so much as a good fire ,

and a Feather-bed : Their Arms are three Graboppers Cantant, and a Dor-

mousesomniant ; with this Motto ; Let the world flide. They are likewise

nearly related to Boverty, andvery rarely out of his Company.

4. Repining, The only person that whet.ed on the Duke and his Sub-

jects to these Wars; for he could by no means abide the Prince de l'Da's

people; anditfrettedhim more to see any of them thrive, than if him-

Telfhad fallen into the greatest calamiry.

5 Don Projectors, Duke of the Brain-pan Windwills; One that had

the sameMortalGrudge against Riches, as a cast-off Lover that rails at his

Mistress because he cannot catch her : He had Courted De l', with a

thousand Devifes, as Perpetual Motions, the Longitude, Philosophers whet-stone,

Art of makingGlass malleable, and Blanching of Blackanoors, &c. But not

being able to obtain so much as a place below stairs in his Court, after a

tedious attendance, was glad to lift himself under the Adversaries Standard,

and serve Poverty, as aVolunteer for term of life.

6.

Signior Gulletto Marquess of Bowzington; he had formerly been a 
Favorite of Prince de

l'Or

,

but

having swallowed

his

Patrimony

,

one day when he was drunk after too plentiful a Dinner, he happened to spew in his Soveraigns face; whereupon he was banisht for seven years into the Desarts of Lobspoundia, and then turned everlasting Renegado to the Duke of Ragland.

Lastly, Duke Humphrey, Earl of Hungary, an Excellent Souldier that had overthrown more Armies than Caesar, and never failed of speeding at a Siege; for he there behaves himself with such Resolution, that no stone-

wall (of what height or strength soever) is able to hold out against him.

As for de l'Di, you need not doubt but he was well Befreinded

his principal Allies were ,

1. Covetousnels, a wretched old meager chapp'd fellow, whose Eyes

were sunk (like a Candle in the socket) two inches into his Head, yet cont

tinually Rouling withan impiousLonging toget into his Clutches everys

thinghe looktupon, (exceptHeaven, and thathe never card for.) Hewas

properly asubject to poverty, being more indebted to hisBelly, than his

Head was worth, and lived altogether as wretchedly as the meanest of

Mendicofo's Vassals: Nor could he be much in favor with de l'Or, since he

had kept him close Prisoner, not permitting him to feethe Sun (though his

own Father that begot him) for many years together ; yet in this Exigency

against the common Enemy his Affiance was embraced.

C

2. Parcimony, Anafty Batchelor of Fourscore, that wears his Cleachs,

as long as the Israelites in their passage to Canaan, and will rather change his;

Religion twenty times, than his Doublet once; he seems to be Wespasians

Heir, for he makes his Pifs-potpay him Contribution ; keeps the parings

of his Nails to make Horn-sparrables, and fells the Clippings of his Beard

to stuff Tennis Balls with.

3. Violence, an Antient Courtier, and chief Minister to Abab, when he

seiz'd Naboths Vineyard : He knows no Law but his Will, nor Religion but

[6]

his Interest: Men worship him as Indians do the Divel, for fear rather than love; for his power can baffle Justice at pleasure, and was the first that made the Proverb Canonical, Might overcomes Right.

4. Deceit, one that looks a little a squint, but of so deep a reach, that he sometimes fetches over Covetuousness in spight of all his caution; he

is thought to be the By-blow of a Lawyer, beget on a Town-Jilt, and bred

up in the Kings-Bench-Rules; yet Tradesmen intirely love him, and he

has more followers than Nailor, Muggleton, or that Belweather of Faction

Smedtymnuus himself : you may know him bya perpetual fleer in his face ;

aFrenchHeart, and aDutchHead ; or a Quakers outside, and a Jesuitical

Lining. :

5. Usury, An old Hee-bawd, the first that taught Money to commit Incest, for the Letchery of Ten in the hundred. He seems a great House-keeper; for there are thousands in the City live upon him ; and yet there is no more

Conscience in him than in Tavern Fagets. He is a person of Quality and Of-

fice, being the Divels Tole-taker on Earth ; and when he dies, lies magni-

ficentlyEntombed with his Ancestors in the brightest Vault ofHell.

Cum multis aliis .
---
Affairs being thus far rippened for War, the Drums beat up for Volunteers on each side; and 'tis incredible to think what vast Numbers from all Quarters flockt in, to the Standard of Poverty.

The first that offered themselves were a Troop of Indigent Scholars in threadbare Black, that had just Learning enough to beg their Bread in several Languages; they made such hast to succour their old Acquaintance the Duke of Ragland, that many of them had scarce time to put on any shooes on their feet: Their Weapon was the fist of Logick with which, and the Two-edged Sword of Distinction, and some small-shot of Pedantry, they have done Christendome as much mischief, as ever it sustained from Goths and Vandals.
---
These were followed by a Regiment of Journeymen-Tailors each twenty thousand strong, Cleathed not, as Adam, in Fig Leaves, but more service- able Cabbadge : Their outside was very gay with Lace and Ribbons, though

both their Pockets and Bellies wanted Ammunition; and they would be sure to have Rufled-cuffs, though no Shirts. In a word, they were people

of an Invincible Stomack, and offered to serve Poverty, with their Lives

andFortunes, for an halfpenny brown George aday and Cucumbers.

Nota few, Itinerate Worthies of the Gentle Craft, having Mortgaged St.

HughsBones for Liquor to make them valiant, entered the service, swearing they would every Mothers Son outdo the Exploits of Hewson andSt.

Crispin. With them joined a multitude of Weavers, running as swift as

their Shuttle, and with as good will as if they had gone against the Common Enemy. aldar 2017 1941001

ATroop of younger Brothers, offered themselves to be of the Duke of De

nuria's Lifeguard : for though they had nothing to loose, yet they thought

they might gain a Knighthood, which wo shipfulBait might draw over some

rich Widdows of the Prince de l'Di's Party to nibble at it.

To attendthem, came in a Company ofold Serving-men ; which were made

[7]

made Canonneers, because they had such experience in Charging and Discharging the Great Leathern Bombard.

In the Rear, seaven thousand Bankrupts presented their service; but were entertain'd with some diffidence, because a number of Poverty's Army exclaimed against them, as the rankest Villains in a Common-wealth,

having undone them, their Wives and Children, and holding a secret Correspondence with the Enemy; however, at length they were received, and

hadtheordering of all Fire works, Mines, and Countermines, as being the

rarest Artists for damnable and speedy Blowing up in any Assault. {

But notwithstanding these and many other Volunteers, the Camp of Riches was much better furnisht and provided. And now Acts of Hostility began on either side.

First there issued out of the Army of the Prince del'Da, under the Com-

mand of Count Ignoramus Knaveskull, three Battalions of Petti-foggers ,

who falling amongst the Enemy, put the poor Bumkins into great confufi-

on, utterly ruining a considerable Party, and taking many Prison :

which they more easily effected, because they fought with white Powder, and

forced the filly Raskals always to pay them Contribution towards ther own

undoing.

Togive some diversion to these mischievous Assailants, Poverty fent

forth a Forlorn-Hope of Knights of the Post, Trepans, Forgers of Deeds, and

Suborners of Evidence ; together with an Ambuscade of Prior Mortgages, Antient Intails, Concealed Statutes, and Darmant Judgments, flankt with a reserve of vexatious Paupers ; who did notable service against the Enemy, and so much incommoded them, that they knew not which way to turn, and

were glad to quit several advantagious Posts they had formerly obtained.

Some few days after, happened a fierce Rencounter between a Legion of

Ale-drapers, Brokers, and Tally-men, on the one part ; and a Squadron of

Town- Bullies, whetstone-Park-Ladies, Oyster-women, Boxe-Lace-makers, Kitchin-

stuff- merchants, Broom-Jobbers, and other united Troops of Kent-street, Sharps-

Alley, Turmil-street, St. Gilfes, whitechappel, wapping, and Matton- Lane

whereinthe former being re-inforcedby a Detachment of Bum-Bailies, and

Marshals-men, after several br'sk Assaults, routed the latter : However, the

Bullies secured their Retreat into Alsatia. The whetstoneers came to an ho-

norable Composition : but the rest were so miserably pillaged, that they

had scarce a tatter left to cover them .

In the mean time Riches published an Ordinance, strialy Commanding

all Lords of Mannors, Landlordsieminent Merchants (especially Incorporated)

wealthy Farmers, Graziers, and Money-boarders, That they should immediately, and from time to time inhance the price of Corn and Provisions, en-

gross all gainful Commerce andCommodities, inclose all Commons, turn

outoldTenants, or renew their Leases not without excessive Fines ; break

upHouse-keeping, and retire in Hackney-Coaches to the City, whilst theis

Tenants and Dependants stary'd in the Countrey ; pull down allAlms-

houses and Hospitals, or (which is as bad)divert their Revenues quite con

trary to the Founders Intent ; and in general, not to hold the least Corref-

pondence with the subjects of poverty, but force them, out of pure wantand

and necessity to return to their obedience; or rather, utterly rout them out from off the face of the earth. To countermine these Stratagems, Poverty dispatches a Company of needy Gallants into the Enemies Territories, who did wonderful execution: For in less than one Months time, by the help of false Dice and falser Mistresses, Horse-racings, Cock-fightings,

Sure-

tiships,

and continual Debauches, two Thousand Country-Squires, Aldermens Sons, and other Cullies of eminent note, heretofore in the Prince de L'or's Court, were brought in Prisoners to their Garrison of Beggars-bush. Besides, he hired a parcel of Hackney-Clerks, and Small Conveyancers, who getting secretly into the Enemies Magazine, by leaving out, or

rendered their Ammunition unserviceable . Thereby betraying

,

as fast as heretofore Towns surrendred to French Pistols

.

The War being maintained thus obstinately, a sad Accident hapned in the Camp of Riches: For a terrible new Disease, worse than the Griping of the Guts, called The gnawing of the Conscience, got amongst them, which seized them with violent Vomitings to cast up their ill gotten Wealth .

The

Usurers

,

as

they

were one Night keeping Guard over their beloved Bags, were frighted out of their senses by the Ghosts of certain Widows and Orphans; and the Brokers ran up and down raving-mad

, crying,

The Devil! The Devil!

On the other side the Troops of Poverty were reduced to extraordinary hardships. Their Souls were desperate, and their Bodies confirmed; weary of their Lives, and yet compelled to live for further Miseries : So that both States being almost ruined by these Contentions ,

began now to wish for Peace . Whereupon Chanity and Industry ( the first revived by the help of an unknown Rosie - crucian Doctor, and the latter recall'd from Banishment) undertook to be Mediators between them , by whose good offices, in short time, a firm League was concluded on these Articles;

1. That from and after the One and thirtieth day of September next happening, all Hostilities shall cease; and thence forward the Rich shall not in any place or kinde insult over nor oppress the Poor; but employ, cherish, and relieve them, to the best of their Power.

2. That the Poor shall abandon their old League with Pride and Laziness, and joyning in with Content and Diligence, shall no longer envy, nor repine at the Rich.

a new

and

firm

Alliance

3. That Poverty's Subjects should be ever in a readiness ( as the Switzers are for pay ) to fight for Money, if she craved their aid; and that that Money in requital, should help them, whensoever theystoodin need.

4. And lastly, For a firm Foundation of future Amity, since they were two Nations so mighty, so nearly allied by Blood, so dispersed into all the parts of the world, and yet so mingled together, that it was impossible to sever them:

By mutual Consent a Laro was madez That Fortune should uld be longer Blinde ; but that all the Doctors and Surgeans should by their Elixars

help her

to

her

Eyes, that she may hence forwards see those, upon whom she bestowes her Blessings. Because hitherto Fools

have been by her served with Wealth, which they knew not how to use; and Wife-men sent away ( like Beggars from a Misersgate )

with empty Wallets.

These Articles being mutually Signed and Ratified, the Armies broke up, Trade was set at Liberty; the Rich men began to Feast one another, ( as they were wont to do ) and the Poor were kept poor still : Some had too much, some too little, and none enough: and so it will be to the End of the Chapter.
