OF THE

SIR,

I TAKE not the Freedom of affixing your Name to these Trifles, from an Imagination that they are worthy the Perusal of a Person of your sound Sense, and solid Judgment, but as an Instance, to convince those who are generaly prejudic'd against all Persons who have the Command of Prisoners, that your mild Government, and engaging Conversation have such Charms, as may exert a Ludicrous Fancy, even under the Misfortune of Confinement. I need not inform the World how well you are Descended, what an Eminent Merchant you have been, how many Thousands Master of, 'till by Storms, Tempests, and other unavoidable Accidents, you lost immense Sums in a short Time; nor with what Rays

The Dedication.

of Honour and Probity your Character always Shin'd: To these, none who knew you formerly are Strangers: What I shall briefly insist upon, is your most excellent Management of that Port you have so long Possest. Nor is it a little Satisfaction to me, that your Merits transcend the reach of Flattery, and by Consequence vindicate me from all suspition of that Crime, since it is universally acknowledged, that your Conduct in Point of Prudence, Generosity, Compassion, &c. not only much surpasses all that ever was discover'd in your Predecessors. but 'tis also to be fear'd, will never be Imitated by those who shall succeed you, by Reason few who are truly Ingenuous, will risk the Blemish of coming short of so Bright a Pattern of Wisdom and Goodness. Tho' your Power is very extensive in its own Nature, yet you render it Otherwise to your self, in strictly Limiting it by the Rules of Honour and Equity. Your Demands for the Liberty of the Rules are very Easie, if we consider the great Value of it; and ‘tis but Reason you shou'd have Something for so great a Benefit, on account of the Hazard you run of Troubles and Expences in Law-Suits, notwithstanding the Securities given you. So far are you from Insulting any under your Power, that you treat all Gentlemen, with the same Civility and Respect, as cou'd be shewn 'em in their most Flourishing Circumstances; and so wide from Conversing with any to their Expence, that you are continually Entertaining several at your own Table; Nay, often have advanc'd Money to your own Prisoners, under pressing Exigencies, and even after you have been Abus'd by others for the same Generosity. You have forgiven your own Fees and Chamber-Rent to many, to make their Discharge more easie; and are always ready to assist such as apply themselves to you, to bring their Affairs to an happy Conclusion; seeming more pleas'd to loose Customers for Chamber-Rent, &c. when to their Ease and Comfort, than Others are of Gaining 'em; Nay, so extreme Compassonate are you to the Unfortunate, that you have frequently advis'd 'em, when they have proffer'd Gold for the Liberty of the Rules, first to offer it to their Creditors, to try if it might not Compound for their Discharge: Hence it is, that whereas former Marshalls, (from a Consciousness of their Barbarous Usuage) have not dar'd to come Home without a Guard, all the Gentlemen now are ready to venture their Lives in your Defence. Shou'd any Reflect that this Lenity towards the Debtor, proceeds from a meer Easiness of Nature, and at the same time void of Equity to the Creditor; Tis Answer'd, that

The Dedication.

your wise Management has tended more to the Benefit of the Creditor by far, than that of any of your Predecessors; except the Rifling a Debtor to his very Skin, can be thought a proper Method to Inable and Encourage him to become Solvent; and whereas former Marshalls readily quitted Securities for Greater Sums, not regarding whether the Debtor run away next Day, you take care, (where you cannot depend on their Principles) of ether Substantial Security; and certainly while you prevent Knaves, none but those of a Barbarous Nature, will condemn your Indulgence to Honest Gentlemen. But as the Brightest Virtues are oftnest oppos'd by Calumny, so your Merit must have been less to be absolutely free from it. Yet upon examining into all Reflections, which appear to have any shadow of Ground for 'em, I find 'em wholly to arise, either from such who have abus'd their Liberty, and thereby have exacted the more Severity from you, in your own Defence; or from Prevarications of your Under Officers, which (on notice given) you immediately Rectify, or else from Party-Misrepresentations: An Instance of the first happen'd some time since, in a Person who attempted to break out of the Bench, yet even to Him, you remitted great part of the Rigour in your Power to impose, and after the most Ingrateful Returns for your Generosity towards him; And I cannot in Honour decline the detecting an Aspersion cast on you in Relation to the last: Which was, that upon Choice for Parliament Men, you shou'd threaten those under your Power with close Confinement, if they Voted not for Mr. Halsey, which not only to my Knowledge was false in every particular, but I also heard you mention Sir George Matthews with much Respect, with which (in Justice to your fair Management) I acquainted him. To conclude, Sir, a Character might be much inlarg'd upon; When you found the Severity of the Times, begun to reduce Unfortunate Gentlemen so far, that without much Jstrait'ning 'em, you cou'd not exact so much from 'em, as the support of your Post requir'd; rather than offer at a Thing (tho' in Justice you might have done it) so repugnant to your Sweet and Compassionate Temper, you fought to Resign it; yet like a tender Father, who provides for his Children after his Decease, you propos'd another Gentleman to supply your Room, whom first you oblig'd to follow exactly those Measures your self had taken, with all those at present in the Place. As an Irrefragable Argument, that all the Above carries an Air with it of the (strictest Truth, (and of which no Age affords a Precedent) on

The Dedication.

first Notice that you intended to Resign, a General Petition from the Gentlemen of the Place, was deliver'd to my Lord Chief Justice Parker, Intimating the high Satisfaction they have enjoy'd from the Favourable Management of your Station, and Hopes of your Continuation; frequent Complaints have been made by Gentlemen here against your Predecessors, but never 'till now has been offer'd such Demonstration of their Respect and Esteem. Thus Sir, in all your Transactions you have approv'd your Self, so Just, Generous, Curteous, Kind and Charitable, that you have appear'd in a special manner to be appointed by Providence for this Post, in Compassion to the Sufferings of the Unfortunate. As (amongst many others) has been Experienc'd by,

Sir,

Humble Servant,

OF THE

Queen's-Bench.

Occasion'd by a PETITION of the Gentlemen of the Place, to the Right Honble the Lord Chief Justice.

WHEN Ovid was to Cruel Exile sent;

With Him the Roman Muse to Pontus went;

But much furpriz'd to find ( when thither come )

Scythia less Savage than her Native Rome,

So Mine, allarm'd with dreadful Fears before)

Imagin'd Southwark was a Scythian Shore.

But to the Gen'rous MARSHALS's Presence brought,

We soon recanted that mistaken Thought;

The Muse with his obliging Looks was pleas'd,

But when she heard him speak ( with Rapture seiz'd)

She bless'd the Charming Tongue that cou'd dispense,

In Courtly Language, Oracles of sense;

Then whisper'd in mine Ear --

[ To William Broughton, Esq; ]

Take Courage Bard, once more our Joys are crown'd,

We have a second Patron here, a second Dorset found.

The First to Thee, Great Britain's Lawrel gave,

But THIS Releasment from a Living Grave,

When for Church-Service to Confinement run,

And Wretchedly, yet Gloriously undone.

O therefore to your silent Cell retire.

To sing him thanks, then break your Luckless Lyre.

No Forcd Excuse, for this Address we plead,

No Pow'rful Friend engage to Intercede;

This Priv'ledge does of Right to Us belong,

when, Signal Merit mounts above the Throng,

Poets must pay the Tribute of their Song.

When Duty Challenges this Just Respect,

Tis Forfeit of our Charter to neglect.

---

On such Endowments how coud She enlarge,

Endon>?nents worth}' of a Nobler Charge;

A Genius for sublimer Station born,

Desert that might Great Britain's State adorn.

But such is Angel's condescending Love,

For Mortal's Aid, they quit the Bow rs Above,

[ To William Broughton, Esq; ]

r ? Then shun the wealthy Seats, where Grandeur dwells. For the poor Guardianship of Cottages and Cells.

Your Candour, Sir, this Sally must excuse,

Of an Oblig'd and much Inamour'd Muse,

Who now (transported,) fees above Her Banks Your Southwark swell, and thus resounds her Thanks.

All who before my Rustic Seat defpis'd,

The Nat'ral Product of our Southern Shore,

But now Improv'd to Sense and Manners too.

Resin'd as e'er in Covent-Garden grew;

Our Thames can now what Tyber ne'er cou'd boast Polite Inhabitants on either Coast.

As in a Province by a Vice-Roy Sway'd,

A Gentle Ruler is by all Obey'd,

Oppress'd by former Tyrants 'tis with Fear, ,

Those Subjects must of a Successor hear .

[ To William Broughton, Esq; ]

To the chief Guardian of Great Britains Laws;

To Mr. SMITH.

Luxuriant Fancy! Nothing can Controul,

Or Daunt the Vig'rous Sallies of your Soul;

In vain your Body was a while Confin'd,

The Globe can set no Limits to your Mind:

Few have such stanch Philosophy Confest,

To Laugh at Injuries, and make Restraint a Jest.

Such Bright Cmvirje as yours may change our Laws,

Or Cruel Creditors, will drop their Cause *,

Nay, some for That, Jnfoiver.cy may Feign,

And count their Lass of Liberty, their Gain.

The Mint (as is in Ancient-Records told)

Was once the Office, for Impressing Gold,

But now the Torrer must to that submit,

For Coining a much Nobler Metal, Wit.

Since you're with Honour now discharg'd, haft o'er.

And Sprightly Wit to'ts Native Clime restore;

OF THE

Mint and Queen's-Bench, &c.

LETTER I.

SIR,

Nothing can be a more agreeable Task, than what you have engag'd me in, viz. to give you an Account of the Affairs of this World, (known to that part of Europe you dwell in, by the Name of the Queen's-Bench) and which I shall prove in a following Letter, to be a distinct World from yours. But least you shou'd think my Arrival hither, as Romantic as his was, who invented a Machine to mount him into the World in the Moon, I'll give you as rational an Account of my Proceeding, as the Nature of the thing will bear. It was not from any Report I had receiv'd of the Beauty, Magnificence, or Wealth of the Place, or of the Learning or Politeness of the Inhabitants; that I was tempted to this Viage, nor really so much as a fixt Intention, I had at that instant for Travelling; but at the Instigation of some Friends, who were (it seems) more sollicitous for the Enlargement of my Understanding, than they found me inclin'd to, I was (in a manner) Spirited hither; for a Commissioner for the Peopling these Territories, putting on Humane Shape, whisper'd a few hard Words in mine Ear, in a surprizing Dialect, and at the same time produc'd a Parchment Scrol, which in Magical Notes contain'd a Charm too strong, for all my Vertue to oppose; the Force whereof immediately put my reluctant Vehicle into a progressive Motion. Our first Stage was to his own Seat, where, besides all other Civilities, He

[ 10 ]

did me the Honour of placing his own Guards upon me, a Favour I cou'd willingly have excus'd, but that his Curtesy press'd it upon me. Liquor flow'd in abundance, not only to me, but amongst all his Attendance also, and (indeed) he conferr'd the Honour upon me of Treating them all; but I found his principal Kindness consisted, in endeavouring to Lighten me all he cou'd, for the greater ease in my Passage; the End of Which was (after I had discharg'd his House, and my self of all I had about me) to bring me to an lnchanted Cattle, call'd ( as I have since learn'd,) the Marshalsea; and there, He gave me ta underfiand, his Commission ended. The various Spettades in this Place ;were amazing, in one Place you hear a Fiddle, in another a Groan; here a Piper, there a Penitent; in another place a f at Band, and after her a Skelleton, at the Head of fifty walking Diseases, tho I rarely met a fighting Face, yet there's lcarce a Man, that is notathou-sand strong, and what is strange, he feeds all these, while he flatveshimself. Within you hear the Chicking of Irons, anid Volliesof Oaths, while they are. fetter'd from throwing ought else, at one another's Heads. The most wretched here, Fare the best, and eat out of the Basket, while those on the other side, are ready to eat them up. After a while I had made Remarks oa the great Variety this Scene contains. Attendants were order'd to wait upon me to a Judge, to Sign my Pass-port to these Realms, of which I after became an Inhabitant. I was first convey'd to a Strufiure in one of the Avenues, belonging io 'em, call'd. (in the vulgar Term) Bird-Cqge-jiHey, and was not a little fur priz'd at the wonderful Transformations all fnffer there; for they enter Woodcocks, continue Owls, and go out Canary- Birdsy but (contrary to the manner in your World) the longer they're Copp'd, the Leaner they grow. But 'twere Ingrateful to pal's over the Gare rook of us there; for least wefhou'd run into Dangers, by rambling-abroad in the Night-time, in a strange Country, our Doors are salt Lock'd and Bolted upon us'; and Snce many, when their Heads are di-fttjrb'd with new Adventures, are apt to walk in their Sleep, and mistaking the Doors, to go out at the Windows, those there, are set thick, with Iron to: prevent ,such Mischiefs. None but Persons of Condition,

have.the Privilege of this Palace, who come with Letters of Recommendation to jthe Prince, and the Price of their Liberty, which when pur. chas'd, tjhey.have the freedom of ranging throughout the Empire; but if they presume beyond its Limits, a pit cel of Furies, in the Shape of Escape-"Warrants, lie in wait, to hurry them to next Goal, from whence there is bo-Redemption, 'tillclear'd of all theyVe charg'd with; which Trespass was carefully avoided by. Sir,

tms, See.

LETTER II.

LETTER II.

SIR,

I Undertook in my last to prove this to be another World, distinct from yours, which I. doubt not easily to deinonstrate, since out Poll* tics, Morals, Conversation, Dress, and every thing differs from yours. Liberty and Property, so valu'd by you, we look upon as Obftades to true Happiness, for we think no Man ought to be trusted with the first, by reason it proves oftner, Instrumental to his Distrudtlon, than to his Edifi-caypn; and the last, being but Burthen some, every one quits it, before he approaches ode Shoars. To do as ire woud be done by, we have found by dear Experience, when among you, to be a meer Chymcrical, Impradlicable Notion, therefore loose no time, by inculcating it here. Conversation is esteem'dUby you, in Proportion to the many Thousands Men Possess, but by ifs, by the Thousands they're less than nothing '> therefore a Man that breaks for an Hundred Thotjfand Pounds, scorns to keep Company with one, jwho breaks for an Hundred. A Demand of Debt, which fowrs People of your World, fees 'em all a Laughing here, for they look on the Demandant as a Merry Andrew come to divert 'em , but if a Debtor Proraifes, he is suspected of Treason to the Conllitucion, ,9.r sent to a Mad-House: Yet these Things happen not, but when a Dun arrives,-unacquainted with our Rules of Arithmetic; for moll here are wilhngto Pay, even to the last Numerical Pound, all We differ in is, you reckon Twenty Shillings to the Pound, and we but Two and Six-pence, and the Proverb you allow of, justifEs us herein, That dl who go to Rorne,.;w«/2 do as Rome dots, with you the Creditor is Caress'd, with us the Debtor, and the ,£rft only liable to Punishment, if he transgresses the Decorum of the Place» which is, to be thrown into the black River Lethe, on our Western Borders, 'till he forgets all former Passages of his Lift, and is thence render'd more receptive of our Mode of Speech, Good Cloaths so much efteemd there, are faandalous here, by giving a Jealousie of conveying away -the Wealth of the Nation. To pull ouc a Watch is taken for an Affront to the Company, asdefign'd to set Limits to good Conversation; and are so rarely seen, that upon producing one lately, fevet al were ready to give upon Oath, that it was a Living Creature: But one after arriving with a Silver Hiked Sword, all concluded it to be a flaming Meteor, whose appearance mull: needs be on some Portentuous Account; this made many endeavour to recoiled! their Prayers, which they had forgotten these twenty Years. Some here will talk of Golden Snuff-Boxes, Diamond Rings, ire. they were formerly Mailers of, but foobfcurely, that their Images appear altnoft worn out of their Memories. With you the Father keeps Possession, and Maintains, the Son, with.us the Son is often put into Possession

[ *2 ]

and Maintains the Father. There the Husband Travels, and the Wife keeps at Home, Here the Husband keeps at Home, and the Wife goes Abroad. We have a Mint^ as'Well as You,'but Yours Cains Money* Ours only Melts it down. You walk about to get a Stomach to your Dinner, we do the fame, to get a Dinner to our Stomachs. An Execution is Hanging with You, but here it fayes a Man,' so that many an one hath liv'd aftet ir, to fee all his Sons Hang'd before Him, thus every Thing Is tranCu&ed in direct reverse to what it isTn your World. I am,

Sir, 8CC.

LETTER 1

SIR,

IN your Answer to my last, you appear a little impatient to be inform'd under what Denomination, this World may pafsy I had satisfy'd your Curiosity herein before, had not my Ignorance thereof till now prevented me. The Truth is. no People under the Species of Humankind. are so little anxious for improving -their Knowledge, as those of this Country , their enquiry rarely reaching further, than to satisfy themselves, how to Dine, and how tu spend the Day' after: And there is certainly a kind of Felicity in this Temper, Gnre discovery more increasesa Thirst after Knowledge, than gives, Satisfaction to it: However a Dispute oc.that very Sabjeft, happening two Days since, very luckily for your Information, f firall give you the Particulars of it. Several of the Learned meeting together, a few uncommon Cups, fir'd their Ambition for making fotne Discoveries, beyond what they are usually inclin'd to, when perticularly, the Que(lion you are fullicitous about was started , but such Debates not being very frequent, they were manoag'd with a little Confusion at first, 'tili at length-they agreed to choose a Committee anddhatt-man'by Balloting, which being done, a young Pedant (font hither by an Infidel rtf an Hostess) addrefung bimfclf to a Chi'u-man, Ciid: In my Opinion this nr'ft be that Infernal Region, under the absolute Jurisdiction of Pluto, of which the Poets have given so Urge an A'count, from the Analogy it bears, to the Relation they have-giv^n of that Place, and of the Sufferings of the Persons Confin'd in it. fVr/?, Because-all' pass to it over the Fatal River Stjx (by you call'd the Tbamti) and so very few of them return again to the World from whence they came. Then on the Western side rouls.the black River Lctkt,' whose Stench and 'Stagnatim are of so expunging a duality, that when any Bailiffs, or ill-m&ftner'd Creditors, are thrown, into it, all former Images of Barbarity, presently vanifefrom their Memo-

ries, and they rife up again as tame Monsters, as Heart can wilh, All are also hurry'd hither by Furies, in the Shapes of Serjeants, Bailiffs, Tip-staves, be. There's Cerberus also (under the Name of Turn-Key) who must be Brib'd with a Silver Sop, or no Mercy is to be expected; and tho' he has not three Heads, he may have as much Milchief in one, as the other in all three. Those on the Gentlemen's side, endure the Torment of Tantalus, by seeing the common side, Chop up all the Victuals in the Basket, which they in vain Gape for. The Punishment of the Btllides, is here to be met with in every Corner, inflicted on those, who let all their Friends bellow on them* pass thro”em, as thro'a Sieve, stil] leaving'em in fiatu quo. Great Numbers suffer the Plague of Siftphtts, who are daily coming to a Conclusion with their Creditors, but still the Stone rouls back with additional. Force, against their declining strength to raise it. Many Languish also under the Misery of Prometheus, while Famine (that Voracious Culture') not.only.Gorges it self on their Livers, but also on their Lights, Lungs, and other Vital Parts With all other Tortures which the Fitttds their Cre. ditors, can impose upon 'em. The Power af the Monarch likewise over the Liberty of his Suhjcfts, is abfokite beyoad any President in your World, and Pluto's extends not to Life ir self.' To this a Poet reply'd, I can by no means accord with that Gentleman in his Opinion of this World j it appears very abfur'd to fancy it Hell, when we meet not one Vfurer in it, a 'd so very few Lawyers % Nay the mod: Villainous of Mankind, Bailiff's, very rarely touch on our Shoar. .1 rather take it to be Ely-fium; since it feetns a soft Retirement from the Fatigues, of Life. No Noises of Ravage, Plunder, Sacrilidge,- nor so much as the Rumour of W'rs reach our Ears. No Extortioner (hews his Teeth her', to grind the Face of the Poor. No harsh Dictates of the Law affect usBut each witti a Tranquil and Serene Breast, leads his Beauteous, and Seraphic Niroph,

to shady Groves, and Purling Streams. ----- At this a Sow'r Gentleman

started up, and Cry'd, Ho'd, hold, Mr. Poet, thus :iis always with you, when ' you have got into your Flights, and your Fiddle Faddles; to mistake, Nasty Drabs in St. George's Fields, for Seraphic Nimphs, and the (linking Ditch by the Bowling Green, for Purling Streams; i tell you flatly, and amPofi- , tive in't,'tis neither Heavn nor Hell; not the»first, because Mint.Rags, will hardly pass for Robes or Glory; nor the la ft, by reason the DiWil can'tendure a Poet, he so out-does him at hisownTrade of Lyings.therefore it can be nothing else but directly Purgatory, and I'll dye in the Faith of it; for it not only Purges a Man's Purse. but also his Heart, Blood and Guts, e'er he has been here a Twelve Month. There is Pyer Paunch, he brought with him last Year, four- hundred Pounds of Flesh, Avtrdupoife Weight, and now yon may draw him thro'a Gold Ring} Nay,'l am told, when we have been here Sev'n Years', they make Skittle Pins of our Bones A grave Philofophic Gentleman oppos'd to this; Your Arguments will noc hold, ro prove it Purgatory, for dUr Purses are well Purg'd before we come hither, and generally Have cast their last Calves, and as for an Abfte-

nii >ua

tmons Diet, I think it so far from being ah(5bftacle to true* Happlndls, that 'tis often a Promoter of it, since Health both of Body and Mind ate prelerv'd thereby; and by what has been alternately Discuss'd before,- it can neither be Htavn nor Hell, therefore in my poor Judgment, it may not be improper to Style it by some new Name , what if we call it the Thant ajlic WerU, iincefo full of whimtical Circumstances, running Counter in all the Transitions in it, to what we formerly receiv'd for the Dilates of Reason: After all had a while revolv'd on the Notion, and Retir'd witbia themselves, for the Opinion of their Informing Faculties, they unanimously agreed, that this Epithet was most Significant and Com-prehenfive. This is all the present account cante given by, Sir,

Toort, &c.

LETTER IV.

SIR,

SINCE yon have so kindly receiv'd, what my Inclination prepat'd for your Entertainment, I shall with the more alacrity proceed in the Task I have undertaken. 'Tis held for a general Maxim, That all ought to defind the Reputation of the Government tohich ProteSls 'em, and the Character of thfirFefov) Subject, attending to promote their emn- I being not only Naturaliz'd here, butt also preferr'd to the Dignity of a Bencher, fhou'd be wanting in my Duty, did I natdischargeivperticularly inthisPoint. Our Government is Absolute and Dispotic, beyond that of France, or the Grand Signiort, for oar Monarch-can redrain the Liberty of his Subjects at Plea-lure j without giving other Reason for. it, than that it is his Pleasure so to do: a Power frequently exerted by his Predecessors, when ever a Fit of the Spleen came over them, or a Difficiency in their Exchequer provok'd 'em to it- As such Government is the word' in the World, when a Tyrant fits at the Helm, so it is the best, when a Wife and mild Prince fills thcThrone, -asatpresent happensrfor He isfo far from insulting the Liberty of his Sobiefis, thas ( his just Tribute paid, a Trifle comparative to tile immunities obrain'd for it) He often generously entertains 'em, and in such a enrteous manner, that it softens all their -Sufferings. We are under no perticniar Laws, which shew we come nearer to the State of Innocence: and I confess I was never so much mistaken in any thing as in the Opinion I conceiv'd of the People here, before i liv'd among 'em*, I imagin'd them to be a parcel of Profligare, Lewd Rakes, who by Riotous Living, became Insolvent, and so came hither to defraud their Creditors: whereas I find now, 'tis Malice, Revenge, Impatience, or Circumvention,

brought

brought 'em all hither, and not a Man of 'em but cou'd have paid Foity or Fifty Shillings per Pound, had they fair Sealing, or a little time allow'd 'em: This is the Voice of all when they arrive; Tis true, tiiey generally speak it to an unbelieving Audience, but wane of Faith in the Hcartr, ought not to reflect on the Character of the Relater. Vice Reigns nor here Comparatively to what it does in your World; if a Man, gets Drunk one Day, he usually dees Pcnnance ior ir, by faffing three Days after; If one finds an Appetite to a Wench, too strong for his Reason to controal, he however endeavours to Mortily it, by taking up with such a dirt', ill-favour'd Drab, a? may give him a L aching to the fame Sport, a long time after. Nor need \ve a Statute to limit Gaming to Ten Pounds, for our Bowling seldom exceeds a Sice, our Back Gammon, a Mug of Ale, and our Ctrds, a Pipe of Tobacco. Perhaps you'll put on a farculucal Fleer, and lay all tltefe Negative Virtues atile from want of Money, and not of Inclination; bur unce every thing has two Handles, Wisnonews that People (thro' the depravety of Humane Nature,) fhou'd take all by the worst. Pimps, Bullies, Bauds, Punk.', &c. are never Naturaliz'd here, but halt at the Marshalsea, and other Receptacles for such Vermine on your iide; not being able to defray the Charge of their Pass-port hither: Perhaps some may Ihchcr in the Mint, but chat (tho* on our Borders) is a separate Common wealth (of which I may give some further account in a following Letter) and as we own no Alliance to it, so we are not accountable for their Crimes. Misers, Dfitrers, and Extortioners, those barbarous Villains, who are Nourish'd by the Tears of-Widows, and Orphans, and Swarm so among you, are perfect Strangers here: Nor do this Ancient Records of our Kingdom, take notice of above one of those Infamous Wretches, that ever was brought hither j and that was by Mistake, it a Miser's Ft aft; where he was taken for his Twin-Brother, of an Op-police Inclination , but after he had been Ihewn about, some time for a Monster, our Land Spew'd him up, lead he fhou'd Debauch the Inhabitants thereof. On the Contrary, it is well known, that this World is Peopled, with the most Noble, Bountiful, and Generous Spirits of yours; who having arriv'd to that Celebrated Pitcbjof Philosophy, The Contempt of Money, difpers'd it frankly Abroad: And that 'tis oh their Munificence, those remaining with You, have built their Fortunes: Nay of so Excellent a Quality is onr Climate, that they who bring over with 'em, any Remains of Pride and Ambition, have 'em soon purg'd away by it. As for Religion, there is little Noise of it here, and 'tis generally observ'd, there is tnoftof it, where there is the leaf! Noise of it; however Gold is wotship'd here, as well as by you, but with a sublimer Notion of that Deity, for we believe it Invisible, and by Conference, Spiritual, while you adore it under a gross Corporeal Form; but in other Articles we agree with you, except in your Creed, for our People have been To often deceiv'd in your World, that they bring very little Faith over with 'em: Tho' I my self have retain'd so much, as to believe your Friendship will be perpetual towards, Sir,

C Yours, &c.

We have a; incredbk Number of Captains her'-, perhaps enough to Head nil the A:v. its in En-nfty for if any Man can produce v'rnefs, tiut he has ftcdf.ftiy for ball an hour look'd on a brown Market, without ill-king , cr wrapt ip in Lair has made a Figure in tie T raia-bar.ds, it Hives him his Choice of a Tro<-y of Horse, or Company of Fcor: Alio if cr.e can give Evidence, that I, has cross'd the H-.nir.g Pond, and fmelc to a Bowl oi Porch, he next wa;. is cub'd Captain of a Man of War y These HerYs arefo jealous for main, laining' their Honour, that they'll rather tuft nine Day?, than Mortgag. the cold Iren by their hides for a Dinner: Fhey talk freq icutjy of fendin' Pieces cf Psfcr, but their Loyalty to their Prince so v\ ifdy Cuibs their Fury that their Charges seldom proceed to Thrups, bccaulc they have a No tion that if a Man is kill'd under Ex. embn, it may prove D; ti imentai t. his Government: Certainly such Cor.dust, Joyn'J with so much Courage wou'd render'em Invincible on a Julb Occahon. However they Ihinc clearly oat in other QualiScatiocs of a Soldier, tiz. Brandy, Tobacco, and; Drab in St. George's Fields. Another great pait of the Inhabitants an rack'd in the CLffis of Gentlemen -, what t'c.Y a Man was got on a Bulk tcok in by the Parish, and after put out by 'em to a Thimble-maker; th: very Track of such Mechanical Operations is raz'd 04c 01 their Memories They walk about at their ease, put on wife Locks to talk cn State Affairs extreamly satisfy'd, when they hear Tides ar.d Garters are difpes'd of ti their Likings wonderful sollicitous feran Honourable Peace , anxious un der Apprehenficns of an Inglorious one; and when they can Muller up; Sice, luofe it with an Act at the Bowling Green, and next Day Diueo; three half-penny worth af Beef, and Porrage into the Bargain. We hav also abundance of Merchants, for if a Man has- adventur'd a pair c Silk-Stockings to S-swy and bad in P,etmn a Pound of Snuff, I sufficiently lhtitks. him to that Der.omir alien, and to the cnlarginj upon the Subject, with how many Thoufunos he has loft by Stcrrm Wrecks, &c. and twice as much r n by the F> e>.ih. You shall oi ten hca of Lcffts fuftairfd by forne in one Y-.r, which amount to.tifty times mcrc than they and all their Ancestors wcic worth, ever since their Names firl came in with the Sixor.s. But what is unac.otmtabl'e, most of 'em hav loft more since they came in, than in all their Lives before , for it has bcc observ'd, that a Pafon, who at his entrance, has given a Mud eft accotin of Five ThoufandPoucds, in a few Years, has rais'd it to Fifty ', not tha these are very pernicious Lie-, btcrufe no Body is deceiv'd by 'em.

Prognofticnirg the Effc&s of the Souch^ea Trade, Temperature of Climates, mcafnin-i Distances, &c. which they do for rchelhing their Memories, other wise some have been here To long, they wou'd forget what Occupation they fallow'd, Shop-leipsrs come over in Flights, like Wood 'Cocks in Winter, the wil'cv fort (like broken Bones well Set) Compound with their Creditors, and go out Richer than they came in: The rest-consume the little Substance they have left, at Skittles, after adjourn to the Bench, and at lad ileep with their Fore-fathers. A-, for Lamy:rs, they have generally Knavery enough, to keep 'em on your side the Water, if a Qualm happens.to come over 'em, and they b(cgin to prow Honcfl, wc have 'em presently, but so very poor, char their first Hep is to the Bench and Basket. Pons we have here also, but they drink lb little Wine, and arc so tardy seen to Ear, that 'ris Imagin'd, they have found out means for obtaining Nr Bar and Amirofi.t^ the Repast of the Gods, and chiefly subsist thereon: By declining such gross Nourj/hnaents they were formerly familiar with, their Bodies are become meer Airy Vehicles, more favouring the reby the strong Energy of their Soiiis j. on which account we are in Expectation of abundance of Sublime; when I am made happy by some Specimens of it, they shall be faithfully communicated to jOti by, Sir, V;

E you arc pleas'd to define some account of the fi-hier^znA'Airs^ h the Pimple of this Cmld discover in their CouvcrLation, I uvour to answer your Expectation herein. They are really much as in i he Courts of your Emxpcaw Princes, and in some Cafes the feints of Civility arc carry'd a little beyond what is to be met with there y Piich in time may render 'em Piefidents, worthy lmnilration'; for they tc a very' Promising People, as even the severest of their tfedi-nrs will acknowEdge. Here arc feme who have the Prince's Ear, who are Xtrcrm Ci.urtcous and Obliging; ready toimbraceall Opportunities to live you, and will piocerd (Just as at your C->nrts) in Proportion to |py; if you forget that, they fluent you, r.s thinking ir not good Manners, i :ft Counter to yours; but Duns (Lew a thousand times more good fCv.nng thm with you, there tiiey arc furlv, kr.it their Brows and Thrca-K here tJwy mildly In treat, and not beyond what may confiftwith your onvcniei.cy.

dir. ft'on to their Advantage, these walk strictly by Rule, even when they ate ir.dolg'd with the greatest Liberty, while those aft so exorbitantly then, that they are often brought hither after, to learn a better Decorum. Entertainments on Vifitsalfo are extream Courtly, a Tale of anew Adven-tnre'fapplies the Room of a Bottle of Wine, and so your humble Servant. They have such an Aversion to a Foppish Air in Dress, that they feidom Disguise their Wigs with Powder, nor are extream folficitous for the Prc-servation of their Teeth, having not much occasion for them; however rh;y who have clean Linnen, wear it, and they who have nor, with a . eat deal of Philosophy despise it. We are frequently invited to Din-,cr at good Tables, but they are better Bred, than to offer it Gratis, Icaft it (hon'd be taken as an Affront to our Misfortunes. The better fort of Marry'd People, lead their Lives much like your Quality, speak to one another Civilly, Love one another indifferently, and for avoiding Curtain-Lectures, the Thames often parts their Beds. The llnmarry'd keep as they are, from an Observation, that many are brought hither by their Wives, but few ate carry'd back by 'em. The Children are very happy, for owing nothing to their Parents, but their Being, they are very rarely ruin'd by Indulgence, and as feidom tempted at one and twenty to that wicked Option, Pray Father pleaftto dye. Piide, State, and Ambition, are perfect Strangers here, and to continue them so, our Inhabitants before their Arrival, wifely rid themselves of all Fuel may feed those noxious Flames. Flattery never disguises our Conversation, because never Rewarded, nor is Friendship commenc'd on Mercenary Ends, fmee all depended on it, is a Good Morrow, for which Rcafans, Obligations never grow a Burden , as yours mull of necessity become to roe, except I can find an opportunity, by some piece of Service to evince how much I am, Sir,

LETTER VII.

SIR,

I Shou'd give you a very imperfect account of these Territories, did I «ot acquaint you*that they contain two Species of Government, one is lute Monarchy, and of which I have been a Subj'ft; the other Democracy, and extends its Jarifdiction throughout that part of the Country known by the Name of the Mint, which Government is exercis'd by a Triun.vi, rate, call'd Stewards; who fit to dilpiteh Affairs of State, at three Principal OE:e$, which are at so many Entrances into their Dominions. Each of these is attended by fix Representatives of the People, who bear the Character of ?eadits, with ftcir Subaltern Officers, under the Appellatior of Spirits , these execute the Commands of their P*.ulers. The People of this Government, are known by the Denomination of Shelterers-, while we are dignify'd by the Title of Ber.chns. There happen'd at at a Coffee Houle Jiete last Week, to be a mixt Company of Benchers and Shelterers

amorj

among whom a Ditpute arose, which were to be accounted most able. The first Aifcdg'd, thar. their Go\ e: n uent bring Mona cbicat^ It mufi: be allow d the most Glorious Spcci scf Dominion, and that from the moil Ilioftrions Presidents: That one Suprtme Being rul'd in Heav'n; One Sun Gov. rn'd the Day, one Moon the Night; The Bealls acknowledg'd rhe Lion's Supremacy \ the Bi'dt, the Eagles, &c. The Shelterers added, and one Devil Rules in Hell, doublets the Damn'd much value their Happiucfs upon it: But allowing the Monarch's proper 5;aion robe Glorious, the Subjects fntf.r Slavery, Comparatively to the Immunitcs enjoy'd by a Free-Peofle. Upon that Paid a Nuiral Person (who had Superceeded his Actions which render'd him a Prifooer, but continued a Shelterer for fear of more) Let us decline Arguments on Government in General, and fticle to the Merits of rhe Causes, which brought us all hither, and allow the Preference to that Party, which can plead moll Honour in their proper Circumstances. On that (said the Bencher*, we come hither in a Legal way, having Ho* notnably surrendet'd to our Bail; You come in Defiance of the Legislative Power, where you liv'd; and Maintain your Selves here by Force and Violence, like the Banditti and Wild Arabs. Said the other, if you value your Selves so much upon being Prifomrs, 'ris wliac we all might have been with Ease, had we been so Charm'd with that Condition of Life, as to have Sacrific'd our Entire Liberty to it, You might, indeed, (said the Others) have been Prisoners, and Dependants on the Basket, but few of you are able to purchase Chamber-Pent and the Ktiles, or have so much Reputation left, as to procure Security for the last: We flay Abroad as long as we can, in hopes of proving Solvent to our Creditors, you come only with Design to Defraud 'em. But you mull Grant (Answer'd the Shelterers) that all our Proceedings are Mannag'd by the strictest Rules of Honour after our Arrival ro rhis Place, which may Attonc for former Slips; when a Bailiff, his follower, or Settee, are but suspected to be such, p Jury Sits on him for Probation, before Execution. We neither Protest a Person who has refus'd to Surrenderee his Bail, nor a Bankrupt, who has not submitted to Conditions impos'd by Law j nor yet a Rascal, who has newly taken up Goods, on purpose to Cheat Honest Men, this all the Woild say of u?, the World (argu'd the Benchers) do say this of you, but not in Respect to your Reputation, but rather by way of Sarcasm, that such a Villain, not even Shcherers Will Protest. Admitting (said the Shelterers) your Honour outlines ours; yet our Liberty exceeds yours; one Day in«SevM being our. own, where we please; and many Wifemen, have Sacrific'd their Honour to the Enjoyment of their Liberty. Many Knaves have (reply'd the other), but our Liberty every Day is more exrenfive than yours: In Term time under Protection of a Ticket, we can Rove where we pleTe with Impu* ni;y; and every Morning can go to Prayers at St. George's Church, into wliwh you dare not thrust your Noses. As often as you do thrust your I Jose, (laid the other) and we believe a Privation of that Liberty, wou'd as UtileAffeft you, as us. — Upoa this the Mob in rheScrccr, Cry'd out, a

55S

a bailiff, a bailiff, a bailiff; away [scowr'd?] the Shelterers to fill up the Cry, and assist the execution, and le[f]t the Benchers the Glory of the Field. As Contests often arise here on these Matters, so when any other Arguments are offer'd Pro or Con; the[y?] shall faithfully be convey'd to you by, Sir,

Yours, & c.

LETTER VIII.

SIR,

I Have hither'o declin'd giving any Account of the Fair Sex, because the Task is almost as difficult, as t wan'd be odunvife agreeable; since *tis almost impossible to write any thing New on that Subject-, hut upon Re-cogitation, that Tome Qualifications fbine more em.inently in'em here, than in chose among you, I'd acquaint you with what has as yet come to ray -knowledge on that Head. The com.non fort appear, not only Peop-e of another World, but also to be Form'd out of other Matter, than chose with you are; or rather out of a Complication of Ingredients; thei' Hji.cs of fi'enfcoit, their Hearts of Marble, and their Tongues of Ec&fir.ezal-, But, indeed, the Female Mob every where, are a kind of Antidotes, agiinfr ail Inclinations to the Sex. But there are anrthsr fort, tin. Citizen's young Wives, who redeem the Reputation, the other loose; rhefe used to be communicative of their Blessings, while among you, oral! our Fernand Zalui-sirgers are Romancers: But now- their Opportunities give'em greater Indulgence, from their Husband's Reltraint, than they had on-that kde, from an Excuse to a Mcrni.-g-Lecture, or a Visit to a Count;y Coufcn. They have often occasion also, to vine young Lawyers at their Chamber?, who are generally better bred, and of a more merciful Dupoittian, than to deny Succour to Ladies in Distfef-; nor is ti,s Husband much wrong'd hereby, fmee he may have sufficient left for himself: Be lines how can he expect Relief in his Wants,-when he refuses to others, an Over plus he has no occasion for. They have often frequent Opportunities-for Assignadons at SEn.b's Gaidens, with our young Dernier s, who are feldem breugh: hither, for being Bankrupt'd in their Stock of Ail-rar.ce; it wou'd be very ungenerous to decl.ne their Favours to such, as rhk-the- Terrour5 of Tcape-V.'arcants for their Sakes, fame ancient tfcjiicnts likewise are here,-who have young Daughters which have too much Filial Duty, to fee their aged Barents wart, when they can relieve'em, and by such agreeable Means. Bur what we m.i: abound in, are Zau. type's even enough to give occasion for the Founding a Col-.

LETTER IX

sir,

Your Refftciion is very just, that my Narrative will remain unperfect, 'till I give you some Account of our structures, and how inhabited; which I shall therefore take this Opportunity to represent to you. Our Edfica for the most parr, hold rather Proportion, with those of the ancient Stoirtr, than of the Epic, runs; and their Antiquity confutes that vulgar Error, that our Fore atliers much exceeded us in Height^ iince a Mid.dle-fiz'd Man now, will near touch the Ceilings; However, we;e they Lofty, they wou'd hold with the Models of your Modern Talacos, o.fj. one Fair of Stairs and a Cock-loft. The InfiJe-Walls retain their Original Whitcneis,- except where they are disguis'd, with: moak, footy Serges, or the Story of Xebuchain^ar; and tho'che Rooms are not feented with rich Gum?, yet they smell. full as lirong as if they were. The Landlady of the.first I enter'd, I wou'd have sworn to'have been a Witch, by her Wayward Look, and her Brats, her Familiars, by their Frightful Afpecis, and was just upon enquiring of her, after the Deltinyjaf an old Aunt of mine, who hath long grown too Good for this World; but that -I fooff found her Knowledge extended no further, than to let a Price upon her Lodgings, which was more for one Month, than all. the Furniture of her Fabrick was worth, with her own Accoutrements thrown into the Bargain. However, this is a kind of a Mod-Lonim, for we have our Lombarifirect as well as you; but.no Bankers in it. Lolling in their gilt Coaches, maintain'd by Extortion; no Lending of Money at 4.0per Cet.t, Discount to young Merchants for defraying Customs, with a Pledge of Well-stock'd Warehonles for Security besides. No supplying the Extravagances of young Heits, ro Che DistnUtion of their Families, w ith the like Dil-counts, besides Interest and a good Morrgage. No encring on Possession of Estates, immediately upon Forfeiture, except a round Sum of Continual ion- Money be instantly paid .- So far are oar Lombardians from coveting such heaps of Gold by Oppression, thac. few of 'em remember what Colour that Metal is of; but on the contrary, one shall be contented with the modest Profit he can rail'e from a Wheelbarrow of Turnips; another, instead of having his bhop glittering with polish'd Ik ate and jewels, to Che hurting the Eyes of I aflengers,lhdll think it sufficiciuly Furnish'd with a parcel of Mouse-Trap , iavealls and Nutcrackers, while their Wives in If cad of shining with Diamond', Tilfues, and Brocades, humbly content themselves wich -brails of Gingerbread, Apples, and . Cabbages; or with the Heeling of old Hufe. Nor do they, like yours, require large. Rooms with ifately Furniture, for fear of briny; ltiflcd in too ifrait Compass, but frugally crowd a Family in a Room, where rbeir Mcam supplies thewantof Coals, tokeep. 'em warm.
