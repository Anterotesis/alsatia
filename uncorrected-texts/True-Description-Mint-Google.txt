TO THE

Gentry of the MINT,

Howsoever Distinguish'd, whether

BENCHERS or SHELTERERS.

Gentlemen,

I Do not doubt but I shall have many a bitter Curse for my Definition of the Mint, but 'tis below me to take notice of those Curs, who can only Grin and not Bite. I follow the Golden Rule of rendering to every Man what is his Due. I Appeal to You, who are the properest Judges, for the Truth of the following Relation: And if I am a little Severe on the Mob, (those Shrubs, that Live under you tall Cedars) I hope I make Amends in wiping off the Odium which is so universally cast upon the people of the Mint. By declaring everything at large (tho in few Words) I am Confident I have brought over a great many to Favour you, who being Prejudiced before (esteeming this Place much worse than the fryars, in obstructing

the Execution of Justice) are sensible of their Error, in setting every thing in a clear Light.

The antient Romans Conquer'd much, and lost it again; but You, like a careful, provident, industrious Heir, keep entire not only what was left you, but have increas'd your Patrimony, remembring the Words of the Poet,

Non minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tueri.

May your Power, your Priviledges, and your Liberties never be diminished, but increased rather than lessen'd: For, as a late Judge said, they that are Confin'd there (meaning the Mint) suffer Misery enough: So may the Higher Power say to you, as Venus did to AEneas,

Perge modo et qua te ducit via dirige gressus.

This is the sincere Desire, and shall be back'd, upon Occasion, by the small Interest of,

Gentlemen, Your Humble Servant;

A True Description of the

Mint and Minters.

THERE are few People, I believe, so very Ignorant, but know that a Mint is a place appointed for Coining, or making the Lawful Money of the Realm; and 'tis from hence, that the Subject of the following Treatise does originally derive its Name. I shall not trouble my Reader with its Chronology, let it be sufficient to assure him, that it is of greater Antiquity than the Fryars, or any other Place that usurp'd a Priviledge; and we may reasonably conclude, that it is preferable and superior to them, not only from its retaining its Customs, when those others are abolish'd and destroy'd, but for many other Reasons, which shall be made appear in their proper place.

O Mint! Thou kind and hospitable Hostess, who readily dost stretch forth thy Arms to embrace those that will fly unto thee, who refuseth not to Shelter all that will come under thy Wing! May you always be thus favourable. Thou, who art the Defender of the Fatherless, Supporter of the Widow, and Succourer of the poor insolvent Debtor; who being Protected by thee, can safely take his Rest, secure from the devouring Jaws of the insatiable Creditor: May your good Intentions prosper, your Power be continued, and may you ever remain without Corruption or Dissention.

Tho' some People repine at this place of Refuge,

( 6 )

and endeavour all they can to Destroy those that are in it; yet after all, 'tis but a kind of Purgatory, or Middle-state, a Medium between close Confinement, and absolute Liberty. And if our Freedom be an estimable Jewel, a Purchase we would not part with, it must certainly be a great Mortification to any Man, that is depriv'd of it six Days in seven, who being penn'd up in such narrow Compass, dares not stir beyond its Precincts, without running the greatest Risque imaginable.

Had they to whom we are Indebted, any Compassion, were they endu'd with the least Grain of Charity, they could not but think this Place a sufficient Punishment for those they Compel to remain here: But such is the Malice, such the Avarice of some Men, that tho' they are sensible that the Person they Arrest has not wherewith to Pay them, nay, can scarce get Bread to eat, yet will they call him Head-long into a Goal; and thereby not only render him utterly incapable of ever giving them what is their Due, but the poor Prisoner must Perish in a short time, and leave his Bones to Satisfy their greedy Minds.

I am Confident, there is no Debtor would willingly abide here, could he Live safely in another Place; for the anxious Thoughts of being in continual Jeopardy if he stirs abroad, and his being Confin'd to the various Humours of the confused Multitude, the medly of people that is in the Mint, is enough to Distract him For 'tis here, as in Charon's Boat, you must throw off your Pride, be prepar'd for long-Suffering, and cloath yourself with Humility and Patience (of which you had need have a large Stock) and retain nothing but Money to Defray the Charges of your Residence; for no longer Pipe, no longer Dance.

I cannot Treat so Distinctly (as I do design) of the Liberties, Privilidges, Laws, and Customs of this Place;

( 7 )

nor the Manners, (which are very few) Nature, and Temper of the People, without making a Distinction of the Inhabitants, or Body Politick; which is a Compound of Three, or to speak more intelligibly, is divided into Three Ranks, or Classes, the Benchers, Shelterers, and the Minters.

And as there is a small Dispute, who it was that first brought up, and who it is that does at present maintain and uphold the Priviledges of the Mint; I shall endeavour to end the Difference, and set these matters in a clear Light: In order to which, I must begin with the first Branch of my Division, namely, the Benchers.

I. Of the BENCHERS.

These are a mixture of all Degrees of Mankind, who are either Arrested, and so Confin'd by a Queen's-Bench-Writ, or else they remove themselves hither from Other Prisons (the Fleet excepted) by Virtue of an Habeas Corpus. The Rules or Liberties of the Queen's-Bench were in former Days very small; they reach'd out from a little below the Prison to St. George's Church, including one side of it; but in process of time, the Mint was annex'd thereto, which extended as far as the present Sign of the Two Fighting Cocks Westward, and was border‘d on the South with the Ditch which divides it from St. George's Fields; and at the North-side it had a Gate at the hither-end of White-Cross-street. These were the Antient Boundaries of the Mint.

Now, to undeceive the Reader, who may think perhaps, that every Prisoner has the Liberty of the Rules of the Bench, I must acquaint him, that this Favour is granted only to such as can Purchase it, and give

( 8 )

Security for their not running away; tho' rather than fail, their own Bond, with a handsome Gratuity, will serve; the Nature of performing it is thus. You either get some Friend who is acquainted with the Marshal, or else you go to him yourself, and make your Conditions upon as easy Terms as you can; but you must consider, that nothing is to be done rashly, therefore a Bottle or two is a good Preparative. Neither must you Repine if you do not accomplish your Design the first time; for as he cannot tell how many Actions you have charg'd against you, and how Weighty they may be, what Character you bear, and whether your Security be substantial, so a Second or Third Meeting, you know, is very proper, for the refreshing and supporting Nature. But supposing you do bring things to bear, and obtain your Desire, yet there's Half Crown a Week for Chamber-Rent, tho' you never go near it, which must be punctually paid upon Demand, or you suffer for it severely.

Tho' some People may think 'tis very easy for those Who have the Priviledge of the Rules, to make their Escape, which is not impossible, yet is there much more Difficulty in it than at first imagin'd. For the Marshal has at least Threescore Spies, some of whom are Gentlemen, and are glad to curry Favour upon any account. These Emissaries are dispers'd into most Companies, they insinuate themselves into your Acquaintance, make private Enquiry what Hours you keep, how, or after what rate you Live, whether you have plenty of Money, and such like; and then, according to their information, they make their Report to the Marshal, so that you cannot turn any way but you have an Eye over you. But should a Prisoner escape, it would not break the Marshal's Heart, for he seldom continues longer than Three Years successively, and then exchanges

( 9 )

with the Warden of the Fleet, and are generally each others Prisoner.

I hope the Reader will pardon the Digression I am going to make, since it may be partly beneficial, not only to the Benchers, but to those whose Misfortune it may prove to be Prisoners: And first as concerning the latter; I would advise every Person that designs to turn himself over to the Queen's-Bench, to get a Friend to treat with Marshal, before he has brought his Habeas Corpus,by which means he will save considerably; for if he proffers any thing reasonably, the Marshal will be glad to accept of it, esteeming it a piece of Prudence, to play at Games rather than stand out. For, thinks he, shou'd I refuse this Offer, he will apply himself to the Warden of the Fleet, who will be glad to receive it. But if you remove your self without Compounding, then you lye wholly at his Discretion; who, if you be Fat, will have as much Mercy on you, as a Hawk has of his Prey; and before you get from under his Roof, you must expect to share the same Fate with a Sheep that comes from under a Hedge, lose a Fleece or two, and be glad you come off so well.

A Second Advice to the Benchers in general is this, Let no Man know your Concerns; make no Body acquainted with your Circumstances, neither be familiar with too many; and if you have occasion to go to to London, or elsewhere, either do it privately and singly, or go in Company with but one or two and let 'em be Persons whom you know have gone out pretty often. For if the Marshal finds you out, he immediately Calls you in, pretending you might be taken upon an Escape-Warrant, and when you are a Second Time in close Confinement, you must expect to Pay a much rounder Sum to get out, than you did for your first Enlargement.

( 10 )

II. Of the SHELTERERS, and the present Limits of the MINT.

Having Treated of the Benchers as succinctly as possible, the Shelterers follow next: And here is a Composition enough to poison the Devil; Here is Tag-rag and Bob-tail all sorts of Trades, Professions, and Religions, from the Circumcised Jew, down to the Pharisaical Christian, who, in the main, is as great a Reprobate, as any Infidel, Jew, or Heathen! Not but there are some good, honest Men, though their number is small. It may be enquir'd, how these People got footing in this place: Why truly, I design to reveal that Mystery; therefore to answer the Question the Querist must know that the Number at first was very thin; that they took Shelter under the Bencher's Wings, these were their Protectors, and they had their Invitation from them. If we give Credit to the Report of some malicious People, we shall find that this Kindness of theirs, was rather a Principle of Self-Satisfaction, than an Act of Charity to Relieve those they took under their Umbrage, as is concluded from hence. Revenge is what we are very prone too, and so depraved is Man's Nature, that instead of forgiving an Injury, he endeavours all he can to return it. Now the Bailiffs, those Caterpillars of the Nation, being the Occasion of the Benchers losing their Liberty, they invited some of their Neighbours who were about to forsake their Habitations, for fear of an Arrest, to come and Live among them; these they suppos'd would prove a Bait, a Train to get the aforemention'd Vermin within their Clutches; and then fearless of any Punishment, they cou'd inflict what Punishment on 'em they thought fit.

There were but few Houses in the Mint in those Day s, so that when any of these Riots happen'd, either

Nay; so Jealous are these poor Souls of having their Privileges infring'd, that they often Expel some j of their own Fraternity upon Sufpidion,; and if any

Proof can be brought again!! them, they /how 'em no -Compassion, thinking no Treatment too Vile for their Treachery. And as there a re Three principal Avenues or Entries to the Mint, so have they Three or

Meetings', to Try and:Decide whatever fliaD happen in their Division. But of them hereafter.

III. Of the MINTE

The M'mters are those who have been Prisoners formerly, and reflde there still; or else they are Horde-keepers, who dwell there, and go abroad at their Plea* Pure. Of the latter, Sammy Greaves, a good-humour'd hearty CV£, who fears pot to fhoWhis Face before a Lord-Mayor, God.bless himbut hehas a Wife, and /he is a - — -, so I'll say no more of her . Neither maift I pass by that facetious, jolly old Fellow,- Daddy Cotv ftr; for not to mention him* would be to do his Virtues 'Wrong. He is upwards of Seventy Ye&vof lAge, and

IV. Of ‘the. inhabitan

Tht Multitude of the Inhabitants is so great, 'tis im possible to Treat distinctly of every particular Person; for, so many Men,so many Minds And if such variety

of. Hutnoursin this Sex, what must there be among the 'FtmaleSj who make up Four Parts in Nine, at least ? For the generality of 'em, they are willing to entertain all that Will come to them; very Courteous and Obliging as long as your Money last; respe<3; you while a Stranger, (that u, for the frft timtthey fee you) for afterwards 'tis Hail Fedm, wed met; and they are as well Skiffd in the Artirfflattery, as if they had been bred up Courtiers; ' None can play the Hypocrite better than they for, What is it they wiilnptdVtogainany

Thu is their Character in Epitome; their Effigies in Miniature. But the Reader muff understand, that all the Inhabitmts do not Answer this Description, I mean only those who are the Scum and Dregs of the rest, who notwithstanding bear equal Sway with them, ft* being the major-part;and they are very distinguishftf£

ble, therefore the easier to be avoided. A Man may' meet with feme good Company among the Sorts be* fore-mentton'd, who are affable, good-natur'd, well?' bred, but you muff not be taken up So much with^ them, as not tofuffer the mean Sort, or more illiterate to Speak to you, as you tender your Peace and Quiet* nefs during your Abode among them.

But what you win judge snoft Severe is, that ydushall have it bat from one Quarter*s~eni to another; and if you fail to Pay the Rent the Day on whichit becomes Due, expect your Goods to be Sese'd upon the next; nay, after all, fbou'd Another bid more thin you, the' are in Possession, you mud Fay what the other raises you to, or turn out. Now, if they that take Houses bear so great a Burden, theta judge how hard it most light upontbofe whoare JLsigets; 'these are the great ed Sufferers; they mud snake of die Laffet of the former; and I can Adore the Reader, that Chamber*Rent is much Cheaper about the 'Court, {eornparatfcely / or, the middle of the C«y, than it is in this place.

There

lately happened an Instance of what I have, laid.-;'

A certain Lad) who'keepslHousein the Mint, Ow'd 4

Butcher Twenty Shillings, and her Rents

so punctual as ex pelted,jhecould not ptcy.the greasy Reg tie

according to' Ptomife; upon which he rgfks^d to give her any f urther Credit, by which', means the Jack Ten Days. r Now, the 'Tody rods, drove \o htr Usi ftrftty in prder to conceal this Misfortune from her Neighbours, and keep up her Reputation among , to

and at tail thought it more adviseato leave her fine Scarf

as a Hoftagefor the TwentyShillings4'ShouIder of Mut>

ton, and aBufhel of Coals, till th Equivalent,

should be returtdd. Thus poor Jack: was employ'd for a fjnall time; an d the Smoke demo, that the Hou fe wo

not always without Fire; and't h Lady thought herself very secure from her Neighbours knowing, what Her dfhipsfbt

was reduc'd to: But, alas! deceiv'd in

our Expectations ! the Scarf was not in the Butcher'/ pop

session Half an Hour, but'heexpos'd it to all the Comers

and Goers, as a Raree-Qaow. So the Story took Wind, but the Laiy regarded it not;

: I believe a Man may venture to conclude, without being censured for to Judge rafbly, that these jpeople will scarce get nearer Heaven tha they are present, except what Advances they may-make at 7iburn, King-ft one,or some such Place; for not to take cognizance of their Actions, 'tisvifible they have as little Faith as eit ther Turk or jew, and without that, 'tis impossible to ueach the Mansions above.

( *7 )

VI. Of their Nature add

Having spoke very much in a few Words, concerning the Inhabitants, the Reader may think there can be but little more said that relates to them; I shall there* lore briefly Speak of their Nature and Temper.

They are a fott oF Jamals made up of all the ill Qualities incident to Mankind; They are (Ubjeft to every iK Difpafttion of Mind, and addicted to all manner

Of Vice. 'Tis not safe to put any Confidence in them } ifor tho* they dare not be known to be uif yet*

fora frnall Reward, they will blandeflinely Betray you. They are Infolept, Saucy, and Impertinent, verifying the Old Proverb, Ptbud and Beggxtty; they afe highly Opt* tiionated of themselves; very F-indiffive, and care not What base Means they pursue, to obtain their Ends: Scolding and Brawling are their Two Favourites; and there is no People under the Sun so They

are idle, loose, and f.ethful, and naturally inclin'd to Filth and Nttfliness: They will Faff one Day to get Dr uric

the next, and let their Backs go uncover'd to make Van* mis' of their Throats.Mon*} and are not very intimately acquainted; and when they are Mxfiers of it$ think every Minute an Hour, till they get to an Ale-Hot/fe so Spend it.

This is the True Description of that many-Htaded-Monfier, the Mob of the Mint: Nor is their Temper any ways disproportionable, but congruous, and fukable to their Nature. They are , and Mo-

tofe, and Surly to the last Degree; if at any time they receive a Favour jthey fail not to Revile and Spurn at the

Giver. Their Countenances are Sour, and yOu may

5erceive their Conditions in their Faces; they never Jorg*ty or Forgive an Injury, but will w atcli an Opportunity to return it; for Revenge is their deftfxS^rlingi

( 18 )

Friendship they profess, but will not practice; and it goes against their Grain to own an Obligation, As for the Women, they are Proud, Talkative, (a Quality inherent to the Sex) Self-conceited and Lascivious, prone tp all manner of I.ewdnefs; and they have the most convenient Opportunity to accomplish their Designs that can be. For, since their Husbands cannot go abroad,they Soliicit and manage theirBufinefs for them; and under the Notion of Compounding their Debts, create new Ones where they can get Credit: They open their Husbands Cafe to their Lawyer; and if they

lye qji&a Night or two /no matter with whom) no Fault must be found with them, for the Husband, good Man, knows that Money cannot be had so readily at the first time of asking; Besides what or

Attorney, will do his work without a Fee ? What a hopeful progeny much such wicked Parents produce ? Nav to give them their due, they take as little care a* j bout the Education of their Children, as any People whatever- Theyare very assiduous in planting a mortal Aversion to Barn-Bat lip in the Minds of their Young Ones; for, as other People terrify their Children with , the tremendous Names of Bugaboo, and Raw-Head and Bloody Bones, lo they use theirs with the hideous Word BAILIFF; and they have such natural Antipathy to these curfedlnje£lj,that when they have them within their Power, they make them Sensible of their Abhorrence to them, by the double Punishment they inftift upon them, as shall be ihown in the following Head. ;

---

( 19 )

VII. Of their Clubs and Meetings, and the manner of Punishing a BAILIFF.

There are Three principal Ways, by which you come into the Mint; and at or near every one of these Entries, there is a Club, or Meeting of the Shelterers: One in Mint-street, a Second in White-Cross-street, and a Third near the Two Fighting Cocks. They assemble together at least Twice a Week; neither does one intrude upon, or meddle with what happens within the Precincts of another, but every Body takes Cognizance of what Offence is committed within the Limits of his own Ward.

---

The principal Design of keeping these Clubs was, not only to Punish the , but for another good End, by which it will appear ( as I promis'd before) that the Mint was always Superior and Preferable to the Friars, or other places of Priviledge; For they refuse not to suffer a Warrant to be Sefv'a within their Jurisdiction, provided it is not dcfign'd to Trepan some Person that is in there for Debt; neither will they Protect these who have a Comifjion of Bankrupt out against them, but will suffer them, or their Effects,to be carried away by a Confable,without Molestation. And

further, to manifest they have no sinister Design in keeping up their Priviledges, will appear by their allowing any Vagabond who comes within the Description of the Act, to be sent for a Solaier. Nor will they Harbour any Person who has run away from his but deliver him up to those who make their Application to the Clubs. Hence it is vifihle, that their main Intent is to Defend those from a Prison, who have not Sufficient; to Pay their Creditors, who are so very as to

have the Skin off their Bones, by endeavouring to call: 'em into a worse place than their Graves* Fo^Af^r all the Pains and Anxieties of Mind and Body do cease ;

( 20 ).

but in a Goal, they increase Daily, sometimes to the Ruin both of Soul and Body.,

'Tis to be Observed, That in every Club there is a Steward, who upon any Tryal fits as Judge ovPr eft dent, attended by Si* Bodies with their long Staves headed

with Silver. Nor is any person taken upon Suspicion, whether Bailiff, Setter, or Follower, Condemn'd with*" out Froo f; so Just a re they in their Proceedings.

When they lay hold of a Per fen, the Club is instanN ly Summon'd, and the Party hocus'd, defir'd to Strip from Head to Toe, and turn out the inside of his Pockets, producing his Papers, &f. If he refuse so tp do, the Beadles perform it for him; and they are very careful that he lofts nothing, for whatever Money, or thing of Value is about him, is return'd to him* If after a diligent, and narrow Scrutiny, they find no Warrants, Writs, or Act ions about him, here ( as in alfCourts of Judicature )he is ask'd. Who, and what^ he is, the Place of his Abode, As Toon as he has Satisfied them here? in, they Depute feme Trusty Fellow, who goes npar the place where the Prisoner directs them; and being a crafty, cunning Rogue, brings the matter about, by enquiring if fucha Person who is a Officer, doe*

not Live^thereabout; arid ceases not tijlhe is felly Sa? tisfy'd, whether he be Bahff, Setter, or Bottomry if either of the Two latter, he is never favoured in his Em ecucfon; and the Reason they alledge is, That the Bahff only does his Duty, and has Authority for it j but the follower and Setter have not, therefore often meet with double Punishment.

But to return; The Messenger having got wfat Intelligence he can, comes back, and makes his Report accordingly; and if the Persan be not as they suspe£b him, then he. is discharg'd; the' there is f reaohery often in this way, by the Mefleqger's being Brib'd *0 1 make a lalfe Report; but Woe unto him if he be di

Having so said, he killed the Book which was a Brickbat, daubed over with a Sir-rev this they rub about his Face and Ibmetimes in his Mouth. The Ceremony thus ended he was dismissed. But if at parting the Prisoner forgets to pay the Spirits their Fees; that is, if he bribes them not, then the Apprentices and Women cause him to undergo the punishment twice, but if he be liberal, he is conduced out of the Bounds of the Mint, and so elcapes a {econd Ditching.

VIII: Of the MINT in General

It mail be confess'd, that he who can walk to the utmost Extincts of the Mint, is still under Restraint, but as the Pleasure and Satisfaction of Liberty consists in Contentment of Mind, he that is endued therewith may live in the Mint as well as any where else: For what Enticement, what Variety have you in London, which may not be found in the Mint? What Pastimes, what Sports, Allurements and Diversions have you Citizens and Suburbians, which we have not here ? Tho' not in such plenty; in which we have this Advantage, that whereas you are clog'd and Surfeited with so much, we have but just enough, which renders it more acceptable, pleasing, & delightful. Does the Citt value himself for his Royal-Exchange; little thinking, that whilst he is Bartering the re, his Wife is Consummating what she bargain'd for before. So have we our Square, and usual Houses of meeting, and within Smell of our Habitations: And where many a Rich Merchant walks in the Year, without fear of a Searjeant's plucking him by the Coat. They go to Mary-bone and Islington to Bowls, we to Cuperts and Moor-shanks; they boast their Sun-Tavern behind the Exchange, we have our Freind Isaac behind our Square, who has Wine and Brandy of the best. Have they e'er a rich Banker that cheated his Creditors? Why we can match him with a S----ome Body? You boast your Lombard Street; so do we; but with this Difference JUSTICE is not ashamed to show her Face in Hours by Night or Day. You have a very famous put-together-House in the City; we have a Noted Baudy House as you enter into St. George's Fields; & as you have Drury-Lame, Wild-street, and other Places for the Ladies of Pleasure, we but cross over the Ditch, and at a Whiffle, can have 20 or 30 Brace of Marlins in an Instant: In short, we can equal you in every respect, in every way, whether lawful or unlawful, which tends to human Life. Bridges-street and Charing Cross, are usual Rendevouz where you go to throw a merry Main, and try whether the Money you have be yours or another Body's; there you meet with your Sharpers to . Butter a Cul; Nor are we behind hand with you in this point; for at the Sign of the Angel, we can play all Day and Night too; and honest Jack can top or palm with any Man; he has your high and low, flat and smooth: But I care not to Drink after

my Landlord, lest I should get more than I desire, and challenge me with finding his Palate. While you go to the Mulbery, or Spring-Garden, we recreate our selves at the Sign of the Chimney-Sweeper, or at the Red-Cow; but if your Philosophy has taught you to be frugal, and not drink brewed Wine but content your selves with a Mug of Nappy-Ale, why, the George in East-Cheap, the Horseshoe in blow-bladder-street,
