And be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Debtors and others who were in Prison on or before the Twenty fourth day of June, One thousand seven hundred and nineteen, in the several Goals of this Kingdom, for want of Paying their Fees or Charges due to the Keeper or Goaler of any Prison respectively, or to any other Officer, (and upon no other Account) such Fees or Charges, not exceeding the Sum of Forty Shillings, shall be discharged, he, she, or they taking the Oath required by this Act.

Provided always, That no Person shall be discharged out of Prison, or have any Benefit or Advantage by Force or Virtue of this Act, who shall really and bona fide stand charged and be indebted in more than the Sum of Fifty Pounds for Debt, besides Interest, Damages, and Costs of Suit, to any one Person.

And whereas it was, for encouraging Bankrupts to make a Discovery of, and to deliver up their Estates and Effects for the Benefit of their Creditors, by an Act Passed the last Session of this present Parliament, Intituled, An Act for the better Preventing Frauds committed by Bankrupts, Enacted, amongst other Things, That every Person against whom a Commission of Bankrupt had, since the Twenty first Day of May, One thousand seven hundred and sixteen, issued, or should issue during the Continuance of the said Act, whereupon such Person had been, or should be declared a Bankrupt, who should discover and deliver up all his Estate and Effects to the Commissioners by the said Commission authorized for the Benefit of his Creditors, and in all things conform as in and by the said Act is directed, should be discharged from all Debts by him, her, or them due or owing at the time that he, she, or they did become Bankrupt; and that in case any such Bankrupt should afterwards be arrested, prosecuted or impleaded for any Debt due before such time as he, she, or they did become Bankrupt, such Bankrupt should be discharged upon Common Bail, and should and might plead in general that the Cause of such Action or Suit did accrue before such time as he, she, or they did become Bankrupt, and might give the said Act and the Special Matter in Evidence: And whereas it was by the said Act Provided and further Enacted, That no such Discovery, as aforesaid, should entitle such bankrupt or Bankrupts to the Benefits allowed by the said Act, unless the said Commissioners should, in Writing under their Hands and Seals, certifie to the Lord Chancelloer or Lord Keeper, or Commissioners for the Custody of the Great Seal of Great Britain, that such Bankrupt or Bankrupts had made a full Discovery of his, her, or their Estates and Effects, and in all Things conformed himself, herself, or themselves, according to the Directions of the said Act, and unless Four Parts in Five in Number and Value of such Bankrupts Creditors, who should have duly proved their Debts under such Commission, should sign such Certificate, and testifie their Content to the said Certificate, and to such Bankrupts Discharge in pursuance of the said Act; and unless such Bankrupt should make Oath that such Certificate and the Content of the Creditors thereunto were obtained fairly and without Fraud; and unless such Certificate should after such Oath be allowed and confirmed by the Lord Chanceller, Lord Keeper, or Commissioners for the Custody of the Great Seal of Great Britain, or by such Two of the Judges of the Courts of Kings Bench, Common Please, or Court of Exchequer at Westminster, to whom the Consideration of such Certificate should be referred: And whereas Bankrupts, notwithstanding they have made such Discovery, and delivered up all their Estates and Effects, and obtained such Certificate from the said Commissioners, and such Certificate hath been allowed and confirmed, as aforesaid, have yet been some times taken in Execution, and detained in Prison, to the utter Ruin of their Families, on Account of Debts owing by them before they became Bankrupts, by reason that Judgment was obtained against them before their Certificates were allowed and confirmed, as aforesaid; and a Doubt having arisen whether such Bankrupts in Execution upon such Judgments can, by Virtue of the said Act, be discharged out of Custody, as by the said Act was intended, without such Bankrupts bringing a Writ of Audita Querela, the Charge of which they are in no ways able to bear after delivering up all their Estates and Effects: Be it therefore further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be Lawful for any one or more of the Judges of the Court wherein Judgment has been so obtained against such Bankrupt, on such Bankrupts producing such Certificate, as aforesaid, allowed and confirmed, as aforesaid, and entred of Record, according to the Directions of the said Act, to order any Sheriff or Sheriffs, Bailiff or Officer, Goaler and Keeper of any Prison, who hath or shall have any Bankrupt in his Custody by Virtue of such Execution, to discharge such Bankrupt out of Custody on such Execution without Payment of any Fee or Reward; and such Sheriff or Sheriffs, Bailiff and Officer, Goaler and Keeper, are hereby required to discharge such Bankrupt out of Custody accordingly, and are hereby Indemnified from any Action for an Escape for his or their so doing.
