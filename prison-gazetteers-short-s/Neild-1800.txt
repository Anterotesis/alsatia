TO THE

RIGHT HONOURABLE

LORD ROMNEY,

PRESIDENT

OF THE

SOCIETY FOR THE DISCHARGE AND RELIEF OF PERSONS IMPRISONED FOR SMALL DEBTS.

My Lord,

The patronage of your noble Father to this Society, in the infancy of its institution, was an auspicious presage of its success.

To your Lordship’s unremitting assiduities it is indebted, in a great measure, for its present celebrity and estimation.

The Author of the following Report was stimulated to the pursuit of inquiries, which have at length produced it, by the excessive dearness of provisions, and the difficulties of the poorer classes of mankind even to exist.

iv DEDICATION.

If this humble endeavour to display that extreme distress, to which the indigent (though not fraudulent) debtor is reduced, may prove the means of ameliorating his hapless condition, it will afford the highest gratification to.

My Lord,

Your Lordship's

Most faithful and obedient servant,

JAMES NEILD.

Chelsea, 4th June, 1800.

ADVERTISEMENT.

To the considerate reader of the following statement a few observations must naturally occur.

He will feel for their pitiable situation, who, though confined in prison, have, in some instances, no support at all provided for them: in many, scarcely bread to eat sufficient to maintain life; and whose case, therefore, very powerfully calls for the humane interposition of the magistrate. He will find, with painful astonishment, that, after eight and twenty years since the institution of the Society for the Relief and Discharge of Debtors, no less than twenty-five prisons in England and Wales — some of them in large populous towns, and others very near the metropolis — have “never heard of” so amiable and excellent a charity! The fact is on record, from the avowal of the respective gaolers; and it must have considerably lessened the intended benefit deducible from the Society’s plan.

The Committee have now distributed their painted Boards of Instruction throughout the various gaols; and sincerely hope that the magistracy, in every district of the kingdom, will kindly further the views of this Society, by an occasional inquiry into the state of imprisoned Debtors; and by an inspection, now and then, into the manner of their treatment and accommodation in the dreary abodes of human wretchedness.

”Ah! little think the gay, licentious proud,

”Whom Pleasure, Power and Affluence surround;

”They, who their thoughtless hours in giddy mirth

”And wanton, often cruel riot, waste;

”Ah! little think they, while they dance along,

”How many pine in want, and dungeon glooms,

”Shut from the common air, and common use

“Of their own limbs ! How many drink the cup

”Of baleful Grief, or eat the bitter bread

”Of Misery — For sure, th' awakening thought

“The conscious heart of Charity would warm;

”The social tear would rise, the social sigh;

”The social passions work!”

14 ACCOUNT OF PERSONS

Extract of a Letter received from Mr. Newman, dated 15 April, 1800.

[His list of prisoners closes with the name of James Daugherty, confined for £ 1. 6s. 6d.]

“I beg leave to observe, that the last is one of that class of poor labouring men. who are frequently almost ruined by their imprisonment for such small sums, by losing their places, and their families being left to starve: not only during their confinement, but also until they can afterwards get into employ, and which might, in a great measure, be prevented, by a prompt tender of about ten shillings in the pound to their plaintiffs, at the time of commitment: who also, being poor persons, would, for the most part, accept the same, rather than lose the whole by confining their debtors for six weeks. It will require four of your Society’s painted boards, that all the debtors in this compter may be benefited thereby, there being four distinct divisions for debtors: but if one is hung up in the chapel, it will answer the purpose, and be one inducement to attend divine service: and I could wish that all benefit to prisoners came through the same medium; as it might tend to improve their morals, by making all their temporal benefits, in some measure, arise from a due attention to their duty towards their Creator. I shall at all times be much gratified by being“

CONFINED FOR DEBT. 15

“made one of the many instruments of the Society’s benevolence.”

GILTSPUR-STREET COMPTER.

J.A. NEWMAN, Keeper.

Rev. Mr. EDMAND, Chaplain. — Salary £.50 per Ann.

Debtors 49.

Allowance, &c. as follows; from Mr. Newman’s statement, by letter of the 12th April, 1800. “To common-side debtors only, the annual sum of fifty pounds, at unequal quarterly payments; or sometimes more, as one of the bequests is payable only once in three years: about two shillings per week in bread; and part of the forfeitures of offenders against penal statutes, which are sometimes distributed amongst the prisons by the Lord Mayor and other city magistrates: all which several donations are delivered to one of the prisoners, who acts as steward for the rest, and who advances money upon the credit of the said donations; out of which he reimburses himself, as the same becomes due. He pays five per cent. to a collector, and furnishes the charity wards with a constant supply of coals, wood, salt, candles, mops, brooms, and a news-paper; besides paying a weekly allowance to a basket-woman, to collect broken victuals at the taverns, and for other messages on account of such charity wards. The steward also contributes towards the support of

16 ACCOUNT OF PERSONS

such common-side debtors, as may, by the surgeon’s order, be placed in the sick ward; pays also a weekly allowance to the scavenger, and to his assistant, called the twelver. The steward is sometimes in danger of losing the money advanced by him, for want of a legal authority to recover the same.

The Sheriffs give seven stone of beef every Saturday to the charity wards; which is distributed, in equal shares, to such common-side debtors, as have attended, and properly demeaned themselves in the chapel, during divine service on the preceding Sunday.

The permanent gifts to prisoners of all descriptions, including the said debtors, are fourteen ounces of bread daily to each: one pound of beef, one pint of porter, and one loaf at three halfpence, at Christmas, to each prisoner: the same on New-year's day, at Easter, and on some uncertain days soon after, by the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, who also occasionally give coals.

Money is also given by several of the city companies, and others, towards the release of debtors, to a considerable amount; and is most frequently applied for by such of the debtors as cannot obtain their discharge without undertaking to pay a certain sum by instalments:“ and who, therefore, cannot avail themselves of our Institution, which requires a receipt in full.

Nevertheless, such debtors, in Ipswich gaol, as do not regularly attend divine service (unless prevented by sickness, or some reasonable cause, to be allowed of by the chaplain), and behave decently and reverently, shall not have any benefit or allowance from this charity.”

The allowance for debtors is about two pounds of beef each on Sundays; a pint of beer, and a twopenny loaf.

The knowledge of our Institution appears never to have reached this gaol till April, 1800. The debtors are not allowed small beer. Their pittance for bread, formerly, was only three half pence per day; but the magistrates, at the late quarter-session, ordered them to have a threepenny loaf each, daily, in future.

The allowance to debtors is three pennyworth of bread every morning. There is no chaplain: but, if one is required, the vicar, or the lecturer, of the parish of St. Andrew attends; who are both of them appointed by the corporation.

Debtors 32.

The common-side debtors have each fourteen ounces of bread per day, and six stone of beef divided amongst them every

40 ACCOUNT OF PERSONS

Saturday; besides a collection of broken victuals from the different taverns and eating-houses about the Exchange, the London tavern, the George and Vulture, the Cock eating-house, &c. And, much to the honour of his humanity, Mr. Deputy Birch, of Cornhill, has for many years sent, every day, the hot stewed beef and veal, from which soups and gravy are made. A sum of near eighty pounds is also collected yearly, and distributed once a quarter among the common-side debtors.

Those on the master’s side have rooms and beds to themselves, which the keeper furnishes at 2s. 6d. per week; but these have no part of any charity, except it be particularly ordered by the donor.

The keeper of the Poultry Compter appears to be a humane man. The prison is clean, but very close and crowded. To give the debtors and felons air, they are taken, alternately, upon the leaded roof. It is in a very ruinous and insecure state.

On my visiting this prison the 20th August, 1800, I found two children, who had been sent there some months before, as vagrants. No crime was alledged against them. The eldest boy appeared to be about thirteen; and ever since their commitment they had been confined with the felons! A letter to the lord mayor procured me an immediate answer from his lordship, assuring me that he would directly inquire into, and redress the

CONFINED FOR DEBT. 41

grievance. Mr. Teague the keeper’s letter, of 27th August, says, “The right honourable the lord mayor having favoured me with your very humane letter, addressed to his lordship, in behalf of the Boys confined in the Felons’ ward, I have the pleasure to acquaint you, that his lordship has recommended them to the Marine Society. The committee of city lands do not meet on business this month; but, as soon as they do, an immediate application will be made, to make some alteration in the prison, for the better accommodation and separation of the Vagrants from the Felons’ ward."

Three bushels of coals in the winter, per week. Sir Charles Marsh, visiting magistrate, in consequence of the dearness of provisions, has ordered a loaf of one pound and a half to be given to the poor debtors every other day, and two pounds of potatoes to each, every other alternate day.

N.B. The allowance for coals is from the magistrates’ fees.

poor. Many of them, of late, would have applied to the Society for relief, but from the idea that the prisoners of this court did not come under the cognizance of the Society; which, I confess, I myself understood was the case.”

Upon my visiting this prison the 2Sd of August, 1800, I found it clean and healthy; Mr. Simpson, the gaoler, having raised the court-yard, partly paved it, and laid the water on at his own expence.
